The term “sexually explicit conduct” is in turn defined to mean, among\nother things, “sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the term “sexual contact” means\n“the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast,\ninner thigh, or butocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse\nor gratify sexual desire of any person.” Jd. § 35o9(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the definition\nof “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a) to determine whether the statute of limitations of\nSection 3283 applies to an offense. United States v. Carpenter, 68o F.3d llol, llo3-o4 (9th Cir.\n2ol2) (“We join our sister circuits in looking to subsection 35o9(a) for a definition of ‘sexual\nabuse’ under federal law, and find it the appropriate definition to use in applying section 3283’s\nextended statute of limitations.”); United States v.

May 8, 2ol4) (applying the definition of “sexual abuse” set forth in\nSection 35o9(a)).\n\nAs is evident from its plain text, the definition of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a)\nincludes not only actual “sexual contact,” but also the “the employment, use, persuasion,\ninducement, enticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in,”\nsexual contact. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a). The breadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes.” The Supreme Court has held that Congress’s choice of the word\n“includes” is “significant because it “makes clear that the examples enumerated in the text are\nintended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.” <span class=\"highlight\">Christopher</span> v.

NACDL, What Are They\nThinking?, htps://www.nacdl.org/Event/2o22-Midwinter-Meeting (program description). Even\nprosecutors agree that “[t]raditional voir dire questions... might not sufficiently address potential\njurors’ emotional reactions to sexual assault cases,” and advocate more probative voir dire.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christopher</span> Mallios & Toolsi Meisner, Educating Juries In Sexual Assault Cases, Strategies at 2\n(2olo), htp://www.ncdsv.org/images/AEquitas EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPartl_7-\n2olo.pdf. The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand impartial jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law enforcement,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from prospective jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand. In this case, Juror No. 5o gave untrue answers about\nthe fundamental issue of whether he himself had been victimized by sexual abuse and could be\nfair and impartial ina sexual abuse case. The parties and the Court relied on the accuracy of his\nanswers in allouing him to sit on the jury. Nou that he has exposed his real experiences and\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9lo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl2\nnotwithstanding these prejudices he is determined to listen to the evidence, and be governed by it;\nbut the law will not trust him.” Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 5o. Such a juror “may declare that he feels no\nprejudice in the case; and yet the law cautiously incapacitates him from serving on the jury because\nit suspects prejudice, because in general persons in a similar situation would feel prejudice.” Jd.\n\nIn addition to these situations in which bias must be implied, there are situations where\nbias may be inferred. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of\npartiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror\nfor cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s media statements establish both implied and inferred bias. The average\nperson who was sexually victimized and had Juror 5o’s feelings about the crime and those who\ncomplain about it could not be fair, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. To borrou\nChief Justice Marshall’s phrase, Juror 5o should have been “cautiously incapacitate[d]” from\nserving on this jury.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court should not allou any juror to thwart its screening process by giving inaccurate\nanswers and thereby create such a grave potential, realized in this case, for depriving the defendant\nof her right to a fair trial. A new trial is required.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Abbe David Louell\nAbbe David Louell (SDNY # AL298/) Joel B. Rudin (SDNY # JR5645)\n<span class=\"highlight\">Christopher</span> D.

United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3\n(2oo8)). And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined. Given this expansive language,\nsexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set\nof behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl97 (8d Cir. 2ol5). Thus, courts throughout the coun-\ntry have concluded that Section 3283 applies to a vari-\nety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-\ntween a defendant and a specific child,” United States\nv. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA), 2ol4 WL l838255, at\n*ll (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), or “physical contact with\nthe victim,” Carpenter, 68o F.3d at llo3; accord\nUnited States v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4, 72o (5th Cir.\n2ol5).\n\nSection 3283’s definition thus captures crimes of in-\ntent where a perpetrator seeks to have a minor engage\nin sexual contact even if such sexual contact does not\noccur. Transportation of a minor with intent to engage\nin an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and\nconspiracy to commit the same (as charged in Count\nThree) fall comfortably within that definition. Even\nthough a completed sex act is not required to commit\nthose two crimes, Count Four has “sexual abuse” as an\nelement because it requires the defendant to\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022781.jpg": "Page 238\n\nl not -- it's not as good as I would like it to be.\n2 And I just want to say that.\n3 TODD BLANCHE: Do you -- you mentioned, I\n4 think, yesterday in passing -- well, not in passing,\n5 but as part of another answer, Andrew Cuomo.\n6 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.\n7 TODD BLANCHE: Did you knou Mr. Cuomo?\n8 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well, only because he\n9 was married to Kerry.\nlo TODD BLANCHE: Yes.
