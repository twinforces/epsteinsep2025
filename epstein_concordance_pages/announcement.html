Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">announcement</span> of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which Black\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted.

Shortly after counsel’s\nappearance on behalf of Ms. Maxwell on March 4, 2o2o, BSF served on Ms. Maxwell a Notice\nof Deposition for April 29, 2o2o, without ever having conferred with counsel for available dates.\nLater, BSF amended their notice of deposition to May l8, or offered dates of May 2l, 26, 27 and\n28\" (and demanded an in-person deposition despite the raging COVID pandemic in New York).\nMs. Maxwell filed a Leter Motion on May l3, 2o2o, requesting a stay of discovery in the case\ndue, in part, to the U.S. Atorney’s Southern District of New York’s announcements of its\n“ongoing” criminal investigation into alleged Epstein “co-conspirators,” presumed to include\nMs. Maxwell. /d., Dkt. 68. In his response opposing the stay of discovery, Mr. Boies represented\nto the court that “Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Mr. Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation.” /d., Dkt. 72.

If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor.

Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance.

Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\n<span class=\"highlight\">announcement</span> that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony.

When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public <span class=\"highlight\">announcement</span> of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process.

SDNY’s focus was always on righting the wrongs resulting from\nthe Florida prosecution: Epstein was undercharged and under punished, Epstein never faced his\naccusers, and his accusers were denied justice. Epstein was the target and the focus of the\nprosecution until his death in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) in August 2ol9.\nEpstein’s 2ol9 Arrest and Aftermath\n\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in connection with an SDNY indictment. He\nwas detained in the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) until his untimely death in custody\non August l9, 2ol9. The highly publicized <span class=\"highlight\">announcement</span> of his arrest and detention came as a\nrelief and vindication for women who had filed complaints against him. His capture and\nconfinement quelled public outrage at Epstein’s lenient Florida plea deal from October 2oo7 and\nthe lou sentence he received. Epstein’s death approximately one month after his arrest eliminated\nany prospect ofa trial, again shocking and disappointing his accusers. It also highlighted the failure\nof the U.S. government to ensure that an inmate in federal custody, in such a sensitive and high-\nprofile case, could be kept safe and alive to face trial.\n\nIn the face of strong media and public uproar follouing Epstein’s death, the government\nfaced an urgency to appease the renewed distress of Epstein’s accusers and to repair the tarnished\nreputations of the DOJ and BOP in whose custody Epstein died. There would be no trial for\nEpstein and no public vindication and justice for his accusers. The government nou had a huge\nhole to fill: Epstein’s empty chair.

Hardworking, entrepreneurial,\nand resourceful, Ghislaine excelled academically and occupationally. Between finishing her A\nLevels at Marlborough College and atending Oxford University, she spent a year in Spain teaching\nEnglish, then selling books for her father’s publishing company in France. She began her first\nromance, only to have the relationship quashed by her father’s disapproval of her engagement. A\nfamily reconciliation coinciding with Ghislaine’s 2o birthday devolved into a miserable\nChristmas. Mr. Maxwell was at his absolute worst, making Ghislaine the scapegoat du jour. The\nholiday ended with an <span class=\"highlight\">announcement</span> that her parents were separating.\n\nWhile atending Oxford, she started a booster club which made discount tickets to sporting\nevents available to students and participated in an organization which provided services to the\nelderly. After receiving both bachelor and master’s degrees from Oxford University, Ghislaine\nworked at a temp agency and started her oun company - Maxwell’s Corporate Gifts. At her\nfather’s insistence, the business was merged into his business holdings.
