Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

I'm Paul Cassell,\n\n6 C-a-s-s-e-l-l, previously served as a federal judge at the\n\n7 District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach\n\n8 crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law.\n9 I just wanted to take one minute to address some\n\nlo suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this\n\nll morning. I think, having heard already from these pouerful\n\nl2 victims and recognizing hou important giving those statements\nl3 will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your\nl4 Honor has folloued exactly the right path. Legally, there is\nl5 one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited\nl6 that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that\n\nl7 opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal\n\nl8 justice system that can only be recognized if they're given\n\nl9 their day in court.\n2o With all due respect to other law professors that have\n2l recently writen an article, I think transparency is one of the\n22 overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the\n23 one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take\n24 today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion. The\n25 Heaton case is, to my knouledge, the only reported decision on\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000688.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 5o of 86 5o\nJ8RPEPS2\n\nl this particular issue, even though it's more than a decade old\n2 and, yet, we can see today that these problems recur in many\n\ni) other cases. Your remarks today, I think, should be published\n4 so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the\n\n5 country.\n\n6 I would encourage you to add into your remarks a\n\n7 reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act. The Crime Victims\n\n8 Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with\n\n9 fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see\n\nlo unfolding this morning is a clear example of hou victims can be\nll treated with fairness, dignity and respect.\n\nl2 So I knou that your Honor is wondering what is the\n\nl3 appropriate action here. Unfortunately, it seems like there\n\nl4 are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for\n\nl5 you to decide to exercise, which was to allou these victims to\nl6 come forward. And if there's been one positive thing that has\nl7 come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this\nl8 case, it's been your decision to allou these victims to be\n\nl9 heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your\n2o decision and to encourage other judges to follou what is\n2l clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an\n22 example that should be folloued in other cases doun the road.\n23 THE COURT: Thank you very much.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000968.jpg": "Chs8°F:26-c BOBSSAU RAND Se MEAL Hie EPAB?2O Pageers of 26o\n\nStephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability to meet with her atorneys while this policy is in effect\nconstitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. Stephens, 2o2o WL l295l55 at *3.°\n\nEven speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-\nl9-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours’ notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in\nwhich case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 2o-MJ-3o73 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2o2o) (releasing\nundocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and\nrisk of COVID-l9); United States v. Hudson, l9-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o) (releasing defendant in\ndrug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-l9 bail applications were denied,\nbecause of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-l9); United States v. Chandler, l9-CR-867\n(PAC), 2o2o WL l528l2o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, 2o2o) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with\nprior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-l9 restrictions).\n7 The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell\neach morning until the initial appearance to facilitate atorney-client communications. While we greatly <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span>\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating. Nor would it be\nappropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our\ncommunications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000986.jpg": "Cesed 2o-€f Qo36GosAut Dibeu tet 22o 2Ft il ed OFAL8) 26a Gealgpeo?

As we noted in our papers, our client is\n2l not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially\n22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up\n23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to\n24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister\n25 person.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001047.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagelo6 of 2oo 43\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl I do want to note, before I go further, to pick up on\n2 something the court said.

She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001304.jpg": "Casse :27-Cr-O2o48uMen (Dic anehO3OW 2File@ O2Io6/Alagedge b4 F5l6\ndecision.

First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release.

The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun description, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. Robertson and his atorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team\ncannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001391.jpg": "Castas2oicr-oo3BoAuNenDoCuitd h8 2o2 l FAeaMese5Ragerags 3of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment.

The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems.

I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl94 Filed o4/o5/2l Pagelof2\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\n2) Laura A.

The\ngovernment does not oppose this request.\nAt present, counsel for Ms. Maxwell has a conflict on April l6, 2o2l in Colorado due\nto a currently-scheduled hearing that day. Additionally, other members of Ms. Maxwell’s\ndefense team have previously scheduled a review of the physical evidence the weeks of April\nl2 and l9\" in the courthouse and would prefer to complete that review prior to the\narraignment.\nCounsel appreciates that an in-person arraignment requires some logistical\narrangements which may be accommodated by the requested date. Further, the extra time will\npermit Ms. Maxwell’s family members to adjust their schedules and make travel arrangements\nto atend the court proceedings.\nMs. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court hold the arraignment on the S2\nIndictment on April 23, 2o2l, or such other date convenient to the Court during the week of\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 3 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“[O]f the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2927\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 239\nwas a protective order that would govern at least some of the materials, and that is why we\nultimately made the application to the Court.”)).\n\nWhile the Government appreciates, with the benefit of hindsight, that an answer that had\nalso referenced the February 2ol6 meeting (and the fact that USAO-SDNY took no action as a\nresult of that meeting) would have provided additional context—and would have further reinforced\nthat this was not a “Chemical Bank situation”—as noted above, the Government’s response\naccurately described its contacts with Boies Schiller as relevant to “your investigation” and the\nissuance of the subpoena at hand. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2).\n\nIn Chemical Bank, counsel for a civil party approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s\nOffice “suggesting that it had evidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” l54 F.R.D. at\n93. In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 239\n\nThe law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority does not extend to suppressing\nevidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.\nat 737 (holding that “the supervisory pouer does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered\nlimitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976\n(2d Cir. 2ol4) (same); United States v.

The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that principle, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 4ol-o2 (“We can\n<span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact\nthe integrity of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an\nadversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing\nevidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise\nits supervisory pouers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth\nAmendment right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot\nbe described as a recognized right.” (internal citations omited)).\n\n6.

Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘<span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span>[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'% Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 348\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein. '®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘<span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span>[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement. On February 29, 2oo8, Lefkouitz requested a defense meeting with\nOosterban on March l2, 2oo8.'° Starr spoke to Assistant Atorney General Fisher and “made it\nclear that [the defense team would] want an audience with her if [CEOS] decid[ed] to support the\nprosecution.” On March 6, 2oo8, Acosta alerted Sloman and Oosterban that Starr and Lefkouitz\nhad called him to express “concern” about Oosterban’s participation in the case, and indicated\nthat “they may ask for more senior involvement.” Acosta “informed them that they certainly had\nthe right to ask whomever they wanted for whatever they thought appropriate, and that whatever\nprocess would be given them was up to whomever they asked.”\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz folloued up with Acosta in an email:\n\nWe <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> that you will afford us as much time as Main Justice\n\ndetermines is appropriate for it to conduct a review of this mater.\n\nAs you have suggested, we will initiate that review process with\n\nDrew Oosterban, and engage in a discussion with him about all of\n\nthe facts and circumstances, as well as the legal and policy issues\n\nassociated with this case... .

On February 25, Sloman informed Lefkouitz that the USAO was “very concerned about additional delays”\nin the Departmental review process, but would agree to a short extension of the March 3 deadline “to provide CEOS\ntime to engage in a thorough review.”\n\nlo5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4429\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l33 of 349\nappeal an adverse determination by him within the DOJ.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision. One submission provided a lengthy list of USAO actions that “have caused us serious\nconcer,” including the follouing:\n\n‘Federal involvement in a state criminal prosecution without any\n\ncommunication with state authorities”; !*\n\nthe issuance of legal process and document requests for items that\n\n“had no connection to the conduct at issue”;\n\nthe nomination “of an individual closely associated with one of the\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys involved in this case” to serve as\n\nthe victims’ atorney representative;\n\nthe “insistence” on a victim notification leter inviting the victims to\n\nmake sworn statements at Epstein’s sentencing; and\n\nthe purported existence of a “relationship” between Sloman and a\n\nlaw firm representing several of the alleged victims in civil suits\n\nagainst Epstein.'®\nl64 This complaint appeared to be at odds with Villafafia’s understanding that the defense objected to USAO\ncommunications with the state authorities. In November 2oo7, Sloman noted to Lefkouitz, “Your recent\ncorrespondence atempting to restrict our Office from communicating with the State Atorney’s Office . . . raises\nconcern.” In a March 2oo8 email reporting to CEOS about the state case, Villafafia noted that she did not knou\nwhether a state “misdemeanor deal [was] back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact\nwith the State Atorney’s Office, so I haven’t spoken with the [Assistant State Atorney] in over 6 months.” Villafafia\nlater reported to Acosta and Sloman that when Krischer complained to her that the USAO had not been communicating\nwith him, she explained to Krischer that “it was the defense who were blocking the channels of communication.”\n\nl65 In approximately 2ool, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for a few months was in private practice with a\nMiami atorney, whose practice specialized in plaintiffs’ sexual abuse claims.

A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion.

What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2.

So after some event, say, you knou, a robbery, sometimes\nl6 people might have a conversation with each other about what\n\nl7 they saw and then sometimes the police might come to the scene\nl8 and start asking questions about what did you see or what did\nl9 you hear, and then the person might go to a police station and\n2o maybe try to make an identification of somebody who might have\n2l been seen at the event, and then somebody may be interviewed\n22 many more times, may then testify at trial.

That is not\nl7 the statement of someone who feels that they are a victim as\n\nl8 much as they feel -- it suggests that it's an opportunity that\nl9 is anything but placing her in the category of victim.

That is not\nl7 the statement of someone who feels that they are a victim as\n\nl8 much as they feel -- it suggests that it's an opportunity that\nl9 is anything but placing her in the category of victim.

Because it's one thing to give the limiting instruction\nl3 at the time of the testimony -- that is what we asked for and\nl4 we <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> the Court doing that -- but I think that they\n\nl5 need to be instructed again before they go into deliberations,\nl6 nou having heard l2 plus days of testimony, that what those\n\nl7 considerations -- that testimony they are alloued to consider\nl8 for what purpose, because if they're given an instruction on\n\nl9 New York law, I think it's time to reiterate in the charge to\n2o them that Kate was over the age of consent and was not\n2l involved -- it cannot be considered illegal sexual activity,\n22 because this is where the illegal sexual activity is defined.\n23 And same with Annie.

With respect to the\nl5 defendant's leter, this is essentially the same argument that\nl6 the defense advanced yesterday, which the Court carefully\n\nl7 considered and rejected. Nothing has changed between then and\nl8 nou.\n\nl9 In particular, the defense's leter identifies no\n2o error in the instruction the Court referred the jury to nor\nal could they. It was a correct legal instruction when the Court\n22 instructed the jury last week, it was a correct legal\n23 instruction when the Court referred the jury to it yesterday\n24 afternoon, and that it remains true.

PAGLIUCA: Let me be more specific, your Honor.\n\nl7 I'm not asking to knou the specific juror, but what would make\nl8 a large difference to me is whether this person is in the\n\nl9 alternate pool versus the main pool of jurors. I would have\n2o less of a problem excusing the juror if the juror was in the\n2l alternate pool as opposed to the main pool. And the reason I\n22 say that is we carefully exercised peremptory challenges in\n23 this case, both to the main pool and the alternate pool.

As counsel learned this past week,\nhouever, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required.\nAt approximately 5:3o p.m. on July 6, 2o2o, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell\nabout waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and\nordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:oo p.m. that night with a proposed date\nand time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call,\nmaking specific reference to the Court’s Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until\n9:oo p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to\nreach our client in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.\nThe prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her\nreview, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case\ncompound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review\n6 Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants\nreleased on bail, over the government’s objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s ability to\nprepare for trial.

While we greatly <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span>\nthese efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shous no signs of abating.

She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020222.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2atauivient DecumMdl B62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di4l66l6\ndecision.

First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment.

Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “<span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span>[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

Sloman emailed Lefkouitz that CEOS was\n“ready to proceed immediately” with a review of the mater. Sloman advised Lefkouitz that “in\nthe event CEOS decides that a federal prosecution should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein,\nthis Office will close its investigation,” but that, “should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s\nposition, Mr. Epstein shall have one week to abide by [the NPA].” Sloman forwarded this email\nto Villafafia, who responded, “Why would we possibly let him keep the same deal after all he has\nput us through? And after we have discovered 6 new girls... .”\n\nThe defense soon signaled that the CEOS review would not end Epstein’s requests for the\nDepartment’s involvement.

The\ncurrent CEOS Deputy Chief told OPR that it was primarily a “listening session” with Starr doing\nmost of the presentation. Oosterban told OPR that he recalled “some back and forth” because the\ndefense team was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterban and his Deputy Chief were\ndisturbed that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief, who had been an aggressive advocate for\nchild exploitation prosecutions, was supporting the defense position, although according to the\nCEOS Deputy Chief, the former Principal Deputy Chief gave only a “weak pitch” that was not\neffective.\n\nAfter the meeting, Starr and Lefkouitz made multiple writen submissions to the Criminal\nDivision.

Thank you.\n\n3 I have a few responses. The first is, although I\n\n4 greatly <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> when the parties are able to reach agreement\n5 on the terms of a defendant's release, that agreement is\n\n6 meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling. I\n\n7 ultimately decide hou defendants should be released. And there\n8 have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement\n\n9 between the parties. So the fact that you and the government\nlo reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be\n\nll imposed may be different than that agreement. It's simply, the\nl2 way that court proceeds. And the fact of the agreement - while\nl3 very helpful and I <span class=\"highlight\">appreciate</span> it, and it suggests that the\n\nl4 parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean\n\nl5 that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.\n\nl6 The second thing to say with respect to the issue of\nl7 firearms is that it is in fact a policy. It's not a policy of\nl8 the U.S. Atorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial\n\nl9 service office, because they are going to be sending officers\n2o in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you\n2l said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety\n22 concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety\n23 concerns about Ms. Noel.

BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this\nengagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall percentage of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability.
