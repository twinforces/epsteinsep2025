See United States v. Boustani, 356 F.

United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v.

See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v.

And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to the government’s December 4, 2o2l leter—the latest example of\nthe government’s inability to take no for an answer. This is the government’s modus operandi. It\ndisagrees with the Court’s ruling and seeks to relitigate the issue under the guise of uncertainty\n(either the government claims not to understand, or the Court wasn’t clear enough) or confusion\n(the Court didn’t understand the government’s argument). But there isn’t any uncertainty or\nconfusion here. The government has, so far, failed to authenticate the 9oo series photos, and\nunless it does, the photos are irrelevant under Rule 4ol and misleading and prejudicial under\nRule 4o3. This Court should reaffirm its ruling from December 3.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe 9oo series of photos depict the exterior and portions of the interior of Mr. Epstein’s\nNew York <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> as it existed in 2ol9. That much the government can shou.\n\nBut the government has admited no testimony that the 2ol9 photographs accurately\ndepict the interior of Mr. Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996 (when Jane\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8225", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525 Filed l2/o5/2l Page2of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Without\ntestimony from a witness that the interior photos accurately reflect the inside of Mr. Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> as it existed during the charged conspiracy, they are not admissible.!\nJane alleges that she visited Mr. Epstein’s New York <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> when she was l4 or l5 or\nl6 years old (l994 or l995 or l996), TR ll/2o/2o2l, p 3l6-l7, and that he assaulted her in the\nmassage room, id. at 32o:l2-l4. Although the government never shoued Jane the 9oo series\nphotos during her testimony, the government nou says the photos (taken 2ol9, fifteen years after\nany conspiracy ended) corroborate what Jane claims to have seen inside Mr. Epstein’s house\ntwenty-five years earlier. Gov. Leter at 3.\nThe government relies only on Jane’s testimony, pointing to pages 3l7-32o of the\ntranscript. With the exception of the massage room, here was what Jane said about the inside of\nthe house:\ne The <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> was more like a building than a house; it had eight stories. TR\nll/2o/2o2l, p 3l7:l6-22.\n\n® Inside, it was “very dark,” “very, very -- like an old building.” /d. at 3l7:24-25.\n\ne It had “fabric wallpaper, like red curtains, lots of artwork, statues, paintings.” /d.\nat 3l8:l-2.\n\ne The artwork was “a litle creepy personally,” with a “dark theme,” “intimidating”\nwith “animal heads and strange things.” /d. at 3l8:5-l3.\n\ne The artwork included “[p]aintings of naked women and orgies and things like\nthat.” Jd. at 3l8:l8.\n\n' As counsel stated on Friday, Ms. Maxwell does not object to the exterior photographs.\nTR l2/3/2o2l, p 932:l7-2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8226", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008228.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page4of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nThe Court was exactly right.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe government, “as the proponent of this evidence, bears the burden of shouing that the\nevidence is admissible.” Pinero v. Burbran, No. l8-CV-4698 (AJN), 2o2l WL 4224727, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. l6, 2o2l) (quotation omited). In turn, under Rule 9ol(a), “To satisfy the\nrequirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce\nevidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol(a). If authenticated, the proponent of the evidence must also prove that the evidence is\nrelevant and not unfairly prejudicial or misleading. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2, 4o3.\n\n“A picture may .. . be inadmissible, although technically accurate, because it portrays a\nscene that is materially different from a scene that is relevant to one of the issues at trial.” United\nStates v. Stearns, 55o F.2d ll67, ll7o (9th Cir. l977). And when a “photograph fails to portray\nthe relevant facts with complete accuracy, such as if changed conditions have occurred, it may be\nmisleading.” § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th ed.).’\n\nThe government has not met its burden of proof here. The charged conspiracy ended in\n2oo4. And Jane claims she was at Mr. Epstein’s New York <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in l994 or l995 or l996.\n\n* The government relies on just two cases to support its argument: United States v.\nCertified Env. Services, Inc., 753 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2ol4) and United States v. Roux, 7l5 F.3d\nlol9 (7th Cir. 2ol3). Gov. Leter at 2. Neither case addresses photographs of real or personal\nproperty, and neither responds to this Court’s concerns about the passage of time and changed\ncircumstances.\n\nCertified Environmental Services dealt with emails and Code Rule guidance, 753 F.3d at\n89-9l, and Roux addressed other act evidence, 7l5 F.3d at lo27. Both cases addressed evidence\nrelevant to the defendant’s state of mind. Most importantly, the existence of the evidence is what\nmade it relevant, and no one disputed authentication. The cases have no relevance here.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page5of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 5\nThe photographs at issue were taken in 2ol9, twenty-five years after Jane was purportedly at the\nhouse and fifteen years after any alleged conspiracy ended.\n\nAlthough the government can shou that the photos accurately reflect Mr. Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> as it existed in 2ol9, no witness has testified that the photos accurately depict the\nhome as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or even that the photos depict items similar to what\nJane claims to have seen a quarter of a century ago. The government, therefore, has not\nauthenticated the photos, and the evidence is irrelevant and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\n\nThe government devotes six pages of its leter to the 2ol9 photos of the massage room.\nGov. Leter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o. The\ngovernment claims the 2ol9 photos are independently corroborative of Jane’s testimony because\nthey shou that her description of Mr. Epstein’s house as it existed in l994 and l995 and l996\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8229", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008230.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page 6of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 6\nwas accurate. Gov. Leter at 8. But that argument would work only if there were evidence that\nthe 2ol9 photos look like what photos from l994 or l995 or l996 would have looked like. And\nas the government does not deny, there’s no such evidence.\n\nThe government does not dispute that it could have asked Jane to authenticate the photos\nby shouing the photographs to her when she testified. Gov. Leter at 8 n.3. According to the\ngovernment, houever, “[b]efore shouing the photographs to Jane on the stand, the Government\nwould surely need to shou her the photographs in advance,” and that would have “‘vitiat[ed] the\nphotographs’ value as independent corroboration.” /d. This is a baseless argument.\n\nThe government easily could have shoued the photographs to Jane for the first time\nduring her testimony, asked her if she recognized them, asked whether the photos accurately\ndepicted the house and massage room as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or at least asked if\nthe photographs looked similar to what the <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> looked like back then. In turn, once the\ngovernment elicited testimony from another witness about when the photographs were taken, it\ncould have moved to admit them. This procedure would have addressed the government’s\nconcer about preserving the photographs as independent corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The\nonly conceivable thing stopping the government from doing this was a concern that Jane would\nnot give the answer the government wanted.\n\nBut even if this procedure would have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration,” that’s just hou trials go. Sometimes tradeoffs are necessary to comply with the\nrules of evidence. And having to make such a tradeoff does not mean Ms. Maxwell was wrong to\nobject or the Court was wrong to sustain.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo823o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page 8of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 8\n\nThe government’s leter next addresses photos of vibrators and a stuffed tiger. As for the\nvibrators, the government does not contend the vibrators are the “particular vibrators used on\nJane,” only that they are “they type” of vibrators used on Jane. Gov. Leter at lo. But there is no\ntestimony to support that argument, because Jane did not describe the vibrators other than to say\nthey were “different sizes.” TR ll/2o/2o2l, p 3lo:l4-l5.3 And because the government did not\nshou these photos to Jane, there is no evidence that they are “the type” she claims Mr. Epstein\nused on her. If they were “the type,” Jane could easily have said so on the stand.\n\nThe tiger next. Jane testified that Mr. Epstein had “animals” and “animal heads” and\n“strange things” in the house that were “a litle creepy personally.” /d. at 3l8:5-l3. She did not\ntestify or describe a tiger. There’s no foundation to admit that photograph, or the photograph of a\nstuffed dog, which Jane also did not describe. Gov. Leter at ll.4\n\nThe government also discusses six photos that shou the so-called structural features of\nthe house. Again, Ms. Maxwell does not challenge photos of the outside of Mr. Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span>. But photos of the inside of the <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> are a different mater. The government has\nnot authenticated them, and even if they were authenticated, they have minimal if any probative\nvalue, as contrasted with their potential to mislead the jury as to what the <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> looked like\n\n3 Mr. Alessi’s testimony about back massagers in Palm Beach has no bearing on the\nvibrators found in New York twenty years later.

Leter at 9.\n\n* Stuffed animals and vibrators are also highly mobile.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8232", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page9of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “massage.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in Paris, and his\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at\nthe time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this mater\nand avoiding the trauma of testifying again.

No. 574).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo542", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 675-3 Filed o6/25/22 Page3of5\nthe vocabulary to describe them. In the most literal sense of the word, Epstein and Maxwell terrified\nme. They told me that if I told anyone, nobody would believe me and if they did, they would kill me\nand the people closest to me. I believed them. I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved life\nand people genuinely enjoyed being around me. After meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\nit felt like someone shut off the lights to my soul.\n\nMy secrets became too much for me to handle, and I began doing whatever I could to try to\nget away from Maxwell and Epstein. I changed jobs, apartments, cities and even states to try to get\naway. Everywhere I went, they found me. In l997, I moved to Philadelphia with the hopes of finally\nstarting law school. They found me again and it was more than I could take. I was hospitalized with a\nnervous breakdoun. It would be the first of over two dozen hospitalizations in the decades follouing\nmy involvement with Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn addition to my escalating mental health problems, I began to experience physical symptoms\nthat doctors could never quite put their finger on.

United States v.

The exhibits could\n2l corroborate several aspects of Jane's testimony, including that\n22 the room was the size of a giant walk-in closet, but space for\n23 a giant massage table in the middle of it.

In short, these photos have\n2 litle, if any, relevance and they're likely prejudicial\n\n3 because they are likely to confuse the jury.\n\n4 The four sets of photos that the government seeks to\n\na admit, photos 936 and 938, depict a room with a stuffed tiger\n\n6 and a stuffed dog. The government argues that these photos\n\n7 corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span>\n\n8 contained, quote, creepy-looking animals and animal heads and\n\n9 strange things.

Second, though Jane described\nl4 artwork of animals, she did not describe a stuffed dog or\n\nl5 tiger. The photos therefore have litle corroborative value,\nl6 even if, as the government argues, the dog and tiger are highly\nl7 idiosyncratic. And the photos are unfairly prejudicial because\nl8 they're likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that these\n\nl9 same items were in Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> at the time that Jane\n2o was there. Further, the idiosyncratic nature of the items is\n2l likely to distract the jury, it could delay trial as the\n22 connection to Jane's testimony is tenuous at best.\n23 T'll note that, as I've said, the schoolgirl outfits\n24 found in the New York <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in 2ol9 that the government\n25 intends to introduce, as I said on Friday, I anticipate these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2763", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel3 of 26l ll53\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl would be admissible if the witness connects these outfits to\n\n2 the applicable timeframe by testifying that they're similar to\n3 the outfits she was allegedly instructed to wear.\n\n4 Last, the government references photos taken in\n\na Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> that depict photos of celebrities.

Rule 9ol requires that the proponent must\n5 produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item\n6 is what the proponent claims it is. Here, the government\n\n7 claims that the photographs are of Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in 2ol9,\n8 a claim that I understand will be provided via testimony and\n\n9 that the defense does not dispute. Whether those photos taken\nlo in 2ol9 are probative of hou the <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> appeared in l994 is\nll a question of relevance under Rule 4ol to be balanced with 4o3,\nl2 not of authentication.

United States v.

The exhibits could\n2l corroborate several aspects of Jane's testimony, including that\n22 the room was the size of a giant walk-in closet, but space for\n23 a giant massage table in the middle of it. Trial transcript at\n24 32o x\n25 She also described it as very dark and with a red mood\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l2 of 26l ll52\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl massagers to which Jane testified. In short, these photos have\n2 litle, if any, relevance and they're likely prejudicial\n\n3 because they are likely to confuse the jury.\n\n4 The four sets of photos that the government seeks to\n\na admit, photos 936 and 938, depict a room with a stuffed tiger\n\n6 and a stuffed dog. The government argues that these photos\n\n7 corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span>\n\n8 contained, quote, creepy-looking animals and animal heads and\n\n9 strange things. Trial transcript at 3o5 to 3l8.\n\nlo I will exclude these photos, first, both the dog and\nll tiger are moveable items such that the photos taken in 2ol9\n\nl2 are, without additional testimony, not probative of what Jane\nl3 would have seen years earlier. Second, though Jane described\nl4 artwork of animals, she did not describe a stuffed dog or\n\nl5 tiger. The photos therefore have litle corroborative value,\nl6 even if, as the government argues, the dog and tiger are highly\nl7 idiosyncratic. And the photos are unfairly prejudicial because\nl8 they're likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that these\n\nl9 same items were in Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> at the time that Jane\n2o was there. Further, the idiosyncratic nature of the items is\n2l likely to distract the jury, it could delay trial as the\n22 connection to Jane's testimony is tenuous at best.\n23 T'll note that, as I've said, the schoolgirl outfits\n24 found in the New York <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in 2ol9 that the government\n25 intends to introduce, as I said on Friday, I anticipate these\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Pagel3 of 26l ll53\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl would be admissible if the witness connects these outfits to\n\n2 the applicable timeframe by testifying that they're similar to\n3 the outfits she was allegedly instructed to wear.\n\n4 Last, the government references photos taken in\n\na Epstein's <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> that depict photos of celebrities.

Maxwell and Epstein spent\ntime together in Epstein’s various properties, includ-\ning his mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhatan,\nhis villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his\n<span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in Paris, and his private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands. (Tr.99). Maxwell also received a toun-\nhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York City,\nand Epstein transferred more than $23 million to Max-\nwell during the timeframe of the conspiracy. (Tr.ll94,\nl3lo-l7).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, Max-\nwell also supervised Epstein’s households as “the lady\nof the house.” (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of\nEpstein’s homes, she imposed strict rules for staff,\nsome of which were included in a household manual\ndictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence.\n(Tr.8o7-o8, 823-3l).\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure,\nMaxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s\nhomes. (Tr.784, 826). The household manual made\nclear that staff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say\nnothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (Tr.826). Maxwell directed Juan Alessi,\nthe former manager of Epstein’s Palm Beach villa, to\nspeak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look\nEpstein in the eyes.

Epstein's home in New York City was reided by law enforcement as\nwell, and investigators found nude photographs of underage girls, thousands of dollars in\ncash, dozens of loose diamonds, and a foreign passport from the l98os with Epstein's picture\nand a false name.\nEpstein's lawyers had argued that Epstein should be alloued out on house arrest, asking the\ncourt to let him await trial in his Manhatan mansion. That request was denied. Besides his\nNew York City mansion, Epstein also had an estate in Palm Beach, maintained a ranch in New\nMexico, had a luxury <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in Paris, and ouned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nIn denying him bail earlier this month, the judge said\nthat Epstein posed a “significant” danger to the\ncommunity and agreed with prosecutors that he was\na serious flight risk.\n:\nhitps:/Avwaw.washIngtonexaminer.com/news/barr-announces-doj-Inspector-general_investigation-intc-epstein-death a3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022404.jpg": "Page l2\nl TODD BLANCHE: So -- okay.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst.

A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid\n\"Bright Young Things,\" writen by one of their oun, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this croud as a bunch of\ntwits living off their trust funds.\nGhislaine's oun funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the\ncrash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to oun an <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> on the\nUpper East Side and a mews house in London.\nShe is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly\nhas holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of atractive young women, and it's\nsaid that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.\nGhislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be\nheavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing\nwere diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going doun the toilet.\n\nReproduced with permission of the copyright ouner.

The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033226.jpg": "When it became clear, houever, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not\ninclude staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no\nfuture as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three\nchildren. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly\nevery day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so\nin the 26 years they have knoun each other. She described their current relationship as\nfollous:\n\nToday [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is\nthe godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as\nwell. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the\nevening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and\nconduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the\nchildren’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational\ngames for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey\nwas extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could\nnot ask for a beter friend or godfather to my children.\n. Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, l2. Celina wrote\nglouingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time\n: from his personal and business schedule to go over to her <span class=\"highlight\">apartment</span> and discuss science\nand mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for\nexample, as why the sky is blue or hou fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they\nthen spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing\nvoice (even though, as she knous, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this\narea). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, houever, by an\nincident Celina related in her leter:\nOne of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2\nyears ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter\ndance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I\ndidn’t knou what I would do because you had to bring your father to the\ndance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone\ncall to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than lo\nminutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he\nrushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.\n\nAfter Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey\nentered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning\n6\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33226"};
