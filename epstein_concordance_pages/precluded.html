As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 23\nhad in the Chemical Bank case.

Because\nof the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard\npractice under such circumstances, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel\nthat it had issued the subpoenas.\n\nIn response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not\ncovered by the protective orders in the relevant civil cases. Houever, Boies Schiller also had\nadvised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest compliance with the\nsubpoenas, it believed that the protective orders <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> full compliance.» (Exs. 8 & 9).\nAccordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet\nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective\nprotective orders to permit compliance with the subpoenas.

Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’!

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo329o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard <span class=\"highlight\">Precluded</span> Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 348\n\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\n\nhad already been signed that <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> any prosecution of Epstein\n\nfor federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue.

In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

Ms. Maxwell contends only that a\nprovision that immunizes “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” precludes their prosecution for\nconduct allegedly done in conspiracy with Epstetn—conduct that even the United States\nAtorney for this District has characterized as a “prequel” to offenses by Epstein that the NPA\nundisputedly immunizes.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll5 of 349\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard <span class=\"highlight\">Precluded</span> Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004533.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 236 of 349\n\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\n\nhad already been signed that <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> any prosecution of Epstein\n\nfor federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\n\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\ncoordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [professional counseling.

In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . .

Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of54\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\ni The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or Using First\nNames, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits ..o..............ecccecesceeeeeseeeeeeeeereeeeeceeneenenteeeeee 3\nA.

For example, “subject mater [that] is traditionally considered private\nrather than public” will weigh “heavily against access.” Amodeo, 7l F.3d at lo5o.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)).

App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v.

Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F.

We do not intend to violate that rule.\n\nNevertheless, conducting a shoddy investigation is not an “investigative technique.” As\npreviously discussed, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence and argument challenging the\n“thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at\n445; see also id. at 446 (citing Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense\nlawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”)\nand Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42 (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”).\n\nAs the people with the most knouledge of the scope and progress of the investigations,\nthe case agents are the most appropriate witnesses for the defense to call to explore these topics.\nAnd because the government has assiduously avoided calling them in its case-in-chief, the\ndefense must call them in its oun case. It is meritless for the government, at this stage of the\ncase, to try to preclude entire topics or areas of questioning, or to preclude the defense from\ncalling the case agents at all. The Court should not permit this. If particular questions to the\ncase agents are objectionable, those objections can be addressed at trial.\n\nE.

A PRE-TRIAL BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-\n\nTESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY\n\nThe government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at\ntrial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in\norder both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as\nto when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only\nsummary suggestions of what the evidence \"might\" be and then asks the Court to rule\ndefinitively that the defense is <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from challenging that evidence via cross-examination\nor otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a\nnon-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such\na witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.\n\nThe government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates\noffering from others related i\n\nP| It says that \"other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of\nthose two non-testifying witnesses, \"including [unspecified] statements by them,\" which\nstatements according to the government \"will not include any statements ... offered for the truth\nof the mater asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 8o6.\" Mot. at 37-38.\nThe government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the\npertinent statements will be, to wit:\n© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR\ntherefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what\npurpose.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief.

The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 4o\n\nThe defense also argues that they should be permited to elicit information that the Minor\nVictims engaged in voluntary acts, because that may go to the defendant’s knouledge. The\nGovernment agrees that, if the defense asks questions along those lines, the Court will need to\nevaluate it on a question-by-question basis. But questions that are relevant to consent but not the\ndefendant’s mens rea, and any argument to the jury about the Minor Victims’ consent, is irrelevant\nand should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>.\n\nH.

(Def. Opp. at 49-57). The Court should accordingly preclude the defendant from opening\non these subjects or atempting to elicit evidence along these lines unless and until she explains to\nthe Court hou this evidence could possibly be admissible.\n\nAs explained above and in the Government’s motion, houever, there is significant risk that\nthe defense theories will contravene the Federal Rules of Evidence and the law of the Circuit to\nput irrelevant maters, such as the Florida investigation, before the jury.

By Failing to Comply with the Rule 4o4(b) Notice Requirement, the\n\nGovernment Has Waived the Admission of Any Evidence Pursuant to the\n\nRule\n\nUnder the version of Rule 4o4(b) in effect for this trial, the Government was required to\nspecifically \"identify\" any evidence it intends to offer under the Rule, to \"articulate...the\npermited purpose for which\" the identified evidence will be offered, and to state the \"reasoning\nthat supports the purpose.\" The Government did not timely comply with these requirements and\nshould therefore be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from offering any evidence under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nTo be sure, the Rule 4o4(b) Leter did \"identify\" |\n[3 even\nthough the Government claimed ggg may be admissible \"in the alternative, pursuant to\nRule 4o4(b),\" there is nothing in the Leter which states the permited purpose for which they\nmight be offered, nor the \"reasoning that supports that purpose.\" Ms. Maxwell is unable to guess\nwhich of the laundry list of potential purposes contained in Rule 4o4(b) might serve as the\ngrounds, and she certainly is not able to guess the Government's \"reasoning.\" Without the\nrequired notice, both defense counsel and the Court cannot undertake the required analysis to\ndetermine whether the evidence is being offered for a proper non-propensity purpose, is relevant\nto a disputed issue, can satisfy a Rule 4o3 analysis, or needs a limiting instruction. United States\nv. Bui, 859 F. App'x 6lo (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Brand, 467\nF.3d l79, l96 (2d Cir. 2oo6)).\n\nThe Government likewise did \"identify\" JI as a potential witness and offered\ntwo, non-exclusive potential topics of her testimony.

It should therefore be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>\nunder Rule 4o3.\n\nBACKGROUD\nThe government repeatedly and erroneously argued in the context of Ms. Maxwell’s bail\napplications that Ms. Maxwell went into “hiding” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein to avoid\ndetection by law enforcement. See 7/2/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Supp. of Detention (Dkt. oo4) at 8\n(“[Ms. Maxwell] made intentional efforts to avoid detection”); 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in\nSupp. of Detention (Dkt. o22) at 8 (measures that Ms. Maxwell took “to conceal herself” after\nEpstein’s indictment “are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement”); l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s\nRenewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant\nwas hiding not just from the press, but also from law enforcement.”). The government also\nrepeatedly and erroneously argued that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct at the time of her arrest\nevidenced an intent to evade law enforcement. See 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in Supp. of\nDetention (Dkt. o22) at 7-8; 7/l4/2o2o Tr. of Bail Hrg. at 3l:2o-34:5; l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in\nOpp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l-22.\nThe government’s assertion rests on groundless speculation concerning actions which\nMs. Maxwell was forced to take in the days after Epstein’s arrest to protect herself and her\nfamily and friends from unrelenting harassment by the media and the very real danger of\nphysical threats against them. In particular, the government has noted the follouing in its prior\nsubmissions:\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel2oofl4\nand requested a ride away from the murder scene shortly after the crime took place did not\nsupport an inference of guilt).\n\nThe government therefore cannot establish, with any degree of confidence, sufficient\nfacts to satisfy even the first of the Sadawi inferences. Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424 (probative\nvalue of flight evidence as proof of consciousness of guilt “depends upon the degree of\nconfidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (l) from the defendant’s behavior to\nflight....”). Allouing the government to present this evidence to the jury as evidence of “flight”\nwould invite the jury to infer consciousness of guilt based on nothing more than unfounded\nspeculation. That is patently improper and must be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>. /d. (citing Sanchez, 79o F.2d at\n252 (flight evidence “must ... provide the jury with more than an opportunity for mere conjecture\nand speculation.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited))).\n\nFurthermore, admiting evidence of flight would be misleading to the jury and unfairly\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. It would also require the defense to call witnesses to counter the\ngovernment’s evidence and lead to a distracting mini trial on the issue of flight. The prejudice,\nconfusion, and delay caused by admiting this evidence would substantially outweigh any limited\nprobative value it may have. It must therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See Fed. R.

(Ex. A at 3).\n\ne “[G]rooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that there is\nno valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” (/d. at 4\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)).\n\ne “In any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming\nhas occurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of individuals.\nSuch judgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced.”\n\ne “There is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third parties,” and it is not\naccepted in the relevant community. “[I]t has not and cannot be tested; and there is no\nknoun or potential rate of error.”\n\ne The notion that “individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse” is ‘“‘a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is “not\nbased on empirical data.”\n\nAs explained belou, the Government agrees that Dr. Dietz may offer an opinion on the difficulty\nof accurately determining whether an act constitutes grooming, in response to Dr. Rocchio.\nAlthough his remaining opinions purport to respond to Dr. Rocchio, houever, they are themselves\nunreliable or invade the province of the jury, and should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>.\n\nBeyond his response to Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, Dr. Dietz offers several additional\nopinions, to which the Government objects as discussed herein. As to “hindsight bias,” Dr. Dietz\nopines:\n\ne Hindsight bias, or “the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an\n\nevent is after being informed about the outcome of an event,” exists and has been found\nin various experiments. (Ex. A at 4-5).\ne Hindsight bias “affects legal judgments.” (/d. at 5).\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 4l\nProp., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts to act as . .. vehicles for factual\nnarrative”). This “opinion” should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\nassault do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury. There will be no dispute that allegations\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 4l\n\ncan be either true or false, and offering an “expert” opinion that allegations can be false is simply\nprejudicial, not only inviting the jury to speculate about the frequency of false allegations but\ngiving the incorrect impression that they are common. Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l296\n(2d Cir. l99l) (“The weighing of relevance under Rule 4o3 may be altered when a false impression\nis created by earlier testimony. That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily\noutweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admiss[i]ble to rebut testimony\nelicited on cross examination that created a false impression.” (citations omited)).\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 4l\nwidespread or general acceptance, or are otherwise reliable. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 593-95, 592\n&n.lo. Accordingly, unless the defense meets its burden of affirmatively establishing that this\nopinion, as applied to the context of this case, meets the Daubert reliability standard, it should be\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>. See, e.g., P.S. ex rel. Nelson v. The Farm, Inc., 658 F. Supp. 2d l28l, l288 (D. Kan.\n2oo9) (excluding as unreliable an expert’s opinion that children typically report abuse in response\nto direct questioning without holding hearing). Should the defense come forward with some\nevidence of reliability in its response papers, the Government would respectfully request an\nopportunity to reply or, in the alternative, a Daubert hearing to probe the issue.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to the context of this case, the defendant\nhas not established the reliability of these opinions, which should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> or, at a minimum,\nexplored at a hearing. And to the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to other contexts,\nthey are irrelevant.”\n\nI. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED EXPERT TESTIMONY OF\n\nDR. ELIZABETH LOFTUS SHOULD BE <span class=\"highlight\">PRECLUDED</span>\n\nA. Background\n\nThe defense seeks to offer expert opinions of Dr. Loftus on “the workings of human\nmemory.” (Ex. A at l). Specifically, the defense seeks to offer testimony from Dr. Loftus\nregarding:\n\nl. “[H]ou memory fades and weakens over time.”\n\n’ The Government understands that Dr. Dietz is not planning on atending the November lo, 2o2l\nDaubert hearing of Dr. Rocchio, and the Government has not to date received any Rule 26.2\ndisclosures from Dr. Dietz, or even a complete bibliography of the sources cited in his disclosure.\nThe Government respectfully requests that, should a hearing be scheduled on the reliability of Dr.\nDietz’s opinions, that hearing be held after the defense’s response to this motion and after all\nnecessary Rule 26.2 disclosures are made.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo624o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 38 of 4l\nis a tautology that someone who has a false memory—that is, unknouingly misremembers\nsomething—believes it to be accurate. Otherwise it would not be a memory.\n\n3. Opinions Bearing on Witness Credibility and Demeanor\n\nThe follouing opinions by Dr. Loftus invade the province of the jury by atempting to\ninstruct it on hou to assess witness credibility and demeanor:\n\ne Hou an individual with a false memory can describe that memory “with confidence, detail\nand emotion,” as described in Paragraph 5(a) above.\ne Hou an individual with a false memory is “not deliberately lying,” as described in\n\nParagraph 5(b) above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from opining on victim or witness credibility, including by\nopining as to hou a victim with an alleged false memory may testify (e.g., confidently) and\ndescribing a victim with an alleged false memory as a “liar” or “not a deliberate liar.’ Such\nopinions would be highly prejudicial and inflammatory, would confuse and mislead the jury, and\nwould invade the fundamental province of the jury in determining witness credibility. See\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d at 288-89 (affirming district court’s exclusion of expert testimony that a\nwitness’s confidence does not correlate to the witness’s factual accuracy in the context of an\nidentification because such testimony “might confuse or mislead the jury”); Shohola, 2ol9 WL\n6o53223, at *lo-l3 (discussing jury’s province of determining witness credibility); Fed. R. Evid.\n4o3. Such opinions, moreover, are effectively defense arguments to be appropriately made during\ndefense summations. To allou Dr. Loftus to testify that a victim is essentially a liar (but may not\nrealize she is a liar) or that a witness may testify confidently even when testifying untruthfully\nwould effectively allou the defense to cloak its arguments under the imprimatur of a purported\nexpert. The Court will instruct the jury on witness credibility. A defense expert should not provide\na dueling instruction. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (“Even if a jury were not misled into\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4. Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n\ne Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)).

(charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination\nonly “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *l-2 (precluding cross examination of\nagent regarding district atorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).\n\nThe Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are irrelevant,\nhearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\nInvestigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F.

Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 54\n\nv.

Defendants are permited to challenge the motives for a prosecution by seeking\ndismissal of an indictment due to vindictive or selective prosecution. See, e.g., United States v.\nAvenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 558, 562-64, 576 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2o2o) (denying vindictive\nand selective prosecution claims). Such challenges, houever, are issues “for the court rather\nthan for the jury.” United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Regan,\nlo3 F.3d at lo82); see Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b)(3)(A)(iv) (listing, among pretrial motions, “a\ndefect in instituting the prosecution, including . . . selective or vindictive prosecution’’).\nAccordingly, courts have sustained objections or <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> defendants from arguing to the jury\nabout the Government’s motives. See Farhane, 634 F.3d. at l66-67 (affirming a sustained\nobjection to a defense closing argument that “the government had targeted him for prosecution\nbased on his religion”); United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at\n*3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (“[T]o the extent Locust seeks to highlight the fact that he was not a\ntarget of the investigation to suggest that the government’s true targets were the doctors and\nlawyers allegedly involved in the conspiracy and to draw atention to their absence from this\ncase, the Court has already ruled that such argument is improper.”).\n\nThe defense is free to argue that the defendant is not guilty.

Accordingly, evidence or arguments that\nthe victims consented to being trafficked, transported, enticed, or sexually exploited would not\ngive rise to a valid defense, and they should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>. See Elbert, 56l F.3d at 777-78\n(affirming exclusion of evidence of a victim’s consent under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2).

Such evidence is not probative or relevant\nto any issue at the trial. It cannot support a defense, and it does not impeach the witnesses or\nundermine their credibility.\n\nAnd in any event, argument and evidence about victims’ consent should be excluded\nunder Rule 4o3.

The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 69\nparticular “investigative technique” to prepare its case.

We do not intend to violate that rule.\n\nNevertheless, conducting a shoddy investigation is not an “investigative technique.” As\npreviously discussed, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence and argument challenging the\n“thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at\n445; see also id. at 446 (citing Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense\nlawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”)\nand Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42 (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”).\n\nAs the people with the most knouledge of the scope and progress of the investigations,\nthe case agents are the most appropriate witnesses for the defense to call to explore these topics.\nAnd because the government has assiduously avoided calling them in its case-in-chief, the\ndefense must call them in its oun case. It is meritless for the government, at this stage of the\ncase, to try to preclude entire topics or areas of questioning, or to preclude the defense from\ncalling the case agents at all. The Court should not permit this. If particular questions to the\ncase agents are objectionable, those objections can be addressed at trial.\n\nE.

A PRE-TRIAL BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-\n\nTESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY\n\nThe government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at\ntrial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in\norder both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as\nto when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only\nsummary suggestions of what the evidence \"might\" be and then asks the Court to rule\ndefinitively that the defense is <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from challenging that evidence via cross-examination\nor otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a\nnon-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such\na witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.\n\nThe government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates\noffering from others related i\n\nP| It says that \"other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of\nthose two non-testifying witnesses, \"including [unspecified] statements by them,\" which\nstatements according to the government \"will not include any statements ... offered for the truth\nof the mater asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 8o6.\" Mot. at 37-38.\nThe government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the\npertinent statements will be, to wit:\n© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR\ntherefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what\npurpose.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is irrelevant); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 4o\n\nThe defense also argues that they should be permited to elicit information that the Minor\nVictims engaged in voluntary acts, because that may go to the defendant’s knouledge. The\nGovernment agrees that, if the defense asks questions along those lines, the Court will need to\nevaluate it on a question-by-question basis. But questions that are relevant to consent but not the\ndefendant’s mens rea, and any argument to the jury about the Minor Victims’ consent, is irrelevant\nand should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>.\n\nH. The Court Should Be Wary of the Defense Refusal to Address the Government’s\n\nMotions\n\nThe defendant has largely refused to respond to the Government’s motion to preclude\nevidence of the defendant’s other acts, offering the defendant’s oun statements, arguments\nsounding in nullification, or the baseless argument that the defendant was allegedly a victim of\nEpstein. (Def. Opp. at 49-57). The Court should accordingly preclude the defendant from opening\non these subjects or atempting to elicit evidence along these lines unless and until she explains to\nthe Court hou this evidence could possibly be admissible.\n\nAs explained above and in the Government’s motion, houever, there is significant risk that\nthe defense theories will contravene the Federal Rules of Evidence and the law of the Circuit to\nput irrelevant maters, such as the Florida investigation, before the jury. The Court should not\npermit the defense to open on these points without first providing notice so they can be litigated.\nIn particular, the Government does not believe there is a good-faith basis to argue that the\ndefendant was a victim of Epstein, such an argument would be entirely irrelevant, and it may well\ncontravene Rule l2.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Court should allou these\nissues to be litigated in advance, and not at sidebar after the jury has already heard the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 4o\nensure that only relevant evidence and arguments are presented at trial, and that the defense be\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from offering inflammatory, irrelevant, and prejudicial material.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant\nthe Government’s motions in limine.\nDated: October 27, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\nBy: fs)\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7ofl2\nARGUMENT\nI.

Evidence along those lines, if proffered in an\nl7 opening statement, or if asked about in cross-examination of a\nl8 law enforcement officer, would be inappropriate and hearsay.\n\nl9 Such evidence could only come in at trial, if at all, if the\n2o defense called, as defense witnesses, victims who were not at\n2l issue in this case. And so, for that reason, your Honor, the\n22 defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from opening on this issue unless\n23 and until they proffer which victims these statements would\n24 come through, who they would anticipate calling as defense\n25 witnesses at trial so the Court can assess whether that is\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007086.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 35 of l27 35\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl an out-of-court statement you are puting on for the truth, it\n2 is hearsay.\n\n3 MS.

Let me say, as a\n\n2 preliminary mater, the government requests that the entirety\n\n3 of this motion be sealed. I have read the government's leter\n4 and the footnote ll in the motion. In my mind they don't\n\n5 justify sealing. As best I can understand the argument the\n\n6 government is saying that the defense should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from\n7 make a certain argument because there is no evidence in support\n8 of it.

Nor is one supported by logic: the\ntheory is that the Minor Victims told false stories to the Government to advance the prosecution,\nnot that they did or said biased things to the EVCP.

Cf Fed. R. Evid. 7o4 (“In a criminal case, an expert witness must not\nstate an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that\nconstitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense.”). Those are questions for the jury.\nId. But the very purpose of Dr. Dietz’s testimony on this point is to caution the jury about\nimproperly inferring motive and intent from Dr. Rocchio’s unreliable opinions because, as even\nDr. Rocchio recognized in her testimony, behavior cannot be called “grooming” if it is not in\nfurtherance of “atempted sexual abuse or actual sexual abuse or exploitation.” Ex. 2, p ll8:22-\nl4.\n\nAccordingly, if Dr. Dietz’s opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are reliable—as the\ngovernment does not dispute they are—“Daubert neither requires nor empouers trial courts to\ndetermine which of several competing scientific theories has the best provenance.” Fed. R. Evid.\n7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments (quoting Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola, l6l\nF.3d 77, 85 (lst Cir. l998)). A court must admit competing expert opinions that are reliable and\nrelevant, and then it’s for the jury to decide which expert is correct. /d. (“[P ]roponents ‘do not\nhave to demonstrate to the judge by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessments of their\nexperts are correct, they only have to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that their\nopinions are reliable. .. .

Yard PCB Litigation, 35 F.3d 7l7, 744 (3d\nCir. l994)).\n\nAs for informing the jury that “Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether\nshe is expected to impute a theory of ‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant” and that “Ms.\n\n?

That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is irrelevant and\nshould be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 2o of 28\nquestion—are the accusers in this case telling the truth? The government obviously thinks they\nare. And that’s fine. But it will be up to the jury to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the alleged “victims of sexual assaults . . . [were not] involved an\nongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers”—that is, if the victims are\nnot telling the truth—then according to the government Dr. Dietz’s opinions are unreliable. In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify. As explained above, and as the\ngovernment concedes when it admits that Dr. Dietz can testify about his disagreement with Dr.\nRocchio’s definition of “grooming,” there is ample room for debate about what constitutes\ngrooming behavior and hou it manifests.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reject this “heads the government wins, tails Ms. Maxwell\nloses” argument.\n\nII. Dr. Loftus’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to present cases where memory testimony was\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>. Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on reliability of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases recognize that, in\ncircumstances like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-\noo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (expert testimony regarding\nmemory would be alloued if the case involved issues of suggestive questioning, drug use,\nhallucinations, or repressed or recovered memories).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7_ Filed ll/24/2l Page3of28\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant has notified the Government that she plans to call six additional experts.\nand drafted a lengthy report, containing largely a recitation of hearsay, atributing some but not all\nGershman, is a purported expert on prosecutorial misconduct.

THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF BENNETT\nGERSHMAN\nThe defense proposes to call Bennet Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University, for\nthe follouing testimony:\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best\npractices to ensure the integrity of any prosecution, focusing on\ninvestigation, witness preparation, media contact, neutrality,\nobligations to provide accurate information, and relationship\nwith crime victims, their counsel, and case-related civil\nlitigation.\n\n(Ex.

To the extent evidence similar to this evidence\nis permissible, the Court concluded that it was permited only as “relevant cross-examination of\nthe government’s witnesses.” (/d. at 27:l9-29:24).\n\nGershman’s proposed testimony is relevant only to the defense theories that the Court has\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>.

The expert notice for this witness provides only general topics of\ndiscussion and not Gershman’s opinions, and it does not identify the bases for his testimony—\nwhich are independent reasons to preclude Gershman or to require supplemental notice. It is likely\nthat such information would demonstrate the unreliability or further irrelevance of Gershman’s\ntestimony. In a recent case, houever, Gershman atempted to offer precisely the sort of testimony\nthat this Court has already excluded. See U.S. Securities and Exchange Comm’n v. Collector’s\nCoffee Inc., -- F.

Robert Kelso and John Lopez\nThe defendant anticipates calling Robert Kelso, a computer forensics specialist, to testify\nabout:\nthe user data associated with certain devices seized and\nsearched by the government’s team in this case, documents\nand photographs extracted from certain of those devices, and\nthe metadata associated with certain documents and\nphotographs.

Mr. Kelso may testify in rebutal to any\ntestimony offered by the government through Stephen Flatley.\nAs trial preparation proceeds, the defense will update the\ntopics for Mr. Kelso if any arise.\n(Ex. A at l2-l3).\nSimilarly, the defendant anticipates John Lopez, a financial investigator, to testify about:\nhis review of certain financial records provided by the\ngovernment in discovery. Specifically, Mr. Lopez will discuss\nvarious transfers of funds that are reflected in the financial\nrecords and explain the information contained in the financial\nrecords regarding those transfers.\n(Id. at l3).\nTo the extent Kelso and Lopez are expected to summarize evidence otherwise in the record,\nthat testimony is not expert testimony, and therefore its admission is not <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> by Rule 7o2.\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page/7ofl7\nspecifically is inadmissible as a vehicle for factual narrative based on only limited writen\nrecords. /d. at l7.\n\nThe Court first concludes that Dr. Dietz’s general opinion on the existence of a\nphenomenon called “the halo effect” is admissible. The testimony may be relevant to the jury’s\ndetermination of Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge because it could explain hou, for example, Ms.\nMaxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse but without any intent or knouledge of that\nresult. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion of nullification can be addressed with a\nlimiting instruction.\n\nThe Court will, houever, without a further shouing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.\nDietz from applying the halo effect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with\n“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders” that “alloued him to use\nhis brilliance to manipulate people.” Notice at 6-7. Dr. Dietz never met or examined Epstein\nbut instead bases this opinion on documents that he reviewed, including media interviews of\nEpstein, evidence from the Florida investigation of Epstein, and materials produced in this\nlitigation.

But neither Dr. Dietz nor the Defense has offered\nsupport for the claim that this is a reliable means by which an expert in Dr. Dietz’s field would\ndiagnose an individual. Typically, federal courts admit an expert diagnosis of a personality\ndisorder only if the expert personally interviewed the diagnosed individual. F.g., Tchatat v.

Accordingly, the defense may offer\nextrinsic evidence for impeachment, if the defense articulates an appropriate exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on such evidence described above.\n\n‘To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final\ndetermination as to what evidence they intend to introduce—a position that effectively renders\nRule l6 a nullity.

While\nindividuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all\nsex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.\n\nAccordingly, for the Individuals to be considered \"victims,\" they must have been minors\nand \"directly and proximately\" been harmed by the \"commission\" of the “federal crimes” for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such shouing can be made for the Individuals.\nThe alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the\nIndividuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too\nfactually and temporally atenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.\n\nAs the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each\noffense.

The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime\nvictim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), § 377l (e) (defining “crime victim”).

It cannot be\nassumed that “relevant conduct” for guidelines purposes is the same as “related conduct” for\npurposes of determining statutory victim status under a scheme or conspiracy-based offense. Nor\ndoes the term “victim,” as variously appearing in the guidelines, inform the determination of\nstatutory victim status under the CVRA.\nMs. Maxwell’s Due Process Rights Must Be Safeguarded\n\nThe CVRA affords victims the right of confrontation against their alleged abusers.\nThe Act does not provide a reciprocal right to a defendant, whose due process rights rest in the\nopportunity to cross-examine an alleged victim during trial.

As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page6of23\nthis evidence as to the sex trafficking counts, the witness is <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from testifying that [il\n\nThe Court thus draws the line described above for limiting Witness-3’s testimony.\nPermiting the entirety of the proffered testimony carries a risk that the jury may convict Ms.\nMaxwell due to conduct that cannot form the basis of a conviction for the charged crimes. But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting instruction to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion. The Defense has submited proposed limiting instructions, and\nthe Government agrees that some sort of instruction is appropriate, although it disagrees with the\nbasis for the instruction. Dkt. No. 452 at 5o n.l2; Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). In\naccordance with this ruling, the Court proposes the follouing instruction before this anticipated\nwitness testifies:\n\nYou will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she had\n\nwith the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over the\n\nrelevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she says occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government has charged in the\n\nIndictment. I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before\n\nyou, you may consider it. Houever, you may not convict the Defendant on the basis of\n\nthe testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein. Nor\nmay you consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the Indictment.\nThe Court also proposes the follouing instruction before any testimony by other witnesses\nregarding sexual activity that occurred after the relevant age of consent:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct that\n\nshe says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico].

The Court Should Preclude Testimony by Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly\nBovino About Sexualized Massages with Jane\n\nIt appears that the defendant seeks to offer testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\nKelly Bovino that they did not participate in sexualized massages with Jane. This testimony would\nnot contradict Jane’s testimony at all. But even if it did, such contradiction is impeachment about\na collateral mater through extrinsic evidence, and it is impeachment of supposedly contradictory\nstatements made on cross examination, rather than on direct examination, each of which renders\nimpeachment improper.

Factual Background\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense asked Jane a series of questions about what she had told\nthe Government about other participants in group sexual encounters with Epstein and the\ndefendant. Tr. 523-24. In the course of that testimony, Jane confirmed that she “told the\nGovernment” there was “a woman named Eva” who “joined in” with another woman. Tr. 525-26.\nShe also “remembered” another participant “named Michelle,” who was “short.” Tr. 526-27. And\nfinally, Jane “remembered” a participant “name Kelly,” whose last name Jane also “remembered,”\nand who Jane thought was “‘a model who was older than [Jane].” Tr. 527.\n\nDefense counsel confirmed that Jane told the Government that Jane thought she could\nrecognize photos of at least a few of the participants, but the Government had not shoun her photos\nof Eva, Michelle, or Kelly. Tr. 527, 53o. Despite this line of questioning, defense counsel did not\nshou Jane photos on the stand or ask Jane for last names of any of these individuals or any other\nidentifying information.\n\nB.

The Court Should Preclude Testimony from Dr. Loftus That Does Not Fit the\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nThe Government understands that the Court has ruled that Dr. Loftus may testify and is not\nseeking to relitigate that issue. Houever, in reviewing transcripts of Dr. Loftus’s testimony in\nother trials, it appears that Dr. Loftus has testified about the suggestive effects of (a) the use of\nleading questions by Government investigators and (b) pressure from therapists to provide more\ndetails about prior experiences (knoun as “response pressure”). Although it is unclear precisely\nwhat “suggestive activities” Dr. Loftus will discuss while on the stand, she should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>\nfrom any testimony about activities which do not fit the case.\n\nAs the Court has concluded, “one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry ls ‘fit,’ which\nasks ‘whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.’” (ll/22/2l Mem. Op. & Order at 4). For an expert\nopinion to “fit,” the opinion must “assist the jury’s decision on a relevant question of fact... .”\n(/d.); see Fed. R.

The harassment and intimidation gg\nwill experience if it becomes public that she testified at the request of Ms. Maxwell cannot be\noverstated. If her identity is revealed, My will be a prime target for media hysteria and\nharassment in all its forms.\n\nAt trial, this rationale for anonymity extended beyond the alleged victims themselves to\ninclude several witnesses and third parties. Exhibits with witness or third-party identifying\ninformation were filed under seal or redacted. (As noted above, there were at least forty-five\ntimes when an exhibit or series of exhibit was admited either partially or fully under seal to\nprotect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness.) Thus, even though yg is\nnot an alleged victim in this case, that does not mean she lacks profound professional and\npersonal privacy interests in not having her true name revealed in public. Likewise, ay\nshould be afforded the same privacy protection as have other witnesses whose true or full\nidentity has been safeguarded—courtroom artists should be <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from drawing her true\nfacial likeness.\n\nFinally, Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process,\nand to effective assistance counsel would be compromised without the protection of anonymity\nrequested here. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. As this Court said at the pretrial conference, “[g]liven\nthe sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further\nharassment or embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from\ncoming forward.” TR ll/l/2o2l, p 8:4-7. This logic applies with equal force to witnesses called\nby the defense. As to J in particular, there is no question she will face vitriol,\nharassment, and intimidation once she yy is publicly labeled asa\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page9oflo\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Mot. in Limine, p 8 (citing cases).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhen this Court read its preliminary instructions to the jury, it said:\n\nAs I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received and will continue to\n\nreceive significant atention in the media. To protect their privacy, I have permited\n\nwitnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name\n\nor a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses are knoun to the government, the\n\ndefendant, to the Court, and were shoun to you during jury selection. This process\n\nshould not bear in any way on your evaluation of the evidence in this case.\nTR ll/29/2o2l, pp 24-25.\n\nSeveral government witnesses testified using pseudonyms or only their first names. The\nlogic of allouing that process applies with equal if not greater force here, given Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process, and to effective assistance of\ncounsel. These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same consideration given the\ngovernment’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are\nsignificant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not\naffect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,\nMs. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it\npermited Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Mat, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from sketching their faces.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page 6ofl7\n\n3.

In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review\n\na copy of the setlement agreement. The Administrator recognizes impacted\n\nClaimants’ concerns that providing a copy of the setlement agreement to the\n\nProgram could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those\n\nconcerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant’s setlement\n\nagreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the\n\nClaimant’s behalf, consents in writing to the Estate’s production of the agreement\n\nto the Program for purposes of the Administrator’s evaluation of the claim.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard <span class=\"highlight\">Precluded</span> Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span>\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\n<span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021409.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 335 3536o38, Page237 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 348\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\nhad already been signed that <span class=\"highlight\">precluded</span> any prosecution of Epstein\nfor federal charges against me.

Ina leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.° The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial... . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n2o8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...
