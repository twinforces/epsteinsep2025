The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future <span class=\"highlight\">orientation</span>, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability.

During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department.

She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future <span class=\"highlight\">orientation</span>, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with\nEpstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the atorney conference area for a psychological\nobservation follou-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan and was\n\n43\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023743.tif": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nl.
