The government’s April l2\" disclosure of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span>.

We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool635", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn an effort to protect the trial process from “prejudicial outside interferences,” this Court\npromulgated Local Criminal Rule 23.l(a) which provides, in relevant part, that:\n\nIt is the duty of the lawyer or law firm, ... and government agents\nand police officers, not to release or authorize the release of non-\npublic information or opinion which a reasonable person would\nexpect to be disseminated by means of public communication, in\nconnection with pending or imminent criminal litigation with\nwhich they are associated, if there is a substantial likelihood that\nsuch dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice.\n\nTo avoid any confusion this Court identified seven “subject maters” that “presumptively\ninvolve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or\notherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” /d. at (d). Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span> with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6o Filed lo/o6/2o Page 2 of 3\nPage 2\n\n§ 37l.

During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F.

Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when\nit has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming\nforward to assist in the Government’s investigation.

Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none.

In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\n<span class=\"highlight\">interference</span> would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the treatment of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 4of5\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Courts have noted that “disclosing the details of\nthe Government’s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the\nindividuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice.” United States v. Madoff,\n626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). And the Government’s interest in protecting an\nongoing investigation from the “danger of impairing law enforcement” may be a countervailing\nfactor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. But the\nGovernment advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the\nmater would be imperiled by the disclosure of the information regarding hou it obtained the\ninformation in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrouly tailored. As a result,\nthe Court denies the Government’s redaction requests in pages l-l28 and denies its request to\nfile Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same\nreasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more\ntailored redactions if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested\ninformation and documents. By March 22, 2o2l, the Government may file a leter with the\nCourt—under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific redaction and sealing requests.\nAlternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request.\n\nFurthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l87-l88 of the Government’s brief. While the Court previously had granted\nthe request to redact the same information, see Dkt. No. 99, the Court no longer sees a basis for\nkeeping this information under seal in light of the strong presumption of access. The information\ndoes not in itself contain any personally identifying information, and the Court concludes that\nany minimal threat of <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span> with the Government’s investigation through the disclosure of\nthis information is outweighed by the presumption of access that ataches to those portions.

The government’s April l2\" disclosure of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4\", 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span>. Counsel\nhave other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follou the\nsummer trial of this case. These commitments make us unavailable from September through\nDecember, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,\nbefore mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled.

As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\n<span class=\"highlight\">interference</span>. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process.

The Program is independent of and entirely free from any <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span> or control by\nthe Epstein Estate.

The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span> or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019490.jpg": "OGsedl ZDaraO S BOs Aden (hdc WAG 2o2 F iB 62Al/PAg eayeftl Ab7\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nApp.o3l\nDOJ-OGR-oool949o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019491.jpg": "OGsedl ZAD Aa S BOs ATT tide WH 2o2 F i62l /PAg eagei2i ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nApp.o32\nDOJ-OGR-oool949l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019555.jpg": "CGsedl ZD ae SBos Aden (hdc WHE 2o2 F iB 68h /Pag eatyei2i ab4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary <span class=\"highlight\">interference</span> with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020312.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tran S3osaTentDGcWAErW/ 2o2l , RINRDO3B, 57Abe Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The calls most affected were\n| the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson.\n| I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are\nable to be legible with the use of the equalizer by louering the\nbackground noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a\ntape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of\nthe tape marked Property Number o5-243 to have it recopied to have an\noriginal in evidence and a working copy with the file.\nUpon researching the file, it was discovered that the suspect, Haley\nRobson's cellular calls were subpoenaed incorrectly. The suspect\ntelephone number was 56l-3o8-o282 and the original request was for\n56l-9o8-o282. I requested the information through Cingular Cellular\nService from February 2oo5 through the present.
