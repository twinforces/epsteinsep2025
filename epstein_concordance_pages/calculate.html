The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to <span class=\"highlight\">calculate</span> the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o.
