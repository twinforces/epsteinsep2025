In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases.

Rather than focus narrouly on reliable opinions that would be relevant to\nissues in this case, the defendant proposes to have Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus testify broadly about\na wide variety of topics, from testimony about various psychological disorders to testimony\nregarding the generation of false memories in <span class=\"highlight\">laboratory</span> setings, that are not helpful to the jury.\nMany of those opinions are also unreliable, squarely within the ken of the average juror, or would\ninvade the province of the Court and the jury if offered.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Rocchio is permited to testify on her opinions, the Court should admit\nreliable opinions on the same topics by defense experts. But the defense’s expert notice for Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus is far more expansive, and some of the defense’s responsive opinions are not\nreliable. The Court should preclude many of their opinions.\n\nl. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE CERTAIN OPINIONS FROM DR. DIETZ\nA. Background\n\nAs described in the defense expert notice, atached as Exhibit A!, the defense offers the\nopinions of Dr. Dietz, an expert psychiatrist, both in response to the Government’s expert Dr. Lisa\nRocchio and on several other subjects.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version of Exhibit A and to seal Exhibit B. The\nproposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although these exhibits are\njudicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been\npublicly identified, and who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain\nvictims and witnesses testify under pseudonyms, and third parties. Because the Government has\nalready moved to file a redacted version of Exhibit A (see Dkt. No. 4l8), the same version is\natached to this motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 35of4l\nabout the bases or details of Dr. Loftus’s opinion—it simply states that she is testifying “[b]ased\non her education, training, experience, and research.” (Ex. A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\n<span class=\"highlight\">laboratory</span> experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI\n'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also\nexplained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating\nindividuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr.\nRocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have\nexperienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. A at 2). The Government also produced\nits notes from its interviews with Dr. Rocchio simultaneously with its expert notice. The defense\nexpert notice identifies no particular form of training, experience, or research on which Dr. Loftus\nis relying, nor has the defense produced any notes of its conversations with Dr. Loftus.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6246", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">laboratory</span> animals. In those studies, <span class=\"highlight\">laboratory</span> conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v.

Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases.

Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A.

Can you please explain that to the jury.\n\nl8 A. Oftentimes, at retrieval, when somebody is answering a\n\nl9 question or reporting on what they remember from an event, they\n2o might be asked to express the level of confidence, you knou,\n2l I'm prety sure it happened, I'm very sure or what have you.\n22 And one of the things we knou is if the conditions are very\n23 pristine, not a lot of -- not a lot of suggestion, not a long\n24 period of time, they're a fair test, people are more accurate\n25 when they're confident than when they're not confident.

So going back, actually, to the typical eyewitness study,\nll witnesses see an accident, they really saw the car go through a\nl2 stop sign.

Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a\n\n6 memory more reliable than one that does not?\n\n7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones\n\n8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you knou, the\n\n9 core of what happened. You knou that what you saw was a plane\nlo crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but\nll even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event\n\nl2 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.\nl3 Q.

Can you please explain that to the jury.\n\nl8 A. Oftentimes, at retrieval, when somebody is answering a\n\nl9 question or reporting on what they remember from an event, they\n2o might be asked to express the level of confidence, you knou,\n2l I'm prety sure it happened, I'm very sure or what have you.\n22 And one of the things we knou is if the conditions are very\n23 pristine, not a lot of -- not a lot of suggestion, not a long\n24 period of time, they're a fair test, people are more accurate\n25 when they're confident than when they're not confident.

So going back, actually, to the typical eyewitness study,\nll witnesses see an accident, they really saw the car go through a\nl2 stop sign. Later on, you suggest it was a yield sign and many\nl3 people will succumb to the suggestion.
