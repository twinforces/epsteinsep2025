A\n\n2 conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is\n\n3 appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations.\n\n4 It is also, in my view, required that the court\n\n5 consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing\n\n6 and before deciding whether to grant the motion.

The transcript\nquotes the court, in pertinent part, as follous with reference to me and the article: “On a somewhat more\nserious note, don’t quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is :\nhimself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I’m\ncertain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.” Later in the :\nhearing, atorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.\nJust to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate\nor to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in\nsupport of Professor Dershouitz’s motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. :\nDershouitz, l:l9-cv-o3377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstein- /\nrelated.” My work as an expert witness, which <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> in June, did not involve my representation of, :\nor advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershouitz.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000770.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 ~ Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of5\nBSF\n2o24). Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. /d. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar protection for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the\ngrand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/ Sigrid S. McCawley\nSigrid S.

It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a renewed\nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December\nl4, 2o2o. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2o2o, the Court denied that motion, concluding that\nthe Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her\nappearance. Dkt.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge.

Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000895.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagel9 of 25\nmotion.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package.

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001149.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNE n De GmMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Rage 7l Ob 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001151.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+ANEt DOEUMEr? loo2 Filed6R248/7thgPageb l636\n\nthe Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001206.jpg": "CdSesk Zt ef o 32osAT Ne niDGcimeh) lo32l , ARB Dao sageRage Hof 4\nIN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION\nON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES\nRE GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nADDENDUM OPINION\n\nl. | This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government’s Memorandum\nin Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion to Release dated l6 December\n2o2o, insofar as it pertains to maters of English extradition law and practice.\n\n2.

In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001244.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOoo88oHAEN Add uUMeht /LOF l FileadsasO9F2Ag ePage?lGhe\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001325.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88). She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5. Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the\nrisks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated\nclient, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no\nunderlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from\nCOVID-l9.° (/d. at 89-9o). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were\nsufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the\nGovernment to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between\ncounsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the\nDistrict Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (/d. at\n9o-9l).\n\n* For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make\npurchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC. Before her arrest,\nMaxwell ignored FBI agents’ directions to open the door and tried to flee to another\nroom in the house. A cell phone was found wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.

Judge Nathan acknouledged\nthat “leters of support” writen by friends and family “substantiate the Defendant’s\nclaim that she has important ties to people in the United States,” but found that the\nleters “leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden” for Maxwell in light of, among other things, her claim at\nthe time of arrest that she was geting divorced, her lack of employment, and her\nsignificant ties to family and friends abroad.

She explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything,\n\nstronger nou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court\n\nthat the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial Services\n\nwere woefully incomplete.

Judge Nathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Maxwell’s new application did not\ndisturb her prior conclusions. (/d. at 2). She reiterated that detention was warranted\nin light of the proffered strength and nature of the Government’s case, Maxwell’s\n“substantial international ties, familial and personal connections abroad, substantial\nfinancial resources, and experience evading detection,” and Maxwell’s “lack of\ncandor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

It seems like the only rule\nis to get Ms. Maxwell at all costs. And it seems that a conviction is not\neven enough for the Government — it wants to go so far as to humiliate\nMs. Maxwell with false statements about the cleanliness of her cell.

After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

The human rights grounds that might potentially\nbe relied upon by Ms Maxwell are considered in the paragraphs that follou®’.\n\nArticle 3 (prison conditions)\n\n36. Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (protection of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 7 of 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 9 of 36\n\nthe Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3-2 Filed l2/23/2o Page 2 of 4\nIN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION\nON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES\nRE GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nADDENDUM OPINION\n\nl. | This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government’s Memorandum\nin Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion to Release dated l6 December\n2o2o, insofar as it pertains to maters of English extradition law and practice.\n\n2.

In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings.

Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page Lof22  ._\n\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/28/2o __ |]\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION AND ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI.

The result was a one-off agreement that deviated in several material respects from, and\nbore litle resemblance to, a standard agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s OPR, after investigating Acosta’s handling of the Epstein\ncase, characterized the NPA as a “unique resolution.” Exh.

While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms\nto which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.\n\nA. The Structure of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”).

In E/-Sadig, the court held\nthat the defendant, who was alleged to have purchased firearms unlawfully for two members of\nthe Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to\nenforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to prosecute any of the\nindividuals involved in the purchase. l33 F.

The court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “even if\nthe non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can\nenforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 6o8. Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement.

Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were\nthird-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the\nagreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.

In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIL.

In applying Landgraf, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “expressly\nprescribed” analysis is not limited to the text of the statute, but may look to legislative history.\nSee Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history”\nas part of first Landgraf step); see also Latab v. Ashcroft, 384 F. 3d 8, l4 (lst Cir. 2oo4) (‘our\ninquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of\nstatutory construction, such as the statute’s structure and legislative history”).

See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4)\n(stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to look to the elements and the\nnature of the offense . . .rather than to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v.\nDavis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\nidentified conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit used this approach in interpreting l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3237(a), a venue statute that applies to “[a]ny offense involving the use of the mails,\ntransportation in interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into\nthe United States.” The court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “[t]he most natural reading” of the statute is “‘to\nconstrue ‘any offense involving’ by reference to the e/ements of the offense at issue.” 393 F.3d\nl92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4) (emphasis in original). The court then gave an illustrative example of\na case in which a defendant travels in interstate commerce, commits a federal offense, and then\nreturns home via interstate commerce:\n\n[T]he circumstances surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in\n\ninterstate commerce, but his crime is not an “offense involving” transportation in\n\ninterstate commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the\n\nstatute in the order in which they are writen suggests that an “offense involv[es]”\n\ntransportation in interstate commerce only when such transportation is an element\n\nof the offense.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 25\nId. Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under\nthe age of l8 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an\nelement of the offense.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> as much in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th\nCir. 2oll). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of possession of child\npornography. /d. at 8l7-l8. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts\nof the case did involve the sexual abuse of a child, including the production and possession of\nchild pornography. /d. at 8l3-l4. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of\npossession of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general\nstatute of limitations, but the offense of production of child pornography did involve sexual\nabuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the\ntime of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing child\npornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., the sexual abuse of a child.” Jd. at\n8l7.\n\nCoutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other\nstatutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a\nparticular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse\nor kidnapping of a child. /d. at 8l7. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of\n§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the\ngovernment would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the\noffense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its\ncharges are not time-barred.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 25\n\nSuch a “necessarily entails” or “elements of the offense” approach is particularly\nappropriate for three additional reasons here. First, like the Wartime Suspension Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the exception narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the exception is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany exception to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\nconstruction”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB. The offenses charged in Counts One through Four do not necessarily entail\n\nthe sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.\n\nUnder the “necessarily entails” approach, § 3283 does not apply: None of the charged\ncounts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” See l8\n® Nor has the Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because the issue arose in the context of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> only that it was “not obvious” that § 3283 required an elements-\nbased approach. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 53, 58-59.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\ngovernment, but have not been able to agree on a disclosure schedule and therefore renew this\nrequest as part of this motion for a bill of particulars.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s efforts to prepare for trial have also been significantly impaired by the\nlack of specificity in the indictment. In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a bill of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574. Asa result, Bortnovsky held, “[t]he relevance of key events was\nshrouded in mystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial.” Jd. at 575.\n\nMs. Maxwell is similarly hindered. The indictment charges Ms. Maxwell with enticing\nor arranging travel for an unidentified individual, Accuser-l,* from Florida to New York at some\npoint during a four-year period. Yet the government has not alleged the dates of Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged interactions with Accuser-l, the dates when Accuser-l allegedly traveled across state\nlines for the purpose of engaging in sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, the dates on which\nMs. Maxwell allegedly enticed the complainant to do so, and the actions Ms. Maxwell allegedly\ntook to entice Accuser-l to travel. Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in discovery. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3.

No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein.

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v.

The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec.

It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002832.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafada bi 26 2o\nbeen any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd. (emphasis added). And in :\napplying this principle, the Bahna court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the correct community was not the entire |\nEastern District, but the two counties—Nassau and Suffolk—comprising the Uniondale\ncourthouse. Id. Thus because there was no underrepresentation shoun between the Uniondale |\njury wheel (e.g. the jury venire) and the Uniondale counties (e.g. the community), the court |\nrejected the defendant’s fair cross-section challenge. Id. |\n\nJust as Bahna rejected the proposition that the relevant community was the entire Eastern |\nDistrict, this Court also rejects Schulte’s contention that the relevant community is the\nManhatan counties or the entire District. See id. Because Schulte’s grand jury venire was\ndrawn from White Plains, Bahna instructs the Court to “look to that division” as the relevant |\ncommunity in assessing his fair cross-section challenge. See id. The Court must therefore |\nconclude that the White Plains counties represent the relevant community.\n\nThere is one caveat. The precursor to applying Bahna, of course, is that it must have |\nbeen proper for the Government to have sought the Indictment from White Plains. 68 F.3d at 24 . :\n(“Where a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to |\nsee whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.”) (emphasis\nadded). And on this issue, Schulte contends that the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains “deviated from the established, court-tested, and constitutional\npractice of indicting defendants in the division in which the offenses allegedly occurred and in\nwhich the case will be tried.” (Schulte Br. at 2.) This argument must be rejected for two\nreasons.\n\nFirst, the Court finds no persuasive or binding authority that supports the premise that the\nGovernment must indict defendants in the same courthouse as where the trial is scheduled to\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002840.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouRraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads 8 Bf 2o\nfrom the counties that overlap both courthouses; and (4) the clerical error by which voters who\nhad registered with an alternate mailing address were excluded from jury selection. (Schulte Br.\nat l9 -- 22; Schulte Reply at ll-l5.) For the follouing reasons, the Court concludes that these :\nallegations do not offend the JSSA.\n\nThe Government’s Decision. The Government’s appropriate decision to seek the |\nIndictment in White Plains was entirely proper and in accordance with the Constitution, JSSA, |\nand customary practice. See supra ll-l3. Accordingly, this prosecutorial decision cannot be |\nsaid to contravene the JSSA. |\n\nExclusion of Inactive Voters. In United States v. Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *lo, Judge ,\nRoman addressed the issue of whether the exclusion of inactive voters from certain counties used :\nby White Plains violated the ISSA. See id. Judge Roman <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the exclusion did not, |\nreasoning that it is “entirely logical for a jury selection process to exclude individuals who have\nsince moved,” see id., and even if it did, that the defect was merely a “technical violation” of the :\nJSSA. Id. Because the Court agrees with this reasoning on all counts, it concludes that the\nexclusion of inactive voters here does not violate the JSSA.\n\nErroneous Proration & Alternate Mailing Address. Lastiy, Schulte argues that |\nprospective jurors from the overlapping counties of Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland were\nincorrectly prorated between the two courthouses, and that a technical glitch inadvertently\nexcluded jurors who had registered to vote with alternate mailing addresses. (Schulte Br, at 2l—\n22; Schulte Reply at l3-l4.) The Court is unpersuaded. As to the former contention, Schulte\ndoes not explain hou the alleged proration error constitutes a “substantial” violation of the JSSA, |\nespecially where its “effect” appears to be “minimal.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *ll (rejecting\nthe same argument on the basis that it was merely a “technical violation of the ISSA”).

We have long recognized that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

The same holds true here.\n\nIn support of her claim that she has standing to enforce the NPA, the defendant relies upon\nthree district court decisions, none of which analyzed the threshold question of whether third party\nstanding concepts from contract law apply to plea agreements. In United States v. Florida West\nInt’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9, l228 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the district court applied the third\nparty beneficiary doctrine to a former airline employee based on a prior plea agreement with the\nairline that immunized, among others, current and former employees of the airline and its\nsubsidiaries. In its analysis, houever, the court applied the doctrine without analyzing the question\nof whether third party beneficiary standing principles apply to plea agreements. /d. For similar\nreasons, the defendant’s reliance on United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo, 6o8-o9 (N.D.\nOhio 2ool) is misplaced. In that case, the court permited a third party to invoke a plea agreement,\nbut it did not analyze or address whether third party standing rules apply to plea agreements. /d.\nLikewise, in United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3 (D.S.C. l984), the court\napplied the third party beneficiary doctrine, but relied solely on contracts treatises for support, and\ndid not analyze whether that doctrine should be applied to plea agreements.\n\nIn any event, even if third party beneficiaries had standing to enforce federal plea\nagreements, the defendant has failed to establish that she is a third party beneficiary of the NPA.\nIn order to establish that she has enforceable rights under the NPA, the defendant must shou that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 239\n“a direct and primary object of the contracting parties was to confer a benefit on the third party.”\nFla.

In other words, “the intent of the parties is the key” to evaluating\nwhether an individual is a third party beneficiary. /d.\n\nHere, the defendant has offered no evidence that the parties intended to confer a benefit on\nher in particular, or that her crimes in the l99os make her a member of the class of “co-\nconspirators” the parties had in mind when they negotiated the NPA. To the contrary, the OPR’s\ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of this provision in the NPA strongly\nundercuts any such argument, and OPR’s findings demonstrate that the parties did not intend to\nconfer a benefit on the defendant.

With respect to Maxwell in particular, OPR interviewed Maria Villafafia, the\nlead prosecutor on the case, and noted:\nVillafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s\nlongtime relationship with a close female friend who was a well-\nknoun socialite, but, according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t\nhave any specific evidence against her.” Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would\nbenefit from the provision were the four female assistants identified\nby name.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 239\nOPR Report at l67.'° After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the negotiation, OPR\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the evidence does not shou that [Former USAO-SDFL U.S. Atorney Alex]\nAcosta, [Former USAO-SDFL supervisor Andrew] Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the\nnonprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.” OPR Report at l68.\"\n\nIn view of OPR’s conclusions—and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary\nproffered by the defendant—the defendant has failed to establish that that she was an intended\nthird party beneficiary of the NPA. Accordingly, the defendant lacks standing to enforce the NPA.\n\nC. The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional Discovery or a Hearing\n\nThe defendant’s motion for discovery and a hearing fares no beter. Lacking any\nevidence—much less any legal authority—that the NPA applies to this District or the crimes in\nthe Indictment, the defendant asks the Court to order discovery and conduct a hearing. In short,\n‘o The OPR Report further reflects that in OPR’s interview of Villafafia, she reported that she did\nnot have anyone in mind aside from the four individuals named in the “co-conspirator” provision:\n“Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-\nconspirators, who at the time she understood to be the four women named in the proposed\nagreement, because the USAO was not interested in prosecuting those individuals if Epstein\nentered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l. Similarly, the report\nreflects that a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told OPR “that it never occurred to him that the reference\nto potential co-conspirators was directed touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at\nthe time or subsequently linked with Epstein.” OPR Report at 8o-8l.\n\n'! Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003019.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 85 of 239\nparticular, this mater appears to be the only remaining active civil case in this District in which\nclaims against Ghislaine Maxwell have been asserted.” (2o Civ. 484 (DCF) (JGK), Dkt.

The\ndefendant ignores the fact that cases such as this one take time to investigate and indict.\n\nThe defendant also suggests that the Government engaged in reckless disregard of\ncircumstances that would likely impede her ability to mount an effective defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at\n5-6, l5). As an initial mater, this argument falls short of “a standard that requires a shouing of\nintentionality.” United States v.

Baseless speculation aside, the defendant offers no argument or\nevidence as to hou or why the Government acted recklessly here.\n\nIn sum, not only does the defendant fail to demonstrate actual, non-speculative prejudice\nouing to pre-indictment delay, but she also fails to establish that the Government intentionally\n4 This Court has noted “some disagreement among the district courts in this Circuit as to whether\nreckless—as opposed to intentional—disregard of circumstances . . . may support a due process\nchallenge based on pre-indictment delay,” but <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the pertinent decisions [], on\nbalance, more plainly comport with a standard that requires a shouing of intentionality.” Wey,\n2ol7 WL 23765l, at *l3 n.8 (citing Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (defendant bears burden of shouing\nthat “delay was a course intentionally pursued by the government for an improper purpose”)\n(emphasis added)); see also United States v.

Chief Judge McMahon <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller.

Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN),\nof Chief Judge McMahon’s decision via ex parte and sealed leter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. I).\nSubsequently, on April l6, 2ol9, Judge Netburn denied the Government’s application. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H). Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the\nprotective order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional\ncircumstances or a compelling need. (/d. at 3). She <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the protective order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and\n“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the\nGovernment must demonstrate not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that\nthe reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to\nmodify the Protective Order.

Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\ntranscript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), l998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary\ncircumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\nAmendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003121.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 239\nMurgio, 2o9 F.

See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

The state intentionally torpedoed it in the\ngrand jury so it was brought to us. I am going to forward the pros\nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do. The\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “(t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 348\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial.

Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafana Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!°7\nLefkouitz <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta was previously\nscheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October ll and to speak at the Palm\nBeach County Bench Bar conference the follouing midday, and that he stayed overnight at the\nMarriot.\nlB Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury maters.\nl8 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.\n89\nDOJ-OGR- oooo329l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 348\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”!4© Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>. Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou. Can I persuade you to atend?”\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l33 of 348\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed.

The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “‘misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.”” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence.

USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses.

OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate.

Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution\n\nIn September 2oo7, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey\nEpstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the Office of the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to\nplead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. /d.

It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of\nhis “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility\nobserved, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.\nOPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S. Atorney’s\npromise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements.

The report <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\nU.S. Atorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,\nbut nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” Jd. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell\ncontends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of\nJeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal\nlimitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New\nYork. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the Sl superseding indictment.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3677\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here.

Both Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to\nprotect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with\nfairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #l\nand Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position.

An acquaintance of Jane Doe\n#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4\nto go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the\nphone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to\nhis mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nJane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large\nbathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters.

The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic exclusion, noting that “systematic exclusion does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority population.” /d. at 42.

STERNHEIAA\n\nThanksgiving. The government does not explain why this witness is unavailable, and then they\n\nnote, in a footnote, that the witness actually would be available to testify touards the end of the\ngovernment’s case. In essence, that is less a “conflict” than a requirement that the government\n\nput on its case in a different order. It is also biterly ironic that the government had been pushing\n\nfor the earliest possible trial date to protect the victims’ interests, but nou seeks to postpone it to\n\nkeep the trial team together and to put its witnesses on in a preferred order.\n\nBy contrast, pushing the trial to the end of November will have a severe and irreparable\nimpact on Ms. Maxwell's defense. First, she will be detained longer. Second, the estimated four\nweeks for the government's case will result in Ms. Maxwell's defense being pressed to conclude\nbefore the holidays or worse, extending the case into the new year, which the Court already\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> was unwarranted delay. While the government may complete its case-in-chief before\nChristmas, the defense will not. This will cast defense counsel and the defense case in a negative\nlight as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won’t. Third,\nstarting on the Monday after Thanksgiving will pose impediments to the potential jury pool —\nmany of whom will hopefully be able to travel to see family for the first time since before\nCOVID -- and will disrupt travel plans for counsel and our families. Fourth, Ms. Maxwell's\nwitnesses who will be traveling from various locations will be forced to book uncertain travel\nplans in the days leading up to — or after -- the holiday season.\n\nTo accommodate the government’s vaguely articulated scheduling issues, we informed\ngovernment counsel that we would consider starting on November l5, but no later.\n\nWe firmly request that the Court set the trial to start on November 8\" to ensure that the\ntrial will conclude before Christmas.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 2l of 34\nmaters that were the subject of the Giuffre [defamation] Action,” and having been misled by\nAUSA | tesponse, Judge McMahon erroneously (though blamelessly) <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\n\n[nJothing in this record suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything\n\nto do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand jury to look into the\n\nmaters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. . .

There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein.

As she explained in connection with Rule\n26.2 disclosures (Jt. Leter of May 3, 2o2l), gaining access to Ms. Maxwell’s witness list and\nexhibits prior to trial gives an advantage to the government to the detriment of the defense. A\nrecent decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is instructive.

The NPA Bars Ms. Maxwell’s Prosecution on Counts One, Three, Five, and Six.\n\nThe NPA bars any prosecution of Ms. Maxwell for the offenses charged in Counts One,\nThree, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment. The Court has already <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the NPA bars\nprosecution for “three specific categories of offenses” deriving from the Florida Investigation:\n\n(l) ‘the offenses set out on pages | and 2’ of the NPA; namely, ‘any offenses\n\nthat may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from\nin or around 2ool through in or around September 2oo7’ including five\nenumerated offenses:\n\n(2) ‘any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s\nOffice’; and\n(3) ‘any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation.’\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page lo of 32\n(Dkt. 2o7 at 6 (quoting NPA)). The Court has further <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the NPA’s co-conspirator\nprovision covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell” in any of these same three categories of\noffenses. (/d. at 7). There can be no serious dispute that the sex trafficking offenses charged in\nCounts Five and Six were investigated as part of the Florida Investigation and fall squarely\nwithin the three categories of immunized offenses that are covered by the NPA. Moreover,\nbecause Counts Five and Six are based on the exact same allegations from the very same accuser\nthat were previously investigated and presented to the grand jury as part of the Florida\nInvestigation, Annabi and its progeny do not apply and the NPA is binding on the USAO-SDNY\nas to these offenses. Accordingly, Counts Five and Six must be dismissed. Moreover, because\nCounts One and Three incorporate the same conduct from Counts Five and Six for which Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be prosecuted under the NPA, they must also be dismissed.\n\nA. Counts Five and Six Allege the Same Offenses that Were Part of the Florida\n\nInvestigation and Are Covered by the Plain Terms of the NPA.\n\nThe plain terms of the NPA preclude Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution on Counts Five and Six\nbecause they allege conduct that falls within the date range specified in the NPA and charge\nspecifically enumerated offenses that were part of the Florida Investigation. Count Five alleges\nthat “[f]rom at least in or about 2ool up to and including in or about 2oo4,” Ms. Maxwell\nconspired with Epstein to violate l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a), the law prohibiting sex trafficking of\nminors. (S2 Indictment {J 22-25). Count Six alleges that during the same time period, Ms.\nMaxwell commited a substantive violation of the same statute. (/d. J] 26-27). The NPA bars\nprosecution for Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in “any offenses that may have been commited by\nEpstein against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around September 2oo7\nincluding five enumerated offenses.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 6 (internal quotations omited); see also id. at\n7 (NPA covers, among other things, “any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 349\nSecretary of Labor.

In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 53 of 349\nforward with charges in this case. Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case. I am going\nto start reading it tonight. ... It’s a major case because the target is\none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news. He\nhas a stable of atorneys, including Dershouitz, [Roy] Black,\nLefcourt, Lewis, and Lily [sic] Sanchez. Jeff Sloman is familiar\nwith the investigation. The state intentionally torpedoed it in the\ngrand jury so it was brought to us. I am going to forward the pros\nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do. The\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3’ Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 98 of 349\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items? I was hoping to work only a\n\nhalf day tomorrou to save my voice for Tuesday’s hearing . . . , if\n\nnecessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet\n\n“off campus” somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.'!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’]s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command . . . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges] . . . , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nls According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nts Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo4 of 349\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafana Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo9 of 349\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll4 of 349\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender ....” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll6 of 349\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims].

The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l24 of 349\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l29 of 349\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4o of 349\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 272 of 349\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o4 of 349\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”).

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\nFe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

Sixth, a bill of particulars is not warranted, especially when\nboth the speaking indictment and discovery in this case provide ample details regarding the\ncharged offenses. Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 7 of 26\ndistrict bringing the second prosecution charges offenses different from the offenses resolved by\nthe plea agreement in the first prosecution.” (Def. Mot. at ll) (emphasis in original). The\ndefendant is wrong. Annabi contains no such exception, and the Government is not aware of any\ncourt in this Circuit to apply such a rule.\n\nIn Annabi, the Second Circuit articulated a universal principle for interpreting whether a\nplea agreement is binding outside the district where it was executed. Annabi explained that,\nalthough it “might be thought” that a U.S. Atorney’s Office’s agreement which provided that “‘the\nGovernment’ will dismiss counts of an indictment” would bind the United States in every judicial\ndistrict, “the law has evolved to the contrary.” 77l F.2d at 672. Relying on several of its\nprecedents, the Court explained that the default rule in this Circuit is that plea agreements bind\nonly the district involved, absent an affirmative appearance to the contrary. /d. In particular, the\nSecond Circuit relied on its opinions in United States v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d lo65, lo72 (2d Cir.\nl985), and United States v. Alessi, 544 F.2d ll39, ll54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 96o\n(l976). Nothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same\noffenses that were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be\ncovered by the plea agreement. The holding of Annabi is clear and straightforward, and this Court\nhas already <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that, under Annabi, there is no affirmative appearance that the NPA binds\nentities aside from the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe defendant nou claims that when the Government brings charges that are similar to\nthose contained in a plea agreement, Annabi is silent, and that the Court is therefore free to apply\nthe opposite presumption, namely, that the plea agreement is universally binding on the\nGovernment. The defendant’s argument rests exclusively on the phrase “identical to the dismissed\ncharges,” which appears in a paragraph in Annabi. (Def. Mot. at ll). The defendant’s reliance on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 26\ncrimes listed in the NPA overlap with some (but not all)? of the offenses in the S2 Indictment. But\nat this stage of the litigation, in which the Court has already <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the NPA has no force\nin this District, it makes no difference what the precise terms of the NPA were. The NPA has no\nbearing on this case.\n\nThe balance of the defendant’s motion seeks to relitigate the Court’s rulings in this case,\nasserting that the history of the negotiations of the NPA indicate that the parties intended broader\ncoverage. (Def. Mot. at l6). This Court has firmly rejected that argument and has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\n“In]o evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his\ncoconspirators in other districts.” (Apr. Op. at 6). The motion should be denied for precisely this\nreason.\n\nII. Counts Five and Six Are Not Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\nIt is axiomatic that “an accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double\njeopardy.” Serfass v. United States, 42o U.S. 377, 393 (l975). Here, the S2 Indictment is the first\ntime the defendant has been charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy, and the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause therefore does not prohibit prosecution of those offenses. The\ndefendant’s argument to the contrary fundamentally misunderstands that Clause’s protections.\n\n“TA]t its core,” the Double Jeopardy Clause “means that those acquited or convicted of a\nparticular ‘offence’ cannot be tried a second time for the same ‘offence.’”” Gamble v. United States,\nl39 S. Ct. l96o, l963 (2ol9). Accordingly, “[a] defendant may only raise a Double Jeopardy\nclaim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime before the alleged\n‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second\n> At most, the scope of the NPA’s coverage would appear to encompass Counts Five and Six. The\nremaining counts encompass conduct that both postdates and predates the temporal limitations in\nthe NPA, which was expressly limited to offenses between 2ool and 2oo7. (Apr. Op. at 6-7).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Pagel7 of 26\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s previous briefing (Dkt. No. 2o4\nat 23-36), and for the reasons set forth in the Court’s April Opinion (Apr. Op. at 9-l6), the\nprosecution of Counts Five and Six is timely.\nIV. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the S2 Indictment Based on Alleged Improper\n\nPre-Trial Delay Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant contends that the Court should dismiss the S2 Indictment because the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing the charges violates her due process rights. (Def. Mot. at 22). In\nmaking this motion, the defendant asks the Court to provide such relief for the “same reasons\ndiscussed in her prior motion” (Def. Mot. at 22)—reasons this Court already considered and\nrejected. This Court evaluated the defendant’s speculative and baseless arguments and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nthat the defendant could not meet the “stringent standard” necessary to prevail on a claim that any\nalleged pre-indictment delay violates her due process rights. (Apr. Op. at l7). “To prevail on a\nclaim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a defendant must shou both that the\nGovernment intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the delay\nseriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the charges.” (Apr. Op. at l7 (citing\nUnited States v.

The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors. As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court thus finds that Maxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing under\neither prong of Franks, and thus that she is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)). Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\ncircumstances to modify the protective order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that modification was necessary under the circumstances to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation. Although reasonable minds may differ—indeed, Judge Netburn reached the\nopposite conclusion—there was a substantial basis for Judge McMahon’s decision and it is thus\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 8o\ndefects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to\n\nmake a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.\n\n| told him that | was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not\n\nbe alloued to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that\n\nAndrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of\n\nPennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was\n\nsubpoenaed, he would be required to testify.\n\nBut those two things were not connected one to the other.

After [Cosby's] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby].

Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand\nafter the assault. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire\ninterceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, allegations made by other women were\nalso investigated.

In a 2ol6 Philadelphia Inquirer article, in\nreference to this same sentence, Castor stated, “I put in there that if any\nevidence surfaced that was admissible | would revisit the issue. And\nevidently, that is what the D.A. is doing.” He testified that he remembered\nmaking that statement but that it referred to the possibility of a prosecution\nbased on other victims in Montgomery County or perjury.\n\nHe testified that the press release was intended for three audiences, the\nmedia, the greater legal community, and the litigants. He testified about\nwhat meaning he hoped that each audience would glean from the press\nrelease. He did not intend for any of the three groups to understand the\nentirety of what he meant. The media was to understand only that [Cosby]\nwould not be arrested. Lawyers would parse every word and understand\nthat he was saying there was enough evidence to arrest [Cosby] but that\nMr. Castor thought the evidence was not credible or admissible. The third\naudience was the litigants, and they were to understand that they did not\nwant to damage the civil case. He then stated that the litigants would\nunderstand the entirety of the press release, the legal community most of it\nand the press litle of it.\nMr. Castor testified that in November of 2ol4 he was contacted by the\nmedia as a result of a joke a comedian made about [Cosby]. Again, in the\nsummer of 2ol5 after the civil depositions were released, media\napproached Mr. Castor. He testified that he told every reporter that he\nspoke to in this time frame that the reason he had declined the charges was\nto strip Mr. Cosby of his Fifth Amendment privilege.

Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 47 of 8o\nThe decisions belou, barring prosecution of the Stipetiches, embodied\nconcern that allouing charges to be brought after George Stipetich had\nperformed his part of the agreement by answering questions about sources\nof the contraband discovered in his residence would be fundamentally unfair\nbecause in answering the questions he may have disclosed information that\ncould be used against him.

Although the Superior Court dismissed this passage from Stipetich as dicta,\nit found the situation distinguishable in any event inasmuch as former D.A. Castor testified\nthat there was no “agreement” or “quid pro quo” with Cosby, and, therefore, any reliance\nthat Cosby placed upon the district atorney's promise was unreasonable. Cosby, 224\nA.3d at 4l6-l7.\n\nThe Superior Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that it was bound by the trial court’s factual findings\nand by its credibility determinations. The trial court had “determined that Mr. Castor’s\ntestimony and, by implication, Atorney Schmit’s testimony (which was premised upon\ninformation he indirectly received from Mr. Castor) were not credible.” /d. at 4l7. The\npanel added that the trial court had “found that the weight of the evidence supported its\nfinding that no agreement or grant of immunity was made, and that [Cosby] did not\nreasonably rely on any overtures by Mr. Castor to that effect when he sat for his civil\ndeposition.” /d. Thus, the Superior Court discerned no error in the trial court’s decision\nto allou the use of Cosby’s deposition testimony against him at trial.'®\nng In addition to the Rule 4o4(b) and non-prosecutions claims, the Superior Court\nrejected a number of other issues raised by Cosby, including an assertion of improper\njuror bias, a challenge to an allegedly misleading jury instruction, and a contention that\nSORNA was unconstitutional. Cosby, 224 A.3d at 396, 42l-43l.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited).

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A. Castor and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\ncircumstances, implicated Cosby’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal.

The local rules do not apply as I do not currently represent Ghislaine\nMaxwell in any proceeding and have not entered an appearance in\nthis Court.\n\nBecause undersigned counsel does not currently represent Ms. Maxwell in any\ncourt and has never entered an appearance as her lawyer in this Court, the local rules\ndo not apply.

Because undersigned counsel does not represent a party ora\nwitness, the Government’s request should be denied.\n\nUndersigned counsel was previously retained to represent Ms. Maxwell’s family.\nThen, when this Court denied her third bail application, undersigned counsel was\nretained to represent Ms. Maxwell in the Second Circuit on her bail appeal (and not\nregarding the merits of the case).

In fact,\nundersigned counsel and Ms. Maxwell’s trial team have been very careful to keep the\nrepresentation separate. I have not been provided any of the trial discovery.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v.

Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules.

Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call fora\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULB.C, § 3299,\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Tn]Jotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 32o Filed o8/l8/2l Page2of4\nHonorable Alison J.

In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nSeparate and apart from the Court’s prior ruling, the government has not established a\nsufficient connection between the alleged false statements and the alleged sex abuse offenses to\nintroduce the statements as evidence of concealment of the later. The alleged false statements\nwere made at unrelated civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\nintroduced as proof of concealment of those offenses. See United States v. Marcus Schloss &\nCo., Inc., 7lo F.

Essentially, the police believed that Mr. Epstein\nwas not being treated harshly enough and that here had been an excessive amount of delay in the\nprosecution because of the inaction by the prosecuting atorneys. The disagreements over hou\nthe case was being prosecuted became significant and public. The Chief of Police, Mr. Reiter,\nwrote several leters to the prosecuting atorneys including a leter suggesting that the\nprosecutors had a conflict of interest. In a leter to one of the alleged victims Chief Reiter wrote:\n“T do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the indictment that has been issued.\nTherefore please knou that his (sic) mater has been referred to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation to determine if violations of federal law have occurred.”\n\nThe reports and seized documents are a mash-up of a various hearsay sources. More often\nthan not, it is difficult to determine hou many multiple layers of hearsay exist with regard to a\nparticular piece of alleged evidence. Significantly, the Palm Beach Police Department Property\nReceipt/Search Warrant Return (Government Exhibit 295), atached as Exhibit A, is cursory, and\nreflects items moved in and out of the property department. Detective Recarey is dead, and no\nrecord custodian exists that can identify what was (l) seized; (2) what was maintained by the\nPalm Beach Police Department and by whom; (3) what was returned and (4) what was\npurportedly transferred to the FBI.

But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\nproffered evidence at trial.

If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

(/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2.

The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers.

(Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

(/d. at 5-6). The\nCourt also rejected the two additional conditions proposed by the defendant, noting the\n“Tclonsiderable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the [foreign\ncitizenship] renunciations,” and finding that, despite the proposed monitorship, the defendant\n“would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution.” (/d. at lo-ll). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “If the Court could conclude that any set\nof conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance, it would order her\nrelease. Yet while her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\n\n4. The Second Circuit’s Orders\n\nThe defendant filed appeals from the Court’s second and third detention orders. After\nhearing oral argument, the Circuit denied the defendant’s motion for bail in a writen order. (See\nUnited States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86 (2d Cir. Apr. 27, 2o2l)).\n\nFollouing that decision, the defendant submited a leter to this Court asking it “to address\nMs. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing MDC to cease l5-minute light surveillance of Ms.\nMaxwell or justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.” (Dkt. 256 at 2). The Court\npromptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an\nexplanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.\n(Dkt. 257, 27o). On May l4, 2o2l, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for\nan order directing the MDC to modify its nightime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282). In reaching\nthis decision, the Court noted that the defendant’s claim that MDC staff were shining the light\ndirectly into her eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page8oflil\nPage 8\n\npresumption of detention, the presumption does not disappear; instead, it becomes a factor to be\nweighed and considered in deciding whether release is warranted. /d.\n\nWhere the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the court must consider: (l)\n“the nature and circumstances of the offense charged”; (2) “the weight of the evidence against the\nperson”; and (3) the “history and characteristics of the person.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nA detention hearing may be reopened “at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds\nthat information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of such person as required.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f); see also United States v.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial international\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

Essentially, the police believed that Mr. Epstein\nwas not being treated harshly enough and that here had been an excessive amount of delay in the\nprosecution because of the inaction by the prosecuting atorneys. The disagreements over hou\nthe case was being prosecuted became significant and public. The Chief of Police, Mr. Reiter,\nwrote several leters to the prosecuting atorneys including a leter suggesting that the\nprosecutors had a conflict of interest.

That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to transport minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v.

In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007069.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465_ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel8 of l27 l8\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl used to \"atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the\n2 investigation.\"\n\n3 That holding has only limited relevance here.

Chavez, 229 F.3d\n946, 953-54 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (scrap of paper containing a phone number admissible “for the non-\nhearsay purpose of linking the co-conspirators,” but “the number could not have been submited\nfor the truth of the mater asserted”); United States v.

But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\ncircumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,\narguing that anonymity was necessary because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile prosecutions.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 6 of 24 l8\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl used to \"atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the\n2 investigation.\"\n\n3 That holding has only limited relevance here. First,\n4 the statement at issue in Kyles was probative because it\n\nS suggested the defendant's innocence, not because it was\n\n6 evidence of the reasons for the charging decision or the\n\n7 investigation's timeline.\n\n8 Second, the Second Circuit in Watson v.

The Second Circuit stated that cross-examination of\n22 the lead investigating officer on that tip was probative\n23 because the jury could conclude that law enforcement had\n24 prematurely <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> the defendant was the shooter and it\n25 failed to investigate diligently the possibility that it was\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing.

Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 23 of 37\nNew York law.

This resulted\nin the ultimate prejudice against Ms. Maxwell: a conviction on three of the four Mann Act\ncounts. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell was convicted on Counts One, Three, and Four based on a\nprejudicial variance from the charges in the Indictment. The Court must therefore vacate these\nconvictions and order a new trial.\n\nIl. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Only One of the Three Conspiracy Counts\n\nBecause They Are Multiplicitous.*\n\nSince the very first indictment in this case, the government’s conspiracy charges have\nbeen premised on a single criminal scheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to recruit and\n“groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity with Epstein. See Ind. 4 l-2.\nAlthough Counts One, Three, and Five of the S2 Indictment (the “Indictment”) charged Ms.\nMaxwell with three separate conspiracies under the general conspiracy statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l,\nthe allegations in the indictment were based on a single conspiratorial agreement to sexually\nabuse minors, not three separate agreements to violate three different statutes. See Ind. 2 (“As\n3 We accept the jury’s verdict on the conspiracy counts solely for the purposes of this motion.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v.

The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96.

But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F.

The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage.

The district judge <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of conviction is belied by the lawyers’ actions. There was no effort to seek a new\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009454.jpg": "Case lf2aser4oo33o& ABcurDecupreat 6l69/2o Filed Gea Pagrage 35 of ll7\nA-585o\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 8 of 29\n23. The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states.

I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did.

That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”).

The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant.

Offenses Charged\n\nTurning to the first Korfant factor, the “criminal offenses charged,” Counts Three and Five\nplainly charge different criminal offenses under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. In particular, Count Three is\npredicated on l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), a provision of the Mann Act that makes it a crime to transport\nminors for illegal sexual activity, whereas Count Five is predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a\nprovision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act that makes it a crime to traffic minors for\ncommercial sex acts. As charged in the $2 Indictment, these counts have different legal objects:\nCount Three concerned transporting girls under the age of seventeen to New York for purposes of\nsexual abuse in violation of New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and Count Five concerned commercial\nsex acts with girls under the age of eighteen.\n\nWhen two counts charge conspiracies under § 37l, “[s]imilarity at this general level . . . is\nof limited import,” where the objects of the conspiracies differ.

Similarly, in United States v.\nSatar, Judge Koeltl <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that two conspiracies charged under § 37l were distinct under\nKorfant, in part because the two counts “charge a separate conspiracy under the defraud clause\nand the offense clause of § 37l, respectively.” United States v.

The Court\nshould reject those arguments as it has before.\n\nThe defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\nCounts One and Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the record\nlacked sufficient evidence that the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this\nconspiracy persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-7o (“There is not testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\nMaxwell encouraged [Jane] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquited the defendant on Count\nTwo, the substantive enticement count. As to Count One, the jury could have readily <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nthat the defendant conspired with Epstein to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to\nEpstein’s various properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,\nJane testified that she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 32o). And the\nrecord is replete with testimony regarding the manner in which the defendant worked with Epstein\nto groom minor victims and entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties. (See, e.g., Tr. 3oo (Jane\nseeing the defendant topless), 348 (making Jane feel special, in part by taking her on “field trips”),\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l5 of 66\n\nIt also appears that Juror No. 5o did not delete his Instagram account, despite what\nhe told the Court, since he posted about his jury service after the verdict was returned.\n\nAt the end of the very brief voir dire examination, the Court asked Juror No. 5o if\nhe had “[a]ny doubt about [his] ability to” be fair to both sides. /d. at l34.

The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96.

Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in\nwhich the Court must consider the hypothetical question whether, if the juror had truthfully\nanswered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d\na post-verdict posture, if the Court were to find that Juror 5o intentionally lied about using social\nmedia accounts, the question would be whether the Court would have struck him if he had\ntruthfully answered that question. There is nothing in the record about Juror 5o’s use of social\nmedia accounts that would have supported a challenge for cause at voir dire.\n\nIn sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 34 of 49\n48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately\nresponded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government submits that: (l) the Court should conduct\nthe questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 5o should be narrouly tailored; (3) there is no basis to\ncall any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing discovery”\nshould be denied.\n\nl. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the\njuror from harassment or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the\njuror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (district court examined\njuror in camera, after permiting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.\nl989); United States v. Greer, 998 F.

But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009960.jpg": "CaebasPAROAG ORR OMEN TCO FRSOS DBPO7P ab dithey & 25o cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, y\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of conviction is belied by the lawyers’ actions. There was no effort to seek a new\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010133.jpg": "CaSes 2o2 Or OCRed AS NL Demet G6 8 2 Ciba OS OP Repay Ss S86 aflT7l 7\nA-585o\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 8 of 29\n23. The lawyers wrote: “The tone and content of the leter, which were in sharp contrast to\nthe image Conrad had projected through the trial (‘always head doun, taking notes’), caused\ndefendants concern and prompted them to investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And they later wrote:\n“This is not 2 situation where Conrad disclosed sufficient information to warrant inquiry by\ncounsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying in response to each of the\nCourt’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.l3 (internal citation and parenthetical quote omited).\n24. In my opinion, these statements should be seen as true, not merely literally true in a\nhypertechnical or crabbed sense of the word, but true as reasonably read. They do not become\nuntrue because a reader may draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend. The juror’s\nleter did cause concern and did prompt an investigation, as the first quotation in the\nmemorandum states. That statement does not disclaim a prior search, whether that prior search is\ncalled an investigation or something else. I believe that focus on the word “investigate,” which is\nnot a term of art, would be misguided here. The sentence correctly describes what the leter\ncaused the lawyers to do.\n25. The second quote focuses on the voir dire in March and is also true as reasonably read.\nThe lawyers had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the order suspending a lawyer with the same name as juror\nConrad was not a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s answers. Just the\nopposite. Her voir dire answers, in their view, dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer\nwould not lie under oath at voir dire, they reasoned, given the consequences to the lawyer’s\nability ever to regain admission to practice. In my opinion, this conclusion was compelling.\n26. It is also my opinion that the July 8, 2oll, memorandum, taken as a whole, does not\nshou a “knouing[]” violation of the provisions of Rule 3.3. It is true that even when a lawyer\ndoes not have a duty to speak, if she does speak, she may not knouingly misrepresent to a court\nor adversary. But an unintended inference is not a misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer\nlanguage in the memorandum’s true statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focused on the\nnew trial motion, did not anticipate what a reader might infer and what they did not mean to\n\n° imply — is not an action that can support a finding of unethical behavior under the New York\n\nRules.\n27. The lawyers understandably nou wish they had not included these passages as writen.\nGreater focus might have led them to anticipate hou others might read them differently than\nintended, and to omit them (they were unnecessary to the motion), rephrase them, or add the\nhistory of their earlier research. .\n\nThe July l5 Telephone Conference\n28. ‘In the July l5 telephone conference, the Court said that it wanted to “ascertain from each\nof the defendants ...whether any of them were aware of the disturbing things that have been\nrevealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited\na response on the call or via leter.

The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive amendment and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of24\na result, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased on a constructive amendment of the crime charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to muddy the common sense reading of the Jury\nNote by focusing on peripheral or irrelevant issues, or by mischaracterizing the text of the Note,\nor even by inserting words, phrases, and punctuation that are not contained in the Note, in an\neffort to confuse and complicate the analysis. (Opp. at l5-l7). This is nothing more than\nmisdirection and should be rejected.\n\nFor example, the government asserts that Jane’s testimony concerning the New Mexico\nconduct was proper and relevant to the jury’s consideration of the Mann Act counts, and that the\njury “could have convicted even if no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant intended for abuse to occur in New York.” (Opp. at ll-l2\n(emphasis in original)). The Court itself raised this same point in declining to give the jury the\nrequested supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l49-5o). Ms. Maxwell does not dispute either\nassertion. But that is not the issue raised by the Jury Note. In fact, the Jury Note makes clear\nthat the jury was considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without concluding that she\nintended for Jane to be abused in New York. The question posed in the Jury Note was whether\nMs. Maxwell could “be found guilty” under the second element of Count Four (to use the jury’s\noun words) if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\nin New Mexico. (Court Exhibit #l5). In other words, the jury was asking whether they could\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on that intent, and that intent alone. The answer to\nthat question is no, and the jury should have been so instructed to prevent a constructive\namendment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions.

That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire.

For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll.

The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 29 of 45\nalter the fact that the evidence and instructions at trial captured the core of criminality of the\nIndictment.\n\nThe jury note at issue read:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight,\n\nbut not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual\n\nactivity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\nCourt Ex. l5, Dkt. No. 593 at 23. After hearing from the parties, the Court determined that it\nwas unclear to what testimony the note referred and what legal question the note asked.\nAccordingly, the Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the appropriate course was to refer the jury back to the\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four, with a reminder to consider carefully the full\ninstruction. Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” /d. (citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel9 of 55\ncurrent version of the Guidelines as representing the most recent views of the agency charged by\nCongress with developing sentencing policy.” Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nWhere the Guidelines have increased after the offense conduct has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “the court\nshall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was\ncommited.” U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l). Furthermore, Application Note 2 provides that “the last\ndate of the offense of conviction is the controlling date” for determining which manual to apply.\nU.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(b)(l), app. n.2. That is true even if the Guidelines were amended during the\ncourse of the offense conduct. The Second Circuit has explained that “[w]here a conspiracy began\nwhile one version of the Guidelines was in effect and ended after another version became effective,\napplication of the later version to the coconspirators does not violate the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” United States v. Meneilly, 28 F. App’x 26, 32 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citations omited).\n\nHere, the offenses of conviction spanned from l994 up to and including 2oo4, as set forth\nin the Indictment, and as the proof established at trial. As a result, for Guidelines purposes,\nDecember 3l, 2oo4 is legally the last date of the offense conduct, and the 2oo4 Manual applies.\nIn her objections to the PSR, the defendant claims that the Ex Post Facto clause requires the jury,\nand not the Court, to determine the last date of the offense of conviction. The defendant further\nclaims that, as a factual mater, the offense conduct ended before November l, 2oo4, the date upon\nwhich the 2oo4 Manual became effective. For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant is wrong\nas a mater of law and as a mater of fact. The Court should apply the 2oo4 Manual.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2l of55\nto resolve, and not the jury. Fusco, 56o F. App’x at 45-46 (citing United States v. Norris, 28l F.3d\n357, 369 (2d Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nLacking any authority for her argument, the defendant cites Peugh and offers her oun\nsweeping conclusion that, essentially, the Sixth Amendment requires that all Ex Post Facto issues\nbe resolved by juries. But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\ndetermination of which Guidelines Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which Guidelines Manual to apply.\n\n2. The Sex Trafficking Conspiracy Continued to 2oo5\n\nThe Indictment charged that the defendant participated in a conspiracy “from at least in or\nabout l994, up to and including at least in or about 2oo4,” and that is exactly what the Government\nproved at trial. (Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe conspiracy ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth certificate was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 47 of55\n\nUnlike the vast majority of inmates at the MDC, the defendant has been able to receive\nalmost immediate atention from legal counsel at the MDC, the Court, and the Government when\nraising issues regarding her confinement. Her lawyers have not hesitated to alert the Court to\nissues requiring its atention, and the Court has ensured that the defendant was able to prepare for\ntrial and participate in her defense. In addition, the defendant has filed numerous administrative\ncomplaints with the BOP, all of which have apparently been evaluated as unfounded. For example,\nthe Government understands from legal counsel at the MDC that the BOP has investigated the\ndefendant’s complaints of physical abuse and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that they are unfounded. Legal counsel\nat the MDC further informed the Government that all pat-doun searches of the defendant that took\nplace pretrial were, in fact, video recorded.\n\nTaken together with the defendant’s perjury in her civil deposition, her lies to Pretrial\nServices, and her blatant lies about her oun weight while in BOP custody, the Court can fairly\nreject many of the defendant’s complaints about her conditions of confinement. Simply put, the\ndefendant lies when it suits her. It apparently suits her to spread horror stories about her\nexperiences in jail to the press in an atempt to garner public sympathy. See, e.g., Laurence\nDollimore, Exclusive: Ghislaine Maxwell Speaks from Behind Bars for the First Time in the Mail\non Sunday: Heiress Tells Hou ‘Creepy’ Guards Have Forced Her to Stop Taking Shouers, Rats\nLive in Her Cell, and Why She Has No Hope of a Fair Trial, DAILY MAIL, Nov. l5, 2o2l (available\nat htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lol983o9/Ghislaine-Maxwell-speaks-bars-time-\nMail-Sunday.html) (last visited June 2o, 2o22). She is trying the same tactic nou with the Court.\n\nThe defense’s atempts to compare the defendant’s conditions of confinement to that of a\ndefendant under Special Administrative Measures (“SAMs”) are stunningly off-base. As the Court\nis well aware, before she was placed in general population, the defendant was permited out of her\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page52 of 55\nclaims that multiple abuses, all of which BOP has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> were unfounded, were somehou not\ncaught on camera. At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the Guidelines range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage\nof the trial. Given the defense’s exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somehou\ndeteriorated the defendant to the point of struggling to assist in her oun defense, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court put on the record at sentencing the Court’s oun observations\nof the defendant’s appearance and demeanor throughout the proceedings in this case.\n\nIV. Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692- Filed ll/22/2l Pagel3oofl7\n\nIn addition to diagnosing Alleged Victim 4’s mental conditions, Dr. Hall also <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nThe Government moved to exclude this conclusion and the Defense does not make a case for\nadmiting it. The Court will also preclude the opinion. In this circumstance, the lasting mental\nimpact of a crime is at best “minimally probative” of whether that crime was commited. United\nStates v. Hendricks, 92l F.3d 32o, 329 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It also carries a high risk of Rule 4o3\nprejudice by suggesting that the psychological impact on Alleged Victim 4 is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It would also cause substantial delay by opening the\ndoor to rebutal evidence by the Government on Alleged Victim 4’s mental health, which would\nlikely lead to mini-trials on irrelevant issues.\n\nNext, the disclosure states that Dr. Hall will testify to the “significance” of Alleged\nVictim 4’s diagnoses. Notice at l2. First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current disclosure\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d. Dr. Hall’s report refers not only to what Alleged Victim 4 told him during their\nin-person interview but also other records like ee\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page5 of lo\n\nhim to handle the ‘sheer amount of data that was produced.’” Jd. at 84. He then conducted a\n“comparative analysis,” and “<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that determining the provenance of the Digital Music files\nrequires conducting an individualized inquiry on a track-by-track basis.” Jd.; see id. at 85\n(describing the steps the witness had taken); cf’ United States v. Ganier, 468 F.3d 92o, 924, 926\n(6th Cir. 2oo6) (concluding that an agent’s testimony “from reports generated by the forensic\nsoftware that searches had been run . . . using search terms relevant to the grand jury investigation”\nrequired specialized knouledge to “make sense of the software reports’’).\n\nThe Government understands, houever, that this line is difficult to draw, and some\ndiscussion of the investigative steps Flatley has taken could be understood as testimony relying on\nhis technical knouledge. For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata. See Trial Tr. at 935-38, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr. 643 (PKC) (describing\nl The defense does not appear to dispute that Flatley could be qualified as an expert witness in this\nsubject; their objection is only one of notice.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Pageloofl2\nFT Just as extrinsic evidence on this point was improper during Kate’s cross, so it\nis Improper nou.\nee\nP| Hamilton’s rank speculation about Kate’s motives and intent are not probative\nof any issue in the case.\n\nThe remainder of the affidavit is simply background information about Hamilton and his\nrelationship with Kate. Accordingly, the affidavit reflects no admissible testimony that Hamilton\nmight offer, and he should be precluded from testifying to its contents.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Testimony from Dr. Loftus That Does Not Fit the\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nThe Government understands that the Court has ruled that Dr. Loftus may testify and is not\nseeking to relitigate that issue. Houever, in reviewing transcripts of Dr. Loftus’s testimony in\nother trials, it appears that Dr. Loftus has testified about the suggestive effects of (a) the use of\nleading questions by Government investigators and (b) pressure from therapists to provide more\ndetails about prior experiences (knoun as “response pressure”). Although it is unclear precisely\nwhat “suggestive activities” Dr. Loftus will discuss while on the stand, she should be precluded\nfrom any testimony about activities which do not fit the case.\n\nAs the Court has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry ls ‘fit,’ which\nasks ‘whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.’” (ll/22/2l Mem.

If necessary, the client may be persuaded to do\nboth. The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\ndisclosure of information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original expectations\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 47 oflol 47\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl cite some cases for that proposition.

To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v.

Dkt. 785 (“Motion to Unseal’”’).’ The\nmotion stated:\n\nOn July 6, 2o25, the [DOJ] and [FBI] issued a memorandum describing an\n\nexhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n(the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the [DOJ]\n\nand [FBI] to determine whether evidence existed that could predicate an\n\ninvestigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, no such\n\nevidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\n\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the\n\nconclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is\n\nof the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the\n\ninvestigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]\n\nmoves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.\n\nMaxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-\n\nrelated and other personal identifying information.\n\nId.

Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review.

The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nApp.lol\nDOJ-OGR-oool956o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019620.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Pagel3 of 37\n7\n\nopportunity to do so in her pretrial motions in the\ncriminal case before Judge Nathan. (A. 93-94).\nD. Judge Nathan’s Order\n\nOn September 2, 2o2o, Judge Nathan issued the\nOrder denying Maxwell’s motion. (A. 99-lo3). In that\nOrder, Judge Nathan noted that despite “fourteen-sin-\ngle spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had of-\nfered “no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory\nassertions” regarding why the criminal discovery ma-\nterials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil\ncases. (A. lol). Judge Nathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that absent\nany “coherent explanation” of hou the criminal discov-\nery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-\ntended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had\n“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\nProtective Order. (A. lol). Further, Judge Nathan\nnoted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce\nin civil litigation were already made public through\nthe Government’s leter in opposition to her motion.\n(A. lol-o2). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan\n“remain|[ed] in the dark as to why this information will\nbe relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases,\nJudge Nathan expressly permited Maxwell to inform\nthe tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic factual background regarding the confiden-\ntial criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. lol-o2).\nE. Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-\npeal from the Order. (A. l2l-23). On September lo,\n2o2o, Maxwell filed a motion to consolidate this appeal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool962o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019627.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page2o of 37\nl4\nprotective order’); Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 46\n(2d Cir. 2ol9) (third party intervenors, including mem-\nbers of the press, appealing order denying motion to\nmodify protective order in civil litigation to allou third\nparties access to sealed filings, after parties to the lit-\nigation setled). Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those\ncases was founded on the principle that when interve-\nnors seek access to sealed records, “orders denying ac-\ncess are final as to the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyra-\nmid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll7 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(emphasis added). Once the courts in those cases de-\nnied the intervenors’ motions to modify protective or-\nders, there was nothing left for those intervenors to Lit-\nigate. Here, by contrast, Judge Nathan’s Order did not\nend the entire litigation as to Maxwell. To the con-\ntrary, Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in\nDecember 2o2o and to proceed to trial in July 2o2l.\nWhen considering interlocutory appeals from rul-\nings on protective orders governing a criminal defend-\nant’s use of discovery materials, by contrast, this Court\nhas <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> it lacks jurisdiction. See Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. Maxwell cites no\ncase in which this Court has found jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory appeal of an order regulating the use of\nmaterials a criminal defendant received during litiga-\ntion, and her efforts to distinguish Pappas and Capar-\nros fall short. Pappas <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that where a protec-\ntive order “prohibits . .. disclosure of information [a de-\nfendant] acquired from the Government prior to the\nlitigation, the order is not a typical protective order\nregulating discovery documents and should be appeal-\nable because of the breadth of its restraint.” Pappas,\n94 F.3d at 798 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nDOJ-OGR-oool9627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019628.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page2l of 37\nl5\n\ntype of protective order at issue here. To the contrary,\nthe Protective Order in this case expressly provides\nthat its provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-\ning disclosure of any information, with the exception\nof victim or witness identifying information, that is\npublicly available or obtained by the Defendant or her\nDefense Counsel form a source other than the Govern-\nment.” (A. 84-85). Instead, the Protective Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26. The Court also <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the protec-\ntive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal\nafter final judgment and emphasized that the defend-\nant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order\nis not immediately reviewed.” Jd. So too here. Maxwell\nhas not articulated any serious injury she will suffer if\nthis Court dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical\nharm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising\nfrom the unsealing of filings in a civil case. Should any\nprejudicial publicity arise, though, Maxwell will be\nfully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry\nof final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 2l5, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether public-\nity biased the venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 5l5\nF.3d loo, l28-3l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (evaluating on post-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019636.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page29 of 37\n23\nmodify a protective order entered in a criminal case);\nUnited States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (8rd Cir.\n2oo7) (same).\nB. Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan did not abuse her discretion when\nentering the challenged Order. In reaching her deci-\nsion, Judge Nathan applied the correct legal standard,\nevaluated Maxwell’s argument that she needed to dis-\nclose certain criminal discovery materials to the rele-\nvant judicial officers to “ensure the fair adjudication of\nissues being litigated in those civil mater,” found that\nMaxwell’s proffered reasons for the request were\n“vague, speculative, and conclusory,” and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nthat Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to establish\ngood cause.” (A. lol). At no point did Judge Nathan\nfail to apply established law, and it cannot be said that\nher careful review of the parties’ arguments was not\nwithin the bounds of permissible discretion.\n\nFirst, Maxwell still fails to articulate any legal ba-\nsis for the use of discovery material received from the\nGovernment in a criminal case to litigate a separate\ncivil case. Maxwell expressly consented to the entry of\na Protective Order prohibiting her from using criminal\ndiscovery materials in civil litigation.7 In her motion\nto modify that Protective Order, Maxwell cited no legal\nauthority for the use of criminal discovery in civil liti-\ngation. Her appeal points to no such authority, and she\n\n7 Maxwell did so knouing that the Government\nhad charged her with perjury in connection with civil\ncases.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019711.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagel8 of l9\nmotion.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package.

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020067.jpg": "Caseabe? o-cs6o 8B GHANA DEcuMe? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Test 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020069.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep C33ouAUNIt Bescutrentl loo2 lF iG 422o8/2 o9g Pagel I ob 36\n\nthe Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020124.jpg": "Casmi@O‘c68oB3o:ANent DeocumemWes , FIGASTH/2Bade6Bayel 2nf 4\nIN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION\nON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES\nRE GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nADDENDUM OPINION\n\nl. | This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government’s Memorandum\nin Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion to Release dated l6 December\n2o2o, insofar as it pertains to maters of English extradition law and practice.\n\n2. The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020128.jpg": "CaSade2OtehQ)d3GouAunt Bibsutre/otl l26 lF ROG 3228o/2eg eeagef l OF ee\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:_l2/28/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\nVv\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION AND ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6).

Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020242.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page8 of 25\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).4 Judge Nathan\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be\ninsufficient” because Maxwell could remove the monitor and evade private guards.\n(/d. at 87-88). She also rejected Maxwell’s comparison to certain other high-profile\ndefendants, citing “crucial factual differences” in those cases. (/d. at 88).\n\nl5. Finally, Judge Nathan rejected Maxell’s arguments about the\nrisks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated\nclient, noting that Maxwell had many months to prepare for trial and has no\nunderlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from\nCOVID-l9.° (/d. at 89-9o). Judge Nathan found that measures in place were\nsufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her counsel, but also directed the\nGovernment to work with the defense “to provide adequate communication between\ncounsel and client” and stated that the defense may make specific applications to the\nDistrict Court for further relief if the process was “inadequate in any way.” (/d. at\n9o-9l).\n\n* For example, Maxwell did not leave her home but had security guards make\npurchases for her using a credit card in the name of an LLC.

As part of every pat-doun search, the defendant\nis required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked\nduring the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.” These pat-doun\nand mouth searches are consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they\nmove to a different location within the jail facility. In the absence of in-person visitation, the\ndefendant has not been strip searched. If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all\nother inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. At night,\nMDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress. To\ndo so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant’s cell\nto illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing. At night, MDC staff\nhave observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance\ncaused by the flashlight. Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly\nsleeps through these nightime wellness checks. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of\nthese searches are necessary for the safety of the institution and the defendant.\n\nThe Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in\nFebruary 2o2l regarding the defendant’s food, water, and physical wellbeing. In response, MDC\n> Follouing defense counsel’s complaint in its February l6, 2o2l leter of an inappropriately\nconducted pat-doun search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the\ndefendant’s claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera. After\nreviewing the camera footage, the MDC <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the search was conducted appropriately\nand the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further\nconfirmed that all pat-doun searches of the defendant are video recorded. Follouing this incident,\nMDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other\nthings, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which\ncaused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing\nthe cell to become increasingly dirty.

Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5).

With respect to eye coverings, Judge Nathan noted that the\nprohibition on eye masks “is a generally applicable policy,” but Maxwell is\nnevertheless permited to “use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes” at\nnight. (Ud. at 2). Judge Nathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “nothing in the record plausibly\nestablishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her\ntrial and communicate with her lawyers.” (/d.). Consistent with the atention she\nhas paid to Maxwell’s conditions of confinement throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan instructed the Government and the MDC “‘to continue to ensure\nthat Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols” that are “necessary for\nher safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent\nwith the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.” (/d.).\nARGUMENT\nMaxwell’s Motion Should Be Denied\n\n22.

Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to\nplead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. /d. In exchange, the U.S. Atorney’s Office agreed not to charge him\nwith federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his\nconduct between 2ool and 2oo7. /d. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of\nhis “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility\nobserved, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.\nOPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S. Atorney’s\npromise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added “with litle\ndiscussion or consideration by the prosecutors.” /d. at l69, l85. The report <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\nU.S. Atorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,\nbut nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” /d. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell\ncontends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of\nJeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal\nlimitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New\nYork. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the $l superseding indictment.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020812.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel94 of 2o8\nrenewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April l6 opinion. The Court\nwill proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor\nthe supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not\nbar the charges against her.\n\nAs the Court explained in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in\nUnited States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam).\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has folloued it steadfastly since.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v.\nBroun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2); United States v.\nSalameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 9l6,\n923 (2d Cir. l988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in\nEpstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea\nagreements. See Salameh, l52 F.3d at l2o. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it\nwould otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nMaxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this\nreasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a leter of supplemental authority.\nSee Dkt. Nos. 293, 3lo. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception\nfor out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in\nthe leter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020817.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel99 of 2o8\n\nThe Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its\nApril l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. As an initial mater, the Court reiterates that Maxwell’s\nanalysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a\n“categorical approach” nor an “essential ingredient” test, but instead requires that the defendant’s\nconduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2o2l WL\nl5l8675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity\nthat constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts.\n\nBut in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not\ncontest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex\ntrafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2oo6, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether\nthe limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § l59l. See l8\nULS.C. § 3299.\n\nMoreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have\noccurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2oo6, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless\napplies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, the Court\nanalyzed § 3283 under the Landgrafv. USA Film Products, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994) framework\nand <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations\nperiod had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2o2l WL l5l8675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which\nstates that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” shall apply, the\nlanguage of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses\n“Injotwithstanding any other law.” As discussed in the Court’s previous opinion with respect\nto § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply\nretroactively to prosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment so long as the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020960.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel34 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020977.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll.

She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIll. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33.

Trial Tr. at 3l4l. The Court also rejected the Defendant’s supplemental instruction\nproposed the follouing day because it was partially unresponsive, partially redundant, and\npartially an erroneous statement of law. /d. at 3l48-5o.\n\nThe Defendant’s contention that this series of events worked a constructive amendment\nto the Indictment is without merit. First, the Defendant speculates extensively about which\nflights and evidence the jury was referencing in the note, hazarding that the jury was focused on\na l997 flight from New York to New Mexico and an unidentified return flight to Florida. See\nMaxwell Br. at l4-l5. But Jane testified about taking numerous flights both on Epstein’s private\nplane and on commercial carriers. The note did not specify which of these many flights or other\ntestimony the jury was considering. The Court could not provide supplemental instruction based\non such a speculative foundation.\n\nSecond, the note was not “crystal clear” as the Defendant contends. Maxwell Reply at 6.\nRather, as sometimes occurs, the note was decidedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question\nbeing asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding-and-abeting liability as\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021021.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel95 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” Jd.

But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021079.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page32 of ll3\nuntenable reading without even granting Defendant’s request for discovery or a\nhearing to determine the scope of the agreement.\n\nTo support its creative reading of the NPA, the court relied on U.S. v.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). That case warrants close\natention. In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment\nin the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and\npossessing heroin with intent to distribute. See 77l F.2d at 67l. After they pled\nguilty to the substantive importation charge, the prosecutor represented to the court\nthat “the only agreement that exists between defendants and the Government is that\nat the time of the imposition of sentence ..., the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts...”. /d. Accordingly, the conspiracy and\npossession counts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were\nindicted in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to distribute heroin.\nSee id. Whereas the dismissed EDNY charges had only alleged a conspiracy on or\nabout a date in l982, the new SDNY charges alleged criminal conduct extending\nfrom l982 to l985. The defendants argued that these new charges were barred by\ntheir plea agreement with the USAO-EDNY. See id. The court conducted an\nevidentiary hearing—obtaining testimony from both the prosecutor and the defense\natorney from the Eastern District proceedings—and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the agreement\nwas not meant to bind the USAO-SDNY.

Nevertheless, the Court\ndeclared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,” adding, “[a] plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader\nrestriction.” Jd. The Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that, because the conspiracy alleged in the\nSDNY indictment “extended for an additional two years” beyond the date of the\nconspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements.” Id.\n\nAnnabi has been sharply criticized.

The\nDistrict Court cited Nijhawan for the proposition that “the word ‘involves’\ngenerally means courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as\ncommited in each case.” Al48. But Nijhawan says otherwise; there, the Supreme\nCourt reaffirmed its prior case law holding that statutory “language, covering\n‘crime[s]’ that ‘involv/e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another’ ... refers to crimes as generically defined.” 557 U.S. at 36\n(emphasis and brackets in original) (quoting James v.

In Coutentos, a jury found the defendant guilty on two\ncounts: sexual exploitation or atempted sexual exploitation of a minor to produce\nchild pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) and (d)) and possession or atempted\npossession of child pornography (l8 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)). Both\ncounts were untimely unless § 3283 applied. As the Court’s recitation of the facts\nmade clear, the production and possession counts were based on the same\nunderlying conduct: the defendant’s abuse of his granddaughters to create child\npormography. See Coutentos, 65l F.3d at 8l3-l4. Thus, in a factual sense, the\ndefendant’s possession clearly involved the sexual abuse of a child. Nevertheless,\nthe Eighth Circuit, while affirming the production conviction, vacated the\npossession conviction on the ground that it was not an “offense involving the\nsexual...abuse of a child” within the precise meaning of § 3283.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.37 Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get ano-bill on this... and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\nat In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021271.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 348\nfor them to be deported.”!!* As to whether the foreign nationals would be removable by virtue of\nhaving commited crimes, Villafafia told OPR she did not consider her role as seeking removal\napart from actual prosecution.\n\nVillafafia <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> her email to Lefkouitz by expressing disappointment that they were\nnot “closer to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and offering to meet the next day to work\non the agreement:\n\nCan I suggest that tomorrou we either meet live or via\n\nteleconference, either with your client or having him within a quick\n\nphone call, to hash out these items?

I will make sure that I have\n\nall the necessary decision makers present or “on call,” as well.!°\nVillafafia told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkouitz away from the USAO because conducting\nnegotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafafia wanted “to have a meeting where we sat doun\nand just finalized things. And what I meant by off campus is, sometimes people feel beter if you\ngo to a neutral location” for a face-to-face meeting.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September l7, 2oo7, the USAO supervisor who was taking\nover Lourie’s duties as manager of the West Palm Beach office asked Villafafia for an update on\nthe plea negotiations, and she forwarded to him the email she had sent to Lefkouitz the previous\nafternoon. Villafafia told the manager, “As you can see... there are a number of things in their\nlast draft that were unacceptable. All of the loopholes that I sewed up they tried to open.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Villafafia alerted the new manager, Acosta, and Lourie that she had just\nspoken with Lefkouitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning touards a plea to state charges under\na non-prosecution agreement, and she would be forwarding to Lefkouitz “our last version of the\nNon-Prosecution Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make sure they knou it[’|s only a\ndraft” and reminded her that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.” Villafafia responded,\n“Absolutely. There were a lot of problems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open all the\nloopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided\nto Lefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the “last version” and would “avoid [him]\nhaving to reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case agents on the status of negotiations,\nnoting that she had told her “chain of command .. . that we are still on for the [September] 25th\n[to bring charges]... , no mater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to provide for his review a factual\nproffer for a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f\nHu According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office had an ICE agent working with them at the\nbeginning of the federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have looked into the immigration status of\nany foreign national, but neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any of the Epstein employees.\nHS Lefkouitz was based in New York City but traveled to Miami in connection with the case.\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021277.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo3 3536o38, Pagelo5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 348\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. '”° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” ”! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVt The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we... shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021282.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo8 3536o38, Pagello of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021287.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3536o38, Pagell5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>: “TI enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nai The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021289.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ATIS 3536o38, Pagell7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.’\nLefkouitz <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 38\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta was previously\nscheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October ll and to speak at the Palm\nBeach County Bench Bar conference the follouing midday, and that he stayed overnight at the\nMarriot.\nDB Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury maters.\nl38 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.\n89\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021292.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TIS 3536o38, Pagel2o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 348\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”'*° Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>. Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea?

Acosta’s leter <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021302.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l38 3536o38, Pagel3o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have ...a lot of victims... lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nTel Villatafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021313.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”'’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (‘OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021447.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel7 of 2l7\nSA-27l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27l of 348\n\nvictims deserve to be treated with fairness and respect, and to be conferred with on the criminal\ncase, not just because the CVRA requires it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral\nargument on January l6, 2o2o, the government apologized for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:\n\nThe issue is whether or not the office was fully transparent with\n\nMs. Wild about what it is that was going on with respect to the NPA,\n\nand they made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was\n\nongoing when in fact the NPA had been signed. The government\n\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\n\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.°”\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°°* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished /n re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc. On August 7, 2o2o, the court\ngranted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s opinion; as of the date of this\nReport, a briefing schedule has been issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2o2o.\n\n228 Audio recording of Oral Argument, Wild, No. l9-l3843 (Jan. l6, 2o2o).\nal Inve Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, l22o (llth Cir. 2o2o).\n245\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021457.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page27 of 2l7\nSA-28l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28l of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat ‘“[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”3?°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s intention to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\nane Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°° Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*°!

Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nel FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\nad Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021479.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o3 3536o39, Page49 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”*3’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”*78 The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.**° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\na6 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021491.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l5 3536o39, Page6l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l5 of 348\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\n7. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\nDs Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3. Communications with Victims and Victims’ Atorneys\nOPR contacted atorneys knoun to represent 26 victims among the 3o surviving individuals\nwho were identified in the USAO’s July 2oo8 listing of 32 victims the USAO was prepared to\ninclude in federal charges against Epstein and who accordingly were entitled to the benefits of the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 monetary damages provision of the NPA.

Discussion\n\nThe District Court correctly rejected Maxwell’s ar-\ngument that the NPA bars this prosecution. Maxwell\nhas no right to invoke the protections of the NPA be-\ncause she is neither a party to nor a third-party bene-\nficiary of the agreement. But even if Maxwell had\nstanding under the NPA, it would not bar this prose-\ncution because it was plainly intended to bind only the\nUSAO-SDFL. Thus, Judge Nathan rightly <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>\nthat under longstanding Second Circuit precedent, the\nNPA does not bind USAO-SDNY. Accordingly, this\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l676\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021680.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page33 of 93\n2o\nthat “the federal Grand Jury investigation will be sus-\npended.” (A.l78 (emphasis added)). The grand jury in-\nvestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-\nfer in the same agreement (A.l75), and not any poten-\ntial federal grand jury investigations in other districts.\nFurthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United\nStates” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-\nSDFL. For instance, the NPA commits the “United\nStates’—that is, the USAO-SDFL—to providing Ep-\nstein with a list of victims. (A.l77 (‘The United States\nshall provide Epstein’s atorneys with a list of individ-\nuals whom it has identified as victims ....”)). Another\nprovision states that the NPA will not be made part of\nthe public record and commits “the United States’—\nagain, the USAO-SDFL—to providing notice to Ep-\nstein if it receives a Freedom of Information Act re-\nquest requiring disclosure of the agreement. (A.l78).\nThe mere fact that the co-conspirator provision of the\nNPA used the phrase “United States” rather than\n“U.S. Atorney’s Office” is not evidence that the parties\nintended an unusually broad immunity provision. See,\ne.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S.\n5l9, 54o (2ol3) (‘We are not aware, houever, of any\ncanon of interpretation that forbids interpreting differ-\nent words used in different parts of the same statute\nto mean roughly the same thing.”). As Judge Nathan\n<span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, given the repeated limitations of the com-\nmitments in the NPA to the USAO-SDEL, including\nthe commitment not to prosecute Epstein, “[i]t is not\nplausible ... that the parties intended to drastically\nexpand the agreement’s scope in the single sentence on\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l68o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021688.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page4l of 93\n28\nidentifies no evidence that the Department of Justice\nmade any promises not contained in the NPA.” (A.l42-\n43). Here, as belou, Maxwell’s further request for a\nhearing “rests on mere conjecture.” (A.l45). Judge Na-\nthan did not abuse her discretion.\nPOINT II\nThe District Court Correctly <span class=\"highlight\">Concluded</span> that the\nCharges Were Timely\n\nIn 2oo3, Congress extended the statute of limita-\ntions for “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical\nabuse” of a minor to allou prosecution so long as the\nvictim remains alive. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Atempting to\nundermine the clear legislative intent, Maxwell argues\nthat the amendment did not apply to her case because\nher crimes both pre-dated the amendment and did not\ninvolve sexual abuse. These arguments fly in the face\nof the statutory text, legislative history, this Court’s\noun decisions, and the persuasive authority of other\nCircuits. The charges fell squarely within the amended\nstatute of limitations, and this Court should affirm\nJudge Nathan’s well-reasoned decisions denying Max-\nwell’s motions to dismiss the charges as untimely.\nA. Applicable Law\n\nl. Standard of Review\n\nThis Court reviews de novo both the denial of a mo-\ntion to dismiss an indictment and the application of a\nstatute of limitations. United States v. Sampson, 898\nF.3d 27o, 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021698.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page5l of 93\n38\n\ncertain discrimination claims, and held that applying\nthe new statute in a case “filed after its enactment, but\narising out of events that predate its enactment,” is not\nimpermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-\n9o. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct to which the\nstatute of limitations applies is not the primary con-\nduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but\nis instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the\nfiling of their suit.” Jd. at 89o. The 2oo3 amendment to\nSection 3283 likewise applies only to the secondary\nconduct of filing a criminal case; it does not apply to\nthe primary conduct of Maxwell’s child sexual abuse\nby, for example, modifying the elements of an offense\nto criminalize conduct that previously had not consti-\ntuted a crime. See id. at 89l (“Landgraf and other\ncases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif-\nferently from statutory provisions that affect substan-\ntive rights.”). Thus, like the new statute in Vernon, the\n2oo3 amendment “impaired no rights possessed by ei-\nther party, increased neither party’s liability, nor im-\nposed any new duties with respect to past transac-\ntions.” Id. at 89o.\n\nEnterprise does not alter this conclusion. There,\nthis Court considered whether an amended statute of\nlimitations operated to “revive already expired securi-\nties fraud claims.” Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o5. While\nacknouledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-\ncation of a revised statute of limitations generally does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the\nCourt <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “the resurrection of previously\ntime-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive\neffect.” Id. at 4o9-lo (emphasis removed). Enterprise\nhas no application here, as the limitations period for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l698\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021699.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page52 of 93\n39\n\nthe charges against Maxwell did not expire before the\nstatute of limitations was extended. Thus, unlike En-\nterprise, where resurrection of expired claims would\nhave “stripp[ed] [defendants] of a complete affirmative\ndefense they previously possessed,” id. at 4lo, here\nMaxwell never possessed that complete defense. Judge\nNathan correctly <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the 2oo3 amendment\naccordingly “did not deprive [Maxwell] of any vested\nrights.” (A.l53).\n\nTo be sure, this Court has observed that there may\nbe “colorable arguments” that “the logic of Enterprise\nextends to criminal cases where the defendant’s stat-\nute of limitations defense had not vested when the lim-\nitations period was extended” because the extension\n“increases the period of time during which a defend-\nant can be sued,’ thereby ‘increasing a defendant’s lia-\nbility for past conduct.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57\n(quoting Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4lo); see also United\nStates v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 644-46 (lst Cir. 2ol8)\n(discussing potential defense arguments). But such a\nclaim runs headlong into “the vast weight of retroac-\ntivity decisions,” which recognize that “revoking a\nvested statute of limitations defense is different from\nretroactively extending the filing period for a still-via-\nble claim.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57 (collecting\ncases).\n\nFor example, “in the criminal context, there is a\nconsensus that extending a limitations period before\nprosecution is time-barred does not run afoul of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution.” Cruz v. Maypa,\n773 F.3d l38, l45 (4th Cir. 2ol4); see also Stogner, 539\nU.S. at 632 (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021705.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page58 of 93\n45\n\nillustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher  v.\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. l42, l62 (2ol2)\n(citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3\n(2oo8)). And the text of Section 3283 goes even further\nbeyond the definition provided in Section 35o9 by cov-\nering any crime “involving” the sexual abuse of a child.\nCongress therefore did not require that a particular\nstatute have actual sexual contact with a minor as an\nelement of its offense, but rather swept broadly to\ncover any crime that in any way involves sexual abuse\nas broadly defined. Given this expansive language,\nsexual abuse “as defined here encompasses a wider set\nof behavior than just rape or other unwanted sexual\ntouching.” United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl97 (8d Cir. 2ol5). Thus, courts throughout the coun-\ntry have <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Section 3283 applies to a vari-\nety of offenses that do not require “a sexual act be-\ntween a defendant and a specific child,” United States\nv. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA), 2ol4 WL l838255, at\n*ll (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), or “physical contact with\nthe victim,” Carpenter, 68o F.3d at llo3; accord\nUnited States v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 7l4, 72o (5th Cir.\n2ol5).\n\nSection 3283’s definition thus captures crimes of in-\ntent where a perpetrator seeks to have a minor engage\nin sexual contact even if such sexual contact does not\noccur. Transportation of a minor with intent to engage\nin an illegal sex act (as charged in Count Four) and\nconspiracy to commit the same (as charged in Count\nThree) fall comfortably within that definition. Even\nthough a completed sex act is not required to commit\nthose two crimes, Count Four has “sexual abuse” as an\nelement because it requires the defendant to\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021709.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page62 of 93\n49\ncontact with a child. Counts Three and Four each have\nan “essential ingredient” that fits within that broad\ndefinition. See supra Point II.B.2.a.\n\nFinally, neither Dieh! nor United States v. Coun-\ntentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll), supports the use\nof a categorical approach. (Br.5l-52). In each decision,\nthe court <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Section 3283 applied to the\nsubject offenses without considering the specific facts\nof the crime, but in neither case did the court consider\nwhether a categorical approach was required—let\nalone hold that it was.\n\nAs noted above, it is undisputed that the evidence\nat trial established that Maxwell’s commission of\nCounts Three and Four involved completed sex acts\nabusing one or more minor victims: Jane testified that\nshe was in fact sexually abused when transported\nacross state lines, including to New York, as a minor.\nAccordingly, Counts Three and Four qualify as of-\nfenses involving the sexual abuse of a child both by\ntheir statutory terms and based on the specific facts of\nthis case.\n\nPOINT Ill\nThe District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in\nConcluding that Juror 5o Could Be Fair and\nImpartial Notwithstanding His Inadvertent\nMistakes on His Juror Questionnaire\n\nMaxwell contends that she was denied her right to\na fair and impartial jury because a juror failed to dis-\nclose during voir dire that he was sexually abused as a\nchild, and therefore incorrectly answered three\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021710.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page63 of 93\n5o\n\nquestions on his writen questionnaire. After an exten-\nsive hearing, Judge Nathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the juror’s\nerror was inadvertent, and in any event, she would not\nhave struck the juror for cause had he answered those\nquestion accurately because he was not biased in any\nway against Maxwell and was qualified to serve as a\njuror. Judge Nathan therefore found that Maxwell\nfailed to meet the high bar for a new trial and denied\nher motion. This Court should affirm that careful de-\ntermination.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nIn November 2o2l, in advance of trial, 694 jurors\ncompleted a juror questionnaire approved by the Dis-\ntrict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and consisted of 5l questions, many of\nwhich contained subparts. (A.29o-3l7). After the par-\nties reviewed the questionnaires, 23l of the 694 pro-\nceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court\nthen examined prospective jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury questionnaire that prospective\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the prospective jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court\nqualified 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.7l7). Of the 58 indi-\nviduals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight in-\ndividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-\ntionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021715.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page68 of 93\n55\n\nand therefore was not asked any questions about sex-\nual abuse. At the hearing, Judge Nathan examined Ju-\nror 5o in detail, and Juror 5o emphasized that his ex-\nperiences did not affect his ability to be fair and impar-\ntial, his ability to fairly assess the credibility of victim-\nwitnesses, or his ability to impartially judge Maxwell’s\nguilt. (A.268, 27o, 276-77).\n\n4. The District Court’s Decision\n\nJudge Nathan denied Maxwell’s motion for a new\ntrial in a detailed writen opinion. (A.3l8). First,\nJudge Nathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that Juror 5o’s answers were\nnot deliberately inaccurate, crediting Juror 5o’s testi-\nmony in light of his demeanor and consistent, logical\nanswers to her questions. (A.333-35). Second, Judge\nNathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that she would not have granted a\nfor-cause challenge to Juror 5o had he provided accu-\nrate information. At the hearing, Judge Nathan asked\nJuror 5o the questions she asked other jurors who in-\ndicated a personal experience with sexual assault or\nabuse. She <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “Juror 5o’s credible re-\nsponses [to those questions] under oath at the hearing\nestablished that he would not have been struck for\ncause if he had provided accurate responses to the\nquestionnaire.” (A.34o). As Judge Nathan explained,\nother jurors who answered the questions similarly\nwere not even challenged for cause, and she would not\nhave granted a challenge had one been made. (A.344-\n45). She also rejected the notion that mere similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s life experiences and the issues at\ntrial required her to excuse Juror 5o for cause. (A.346).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021720.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page73 of 93\n6o\n\nprosecuted for false testimony at the hearing (id.), and\nhad he hidden his sexual abuse in order to get on the\njury, he would not have immediately disclosed it to the\nmedia after trial (A.335). To the contrary, in one video\ninterview with the media, Juror 5o “appears genuinely\nand completely surprised to learn that the question-\nnaire” asked about his history of sexual abuse. (/d.).\n\nMaxwell does not directly challenge Judge Na-\nthan’s factual findings on this point, much less demon-\nstrate that they are clearly erroneous. Instead, relying\non United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.\nl993), Maxwell argues that McDonough’s first step is\nsatisfied by any falsehood, deliberate or otherwise.\n(Br.66).\n\nThis argument misses the mark. This prong re-\nquires a shouing of deliberate dishonesty by the juror,\nrather than mere honest mistake. This Court has ex-\nplained that, in McDonough, the Supreme Court\n“found that the juror’s good faith failure to respond,\nthough mistaken, did not satisfy even the first prong\nof the test.” United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5\n(2d Cir. l994). The defendant in Shaoul also relied on\nLangford to contend that a new trial was appropriate\n“even if he cannot establish the juror’s dishonesty.” Id.\nThis Court rejected that argument, concluding that\n“Is]uch a contorted reading of Langford is incorrect, be-\ncause it would eliminate the threshold requirement of\nthe McDonough test: juror dishonesty.” Id. And this\nCourt <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that the defendant failed to satisfy\nthe first prong of the test because “defense counsel ex-\nplicitly conceded the good faith of the juror.” Jd. at 8l6;\nsee United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l72o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021738.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page9l of 93\n78\nrange of l88 to 235 months’ imprisonment, Judge Na-\nthan “failed to provide reasons for its upward vari-\nance.” (Br.84). Maxwell’s one-sentence argument is so\ncursory and undeveloped that it should be deemed\nwaived. See United States v. Boti, 7ll F.3d 299, 3l3\n(2d Cir. 2ol8) (“It is a setled appellate rule that issues\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\nby some effort at developed argumentation, are\ndeemed waived.”). In any event, Judge Nathan en-\ngaged in a lengthy discussion of the sentencing factors\nwhen imposing sentence, including Maxwell’s “pivotal\nrole” in “heinous and predatory” sexual abuse of minor\ngirls. (SA459). In describing the seriousness of the of-\nfense, Judge Nathan found Maxwell’s crimes to be\nboth “extensive” and far-reaching” and <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that\n“the damage done to these young girls was incalcula-\nble,” as a result of “the painful, horrific, and lasting\nimpact of [the] trauma” they endured. (SA46o). After\nan extensive discussion of Maxwell’s horrifying crimes,\nJudge Nathan explained that this conduct “demands a\nsubstantial sentence that meets the scope of the con-\nduct and the scope of the harm,” and that the sentence\nmust “send an unmistakable message” of general de-\nterrence to “those who engage in and facilitate the sex-\nual abuse and trafficking of underage victims” that\n“nobody is above the law.” (SA46l). Accordingly, Judge\nNathan <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that “a very serious, a very signifi-\ncant sentence is necessary to achieve the purposes of\npunishment” under l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a). (SA462). This\ndiscussion belies any claim that Judge Nathan inade-\nquately explained the sentence.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021837.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel3 of 5l\n\nIn Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment in the\nEDNY with conspiring to import, importing, and possessing heroin with intent to\ndistribute. See 77l F.2d at 67l. After they pled guilty to the substantive importation\ncharge (Count Two), the prosecutor represented to the court that “the only agreement\nthat exists between defendants and the Government is that at the time of the\nimposition of sentence on Count Two, the Government would move to dismiss the\ntwo open remaining counts...” Jd. Accordingly, the conspiracy and possession\ncounts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were indicted in the\nSDNY with conspiracy to distribute heroin. See id. Whereas the dismissed EDNY\ncharges had only alleged a conspiracy on or about a date in l982, the new SDNY\ncharges alleged criminal conduct extending from l982 to l985.

See id. The Second Circuit noted that this result was highly counterintuitive,\nacknouledging that “[a] plea agreement whereby a federal prosecutor agrees that\n‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment...might be thought to bar the\nUnited States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district....”\nId. at 672.

In reaching that holding, the Circuit\nexplained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might\nhave documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule l6’s disclosure requirements are cabined\nto anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the\ndefendant.” /d. at lo36 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F.

According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting.

During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC.

In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span>, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we <span class=\"highlight\">concluded</span> that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024228.jpg": "|\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK |\nUNITED STATES SOURTHOUSE\n5oo PEARL STREET\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK looo7\n\n(2l2) 8o5-67l5 |\nCHAMBERS OF\nRICHARD M.
