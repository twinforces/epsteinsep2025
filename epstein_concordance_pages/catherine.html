The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt.

ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the\nGovernment's leter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated\nthat it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure. Houever, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8\nweeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,\nwhich are not voluminous, to the defense by March l2, 2o2l. Disclosure of the\nmaterials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see\nDkt. No. 36.

STERNHEIAA\n\nStates District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered a semi-anonymous jury (jurors\nwere publicly referred to by number only) and released the names of all potential jurors to\ncounsel, plus all pro se defendants (including Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell), who\nare allegedly prominent white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the leaders of hate groups that\nplanned, promoted, and executed the violent acts in Charlotesville. (See Exhibit A, annexed.)\nThe defendants in Sines included factions of the Ku Klux Klan. The concerns for juror privacy in\nSines dwarf any conceivable concerns in this case and Sines is also the subject of extensive\nongoing publicity. We submit that withholding the names of 6oo jurors until the day of jury\nselection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury and is a\nprocedure that would violate due process in this particular case.!\n\n“An impartial jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of\ninterest and bias.” United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, ll (2d Cir. 2ol5). In Parse, a case\nbefore Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and\nthree of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86.\nAfter trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground\nthat one of the jurors, Juror No. l (<span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> M. Conrad), “had lied and withheld material\ninformation during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley appointed Bobbi\nC. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror\nwas examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867\nF.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2ol2) found it “undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire\nand concealed important information about her background” (id. at 45l), her level of education,\nplace of residence, criminal history, and other maters. Parse, 789 F.33 at 87-9o.\n\n' We are unaware of any other recent high-profile case in which a writen juror questionnaire was\nused and the Court withheld the names of the jurors from counsel follouing the completion of\nthe questionnaires.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009228.jpg": "Case (2o3ct2oo336o; PAEUm Boctiment 6o6/2ol Filedawe4a/22geRagee of 67\niv\nPAGE\n\nTranscript—Trial, Day 47, May 23, 2oll ...................ooo22+-.

All right. Well, let's talk about the pre voir dire stage.\n2 Nou, your firm received the juror list from the juror clerk,\n3 correct?\n4 A. That's my understanding, yes.\n5 Q. And your team analyzed it and other information that you\n6 all had gathered at that point, correct?\nHi A.

And in fact, Theresa Trzaskoma told you and shoued you that\n2o epinion prior to the start of voir dire, correct?\n2l A. I don't think it was prior to the start of voir dire, but\n22 it was in the morning before court, maybe some point mid-voir\n23 dire, and I don't knou that she shoued it to me, but we\n24 certainly discussed it in the presence of Dennis Donahue, the\n25 jury consultant.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.Cc.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009323.jpg": "Case l€2oser4oo336 AecurDact a at 9 Q FiledG@zear PagPage 34 of l3o\n262\nC2GFDAUl Brune - direct\n\naf Q. What were those discussions?\n\n2 A. We didn't have really any information about <span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span>\n\n3 Conrad. And I think it was sort of not on the list to search\n\n4 because it was sort of a common name, and Theresa explained,\n\n5 and I can't do this verbatim because at the time this was not\n\n6 such a huge event, but I think Theresa explained that she had\n\n7 goten on Google, that she had found that there was a suspended\n8 lawyer with the name <span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> Conrad and we were going to be\n\n9 doing voir dire of this <span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> Conrad that day. So we\n\nlo talked about it with the jury consultant, and I said something\nua to the jury consultant to the effect of, wou, this is very\n\nl2 interesting and odd, because the trial is going to be about the\nl3 law of economic substance and virtually every defendant in the\nl4 case has a law degree, and so which way does that cut?\n\nl5 And my best recollection is that the jury consultant\nl6 said you do not want this lady on your jury because a\n\nl} recovering alcoholic tends to be all about taking and imposing\nl8 personal responsibility and that she'll be more focused on that\nl9 than on the government's burden of proof, so if this is the\n2o same person you should strike her for cause and if that doesn't\na work you should get her off with a peremptory.\n22 Q. Nou, this opinion that your firm had in its hand had not\n23 just a first name and last name but a middle initial, correct?\n24 A. When you say in hand, I don't knou that I ever saw the\n25 thing and I certainly never saw a printout.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

My opinion is based on the cited documents and I assume as true the facts that emerge\nfrom the sworn testimony at the hearing held February l5 and l6, 2ol2. I note that the testimony\nat that hearing was subject to robust adverse direct examination by Government atorneys.\n. General Observations And Legal Standards\n\n6. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct (hereafter “New York Rules”) specifically\nidentify when a lawyer is obligated to disclose information to the Court. The New York Rules\nare incorporated in the local rules of this Court. See Southern District of New York Local Rule\nl.5(b)(5).\n7. Relevant here is New York Rule 3.3(a) and (b), which provides:\n\n(a) A lawyer shall not knouingly: (l) make a false statement of fact or law to a\n\ntribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9448", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009455.jpg": "Case l{2oser4oo33o& ABcurDoecureat 6lo9/2o Filed G@z2ah PagPaged 36 of ll7\n‘A-585l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 9 of 29\nThe Court: All right.

I think it’s more appropriate.\n29. This colloquy must be read in its (rather brief) entirety, that is, as a whole. Trzaskoma’s\nstatement implies that the answer to the Court’s question from Brune & Richard would not be\nthat it had no information at all. It would not require a leter to say only that. It is, instead, clear\nthat Trzakoma had something “additional...to offer,” and chose to accept the Court’s invitation\nto say it in a leter, which was done on July 2l in a fashion that adequately disclosed the firm’s\nearlier research and internal communications on the subject. “The general rule is that statements\nmust be taken in context, and that related parts of a document must be taken together. That a\nhasty reader might take the first paragraph out of context is not in the present circumstances\nenough to brand the memorandum as false.” The memorandum must be “read as a whole.”\nYoung v.

For the reasons stated, my opinion is that the actions of the Brune & Richard lawyers\nthroughout the trial and in the months follouing with respect to the information they had\nobtained about <span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> Conrad were entirely consistent with their responsibilities under the\nlawyer ethics rules.\n; stone Gillers\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9455", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009494.jpg": "Case Ma2ssor-oo33o°P ABourDeouRigat Bee ° FilledQngeah? agPage 45 of ll7\nl6\nCAC3PARC\n\nl MS.

And the Nardello firm provided to you the results of the\nl2 research that it was asked to do prior to the start of voir\nl dire, correct?\nl4 A, That's right.\nl5 Q.

So we\n\nlo talked about it with the jury consultant, and I said something\nua to the jury consultant to the effect of, wou, this is very\n\nl2 interesting and odd, because the trial is going to be about the\nl3 law of economic substance and virtually every defendant in the\nl4 case has a law degree, and so which way does that cut?\n\nLS And my best recollection is that the jury consultant\nl6 said you do not want this lady on your jury because a\n\nl} recovering alcoholic tends to be all about taking and imposing\nl8 personal responsibility and that she'll be more focused on that\nl9 than on the government's burden of proof, so if this is the\n2o same person you should strike her for cause and if that doesn't\na work you should get her off with a peremptory.\n22 Q. Nou, this opinion that your firm had in its hand had not\n23 just a first name and last name but a middle initial, correct?\n24 A.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a subsequent re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ).

That is not a question of legal ethics.\n3. In summary, my opinion is that (i) the Brune & Richard lawyers had no ethical obligation\nto disclose the results of their March 2oll research in March, or the results of their March and\nMay 2oll research in May; (i) the Brune & Richard lawyers had no ethical obligation to ,\ndisclose the existence or the results of their March and May research in their July 8 motion for a\nnew trial or during the July l5 conference call with the Court; and (i) nothing the Brune &\nRichard lawyers said or did in the July 8 memorandum or the July l5 conference call violated\ntheir ethical obligations.\n\nFactual Assumptions\n4. I have read the follouing documents: -\n--<span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> Conrad’s leter to the Government dated May 25, 2oll;\n--Defendants’ Brief in Support of a New Trial dated July 8.2oll;\n--Transcript of Telephone Conference with Court dated July l5, 2oll; .\n--Leter from Susan Brune dated July 2l, 2oll;\n--Leter from Susan Brune dated July 29, 2oll;\n--Affidavit of Susan Brune with Exhibits (including <span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> Conrad’s jury questionnaire and\nvoir dire responses) dated September l5, 2oll;\n--Government’s Waiver Brief dated October 7, 2oll;\n--Defendant Parse’s Waiver Brief dated October 27,2oll; and -\n--Transcript of Hearing dated February l5 and l6, 2ol2.\n5. My opinion is based on the cited documents and I assume as true the facts that emerge\nfrom the sworn testimony at the hearing held February l5 and l6, 2ol2. I note that the testimony\nat that hearing was subject to robust adverse direct examination by Government atorneys.\n. General Observations And Legal Standards\n\n6. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct (hereafter “New York Rules”) specifically\nidentify when a lawyer is obligated to disclose information to the Court. The New York Rules\nare incorporated in the local rules of this Court. See Southern District of New York Local Rule\nl.5(b)(5).\n7. Relevant here is New York Rule 3.3(a) and (b), which provides:\n\n(a) A lawyer shall not knouingly: (l) make a false statement of fact or law to a\n\ntribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010134.jpg": "Cada it 2o2 Or enockkeeD AS NL eminent G6 S32 Aiba OOP Rak ays BSF afll/l 7\nA-585l\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 9 of 29\nThe Court: All right.

I think it’s more appropriate.\n29. This colloquy must be read in its (rather brief) entirety, that is, as a whole. Trzaskoma’s\nstatement implies that the answer to the Court’s question from Brune & Richard would not be\nthat it had no information at all. It would not require a leter to say only that. It is, instead, clear\nthat Trzakoma had something “additional...to offer,” and chose to accept the Court’s invitation\nto say it in a leter, which was done on July 2l in a fashion that adequately disclosed the firm’s\nearlier research and internal communications on the subject. “The general rule is that statements\nmust be taken in context, and that related parts of a document must be taken together. That a\nhasty reader might take the first paragraph out of context is not in the present circumstances\nenough to brand the memorandum as false.” The memorandum must be “read as a whole.”\nYoung v. City of Providence, 4o4 F.3d 33, 4o-4l (l* Cir. 2oo5) (Rule ll appeal) (citations\nomited).\nCONCLUSION\n3o. For the reasons stated, my opinion is that the actions of the Brune & Richard lawyers\nthroughout the trial and in the months follouing with respect to the information they had\nobtained about <span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> Conrad were entirely consistent with their responsibilities under the\nlawyer ethics rules.\n; stone Gillers\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010173.jpg": "cee ee eee et OTR ne wamuesiSraria7\nl6\nCAC3PARC\n\nl MS.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-l426\nDear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe,\n\nIam appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell. I was not trial counsel\nfor Ms. Maxwell. I filed an Acknouledgement and Notice of Appearance on July l5, 2o22. The\nClerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any\ninformation concerning the transcripts.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), the ready date for this case was July l5, 2o22.\nAccordingly, I have until July 29, 2o22, to file this briefing schedule request. Pursuant to Local\nRule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), I can request no more than 9l days from the ready date as the deadline for\nfiling Appellant’s Brief. That date would be October l4, 2o22.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(D), houever, I am permited to request a later deadline\nto file Appellant’s Brief ifthe case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.\nI request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 3o, 2o23, for the\nfollouing reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions identified by the rule. First, as noted,\nI am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week. As\nnew counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to\nprovide my client with the most competent and effective representation on appeal. Second, the\nrecord is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of transcript including pretrial hearings,\nvoir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists\nof 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in\nlimine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct\nmy oun research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance\nof prevailing on appeal. This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size\nof Appellant’s Brief. Fourth, I have not been able to meet with my client as she was prematurely\ntransferred to Tallahassee, Florida by the Federal Bureau of Prisons over this past weekend, a\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o596", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020599.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 37, o8/ol/2o22, 33575o8, Page‘ of l\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE\nSECOND CIRCUIT\nAt a Stated Term of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held at the\nThurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Foley Square, in the City of New York, on the\nlst day of August, two thousand twenty-two.\nBefore: Jose A.

Ghislaine Maxwell,\nDocket No. 22-l426\nArgument date: March l2, 2o23\nDear Ms. Wolfe:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 28(), to inform this Court of United States v. Watkins, 94o F.3d\nl52 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nIn Watkins, this Court explained that the portion of the Bail Reform Act, l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42()(l)(E), that required a detention hearing for “any felony .. . that in-\nvolves a minor victim ... .” permits a court to conduct a “conduct-specific inquiry in\nwhich the judicial officer may look beyond the elements of the charged offense to con-\nsider the actual conduct underlying the arrestee’s charged offense.” 94o F.3d at l65,\nl67. Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it “suggest[s] factual details\nsurrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at l66. The Court also noted the absence of a\ntextual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at l66\nn.7o. The Court further explained that its conclusion was reinforced by legislative\nhistory, namely, the inclusion of Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) in a statute intended to “afford\nminor victims of crime the greatest degree of protection.” Id. at l66.\n\nThe Court contrasted Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) with another portion of the Act that\ncontains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because\nthat text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime, an ‘offense, and a ‘felony,” indicating an em-\nphasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id. (quoting l8\nU.S.C. § 3l82(f)(l) (discussing “a case that involves ...a crime of violence . . .”); see\nid. at l62-65.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021791.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lol, o3/lo/2o24, 36l4237, Page2 of 2\n<span class=\"highlight\">Catherine</span> O’Hagan Wolfe\nMarch lo, 2o23\nPage 2 of 2\nThe same principles apply to the statute of limitations at issue here. (See Gov.\nBr. 42-49). That statute covers an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse...\nof a child,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), which similarly “suggests factual details sur-\nrounding the charged conduct” and lacks language like “has as an element.” And it\nis also part of a statute intended to afford broader protections for minor victims of\ncrimes.

United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7).\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: /s/\nAndrew Rohrbach\nMaurene Comey\nLara Pomerantz\nHagan Scoten\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nTel: (2l2) 637-l944\ncc: Diana Fabi Samson, Esq.
