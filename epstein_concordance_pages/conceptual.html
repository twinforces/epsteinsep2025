These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and <span class=\"highlight\">conceptual</span> prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. <span class=\"highlight\">Conceptual</span> analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, <span class=\"highlight\">conceptual</span> analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a <span class=\"highlight\">conceptual</span> model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and <span class=\"highlight\">conceptual</span> prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. <span class=\"highlight\">Conceptual</span> analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, <span class=\"highlight\">conceptual</span> analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a <span class=\"highlight\">conceptual</span> model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.
