Intervenor has witnessed the\nsame patern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his oun case; and has nou identified the same\nconspiracy at work in this case.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\ne intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2ol2/2ol3,\nintervenor filed a whistleblouer complaint with the Washington State Auditor’s Office. The\ncomplaint was escalated to Michael Horouitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A\nCase l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the\ncomplaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges\nthat Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered\nthat State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could\nlaunder $7o billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through |\nintervenor’s atorneyz.\n\ne On l2/27/l9, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the\nFalse Claims Act, seeking $l billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”,\nRepublicans, and his former atorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)).\n\ne On5/l/l3, USDO! submited a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor’s claim (See EXHIBIT C Case\nl:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor’s allegations\n“lack sufficient factual and legal support.”\n\ne oOn5/l3/l9, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ atorneys\nfor conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration).\n\ne On5/l4/l9, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct.,\nafter fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case l:l9-CR-\noo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration).\n\nDAVID GOLDEN\nl5l5l NW MASON HILL RD\nNORTH PLAINS, OR 97l33\nMOTION TG <span class=\"highlight\">INTERVENE</span> - 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo634", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000635.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document5l- Filed o8/27/l9 Page 3of4\n® On 5/l5/l9, Intervenor had his petition for quo warranto against USDOJ for fraud/ obstruction/\nperjury dismissed as “moot” (See EXHIBIT F Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by\nDeclaration}.\n© On6/6/l9, intervenor identified the conspiracy (the same conspiracy at work in this case) to the\nDistrict Ct.

Intervenor also indicated that he intended to write about USDOI’s\nunlimited “prosecutorial discretion” to fraudulently dismiss False Claims complaints, as this\n“prosecutorial discretion” was the same “prosecutorial discretion” exercised by USDOJ and Alex\nAcosta in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Intervenor also atached an article by the former Deputy\nAtorney General of the United States (Donald Ayer), indicating that Barr was a “fierce advocate of |\nunchecked presidential pouer”.

Intervenor has been denied these rights so that the conspiracy can continue\nlaundering tax money.

On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of ail\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No, 2o-33o (S.D.N.Y.). We\nare concerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #6l at 2 (emphasis added).)\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personaily identifiable information,\nsuch as information about the former defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while\nwe join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make\nthis narrou independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of\nwithholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust lo, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter” or “Def. Ltr.”), requesting that the Court order the\nGovernment to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses ll months prior to trial, and\nrequesting that the Court <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the\nGovernment somehou delayed that initial production is nonsense.

These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that\ndefense counsel has located where [a\nee\nee\nCSC‘\nee\nThat Ms. Maxwell did not knou what was in the sealed materials before she signed the\nProtective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(l) authorizes the Court to\nregulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline\nBeecham Corp. v. Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., 2lo F.R.D. l63, l66 (M.D.N.C. 2oo2)\n(“[c]ourts have the inherent pouer to modify protective orders, including protective orders\narising from a stipulation by the parties”); see also United States v.

Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 7\n\nThe BOP, for their part, has only exacerbated these problems. For example, on a legal\nvisit today to review images on a laptop computer provided by the Government, we were told\nthat we could not sit on the same side of the table as Ms. Maxwell to review the images\nsimultaneously. Instead, we were directed by MDC prison guards to sit across from Ms.\nMaxwell, such that we could not see what she was reviewing or meaningfully discuss the\nmaterials.\n\nTo compound the problem, we were told by the team leader that defense counsel would\nnot be permited to pass Ms. Maxwell papers for her to review or sign. This required a break in\nthe meeting so that defense counsel could call the prosecutors to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>. The prosecutors\nagreed to call the MDC to ensure that defense counsel could pass legal papers to Ms. Maxwell.\nBut that message was clearly not received by the MDC. After returning to the MDC, we were\ntold that we could pass Ms. Maxwell only documents that required her signature, but not\ndocuments that needed her review. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to participate in her defense\nand adequately prepare for trial if she cannot review documents prepared by her atorneys.\nAccordingly, we ask the Court to order the BOP to allou defense counsel to pass legal papers to\nMs. Maxwell for her review during prison visits.\n\nThe Government cannot discharge its discovery obligations by partially completing them.\nThe Government must fully complete them and do so on the deadlines they agreed to with the\nCourt. And it goes without saying that the Government cannot discharge its discovery\nobligations by producing the discovery to defense counsel. Ms. Maxwell has a right to review all\nthe discovery to participate in her oun defense. As such, she must have a complete set of\nreadable discovery in the MDC, which she does not have. The Government has created these\nproblems by insisting on detention prior to trial. It is their burden to fix them.\n\nThe Government has not requested any relief in its leter of October 7, 2o2o. Ms.\nMaxwell anticipates that once the Government responds to her discovery requests and after\nfurther conferrals the parties will be in a beter position to seek relief from the Court. It may be\nappropriate for the Court to schedule a status conference after November 9 to consider these\nissues.\n\nRespectfully Submited,\nJeffr¢y S.

They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.

On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public.

After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.

Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\n: A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2878", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003018.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 239\nprocess, the inference that the defendant urges this Court to draw—that the Government delayed\nseeking an indictment to gain a tactical advantage and did so through strategy in the pending civil\nlitigation—is both unsupported by the record and illogical.\n\nThe defendant makes much of the Government having moved to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and stay the\nproceedings in Doe v. Indyke, No. 2o Civ. 484 (JGK), while the Government has not moved to\nstay Giuffre v. Maxwell. (Def. Mot. 7 at l6-l9). She suggests that there is some “sharp contrast”\nbetween the Government’s actions in the various civil maters, which “establish a strong inference\nthat as long as the government stood to gain a tactical advantage by delaying the indictment. . ., it\nwould not move to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>.” (/d. at l9). Seting the defendant’s conspiracy theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, Giuffre v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the determination of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more discovery to be\nconducted in the Giuffre case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, discovery was just beginning, and if discovery were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case. Such concerns are not present in Giuffre v. Maxwell.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 239\npublic interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious\ncrime.

The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world.

Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting.

Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 333 of 348\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.” !*\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!4? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,’ which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'“4 When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struack—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l88 of 349\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 334 of 349\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

See Press Enterprise Co. v.\nSuperior Court of California, 464 U.S. 5ol, 5o8 (l984) (“Press Enterprise I’). The presumption\nof openness can only be overcome if “specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating\nthat closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that\ninterest.” Press—Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, l3-l4 (l986) (“Press-Enterprise\nIl’). Under this standard, the presumption in favor of access to court proceedings and records\nrequires \"the most compelling circumstances\" to justify any restriction upon that right. In re\nApplication of Nat'l B'casting Co., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o).\n\nThe reasons why the documents in question should be unsealed have been clearly set\nforth in the submissions by the other media entities. The Daily News would simply emphasize\nthat the right of access applies fully to post-trial proceedings, including motions for a new trial\nand accompanying exhibits and memoranda. See, e.g., United States v. Donato, 7l4 F. App’x\n75, 76 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (concluding that documents atached to motion for a new\ntrial were judicial documents subject to right of access and holding that district court abused its\ndiscretion in refusing to unseal documents); United States v. Gonzalez, 927 F. Supp. 768, 784\n(D.

(“ABC News”) and\nNBCuUniversal News Group (“NBC News”) to join in the requests of The Miami Herald (Dkt.\nNo. 58l) and The New York Times to oppose the sealing of the motion for a new trial and\nsupporting exhibits filed by the Defendant (Dkt.

Nos. 575 & 576) was e-mailed to\nthe Court and placed under temporary seal, nou be unsealed. Like the Defendant’s Motion for a\nNew Trial, Juror 5o’s motion is a “judicial document” to which the presumption of access under\nboth the common law and the First Amendment applies because Juror 5o’s motion has been, and\ncontinues to be, highly “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the\nJudicial process.” U.S. v.

Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The right of\naccess exists primarily because “public monitoring [of courts] is an essential feature of\ndemocratic control”. Amodeo IT, 7l F.3d at lo48. “[W]ithout access to testimony and\ndocuments that are used in the performance of Article III functions”, it is not possible to\neffectively understand and monitor the proceedings in this case that relate to Juror 5o’s motion as\nthey take place. Id.\n\nFinally, for many of the same reasons supporting access to Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial, it appears unlikely there is “a substantial probability of harm to a compelling interest” that\nwould result from placing Juror 5o’s motion on the public docket. See Under Seal v. Under Seal,\n273 F. Supp. 3d 46o, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“A proponent of sealing may overcome the\npresumption of access by demonstrating a substantial probability of harm to a compelling\ninterest.”). Juror No. 5o’s privacy interest is particularly lou here, given that he has voluntarily\ndisclosed his identity and history in various interviews. See In re Application to Unseal 98 Cr.\nLIOlI(ILG), 89l F. Supp. 2d 296, 3oo (E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). And the Court has already solicited\nsubmissions from the parties regarding any proposed redactions, so the Court can assess whether\nthey may be discrete redactions, if any, that need be made to protect any other compelling\ninterest.\n\nFor all these reasons, ABC News and NBC News respectfully request that the Court\nunseal Defendant’s motion for a new trial and Juror No. 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>.\n\n4863-79l l-5787v.l ool99l8-oooo33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8845", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596_ Filed o2/ll/22 Pagelof7\nUSDCSDNY\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUnited States of America, |\n~—-\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the parties’ leters addressing the Defendant’s request to\ntemporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government’s\nresponse in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 59o, 594, 595. Several media\norganizations have also filed leters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s\nmotion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The\nDefendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 5o’s motion.\n\nFor the reasons outlined more fully belou, the Court rules as follous. First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions. Follouing the\nCourt’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if one is ordered, all redactions will be\npromptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596- Filed o2/ll/22 Page2of7\n\nSecond, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> as it is unnecessary and\nunsupported by any authority or precedent. Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. Temporary sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nBoth parties agree that the motion papers are “judicial document[s] that [are] subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and common law.” Dkt. No. 594\nat 2 (quoting Dkt. No. 59o at 4). Houever, the Defendant argues that sealing pending a hearing\nor resolution is necessary “to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process that may take\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page5of7\nOrder, via email on or before February l6, 2o22. Because this Order resolves the scope of\nredactions for all filings related to the motion, the Court adjourns sine die the briefing schedule\npreviously set for the parties to justify any proposed sealing or redactions to the new trial motion\npapers. See Dkt. No. 585. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions so the filings can be\ndocketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which\nredactions are approved.\n\nAt the time the briefs are docketed with approved redactions, the Defendant is further\nORDERED to docket Exhibits 2 and 3 to her motion and the exhibit to her reply, and the\nGovernment ORDERED to docket all exhibits to its opposition, all of which are publicly\navailable documents.!\n\nI. Juror 5o Motion to <span class=\"highlight\">Intervene</span>\n\nThe Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, which both the Government\nand the Defense oppose. Defense Motion, at 5l-52; Government Response, at 44; see also\nDefense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22. The Court denies the motion. Juror 5o cites no authority to support\na juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> to assert First Amendment access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention. See,\ne.g., McCoy, No. l4 Cr. 6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329 at 6-7 (appointing counsel for juror alleged\nl Exhibit l to the Defendant’s motion, which is Juror 5o’s completed questionnaire, is to be maintained temporarily\nunder seal pending the Court’s ruling on whether a hearing will be held and on the New York Times Company’s\nmotion to unseal the filled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. Dkt. Nos. 583, 585. The Court will\naddress Juror 5o’s request that a copy of his questionnaire be released to his counsel at that time. The Court notes\nthat the voir dire transcript is currently available to the public.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page6eof7\nto have falsely represented information on pre-selection questionnaire and during oral voir dire).\nJuror 5o is the potential subject of a post-verdict inquiry, not a party with an interest in the\ncriminal case. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”). The Defendant’s effort to liken the motion to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o8 _ Filed o2/24/22 Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n- against - NOTICE OF MOTION\n\nTO <span class=\"highlight\">INTERVENE</span> AND\nFOR THE RELEASE OF\nDOCUMENTS UNDER\nSEAL\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL Case No.: 2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n\nDefendant.\n\npenne nn nnn nnn enn ee ee eee K\n\nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Applicant in Intervention, Juror 5o (“Applicant”), hereby\nmoves the Court to grant him the right to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the above-captioned case for the purpose of\ndefending his significant and threatened privacy interests regarding his experience(s) as a survivor\nof past sexual assault.\n\nOn January 5, 2o22, this Court ordered the parties to submit briefs in which each shall\n“address whether an inquiry of some kind is permited and/or required, and, if so, the nature of\nsuch an inquiry”.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to <span class=\"highlight\">Intervene</span> in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page5ofl3\n\nIntervention in this action by Juror 5o would not prejudice either party to this action. If\ngranted, intervention would also not delay resolution of the issue subject to a possible inquiry, on\nthe merits.\n\nFor these reasons and those further set forth belou, the technical requirements for\nintervention are satisfied here. Additionally, the principles of justice, fairness and common-sense\nweigh strongly in favor of allouing Juror 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>. As such, Juror 5o’s motion to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and for the release of the sealed Jury Questionnaire and voir dire materials should be\ngranted, as requested herein\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nJuror 5o served on the jury in the case sub judice, which reached a verdict on December\n29, 2o2l. After the verdict was reached Juror 5o gave interviews, which were reported in both\nprint media and televised news reports. In the media reporting on the interviews given by Juror\n5o, he is alleged to have discussed his personal experience(s) with sexual abuse. See Prosecution\nLeter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF # 568.\n\nOn this basis, and on the basis of information filed under seal, Defense Counsel sent a\nleter to Judge Nathan, which was also published in the media, claiming “incontrovertible\ngrounds for a new trial under rule 33”. See Defense Leter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF #569.\n\nThereafter, Judge Nathan issued an order giving Juror 5o the opportunity to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” and to submit a brief by\nJanuary 26, 2o22, if he determines that he does desire to be heard on such issue. Order at l. Jan.\n5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o.\n\nJuror 5o seeks a copy of his Jury Questionnaire, as he does not recall answering questions\nregarding his prior experience with sexual assault.

Juror 5o further desires\nto maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his\nexperience as the victim of prior sexual assault.\nTW. ARGUMENT\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should, in its proper exercise of discretion,\nallou Juror 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury\nQuestionnaire to his atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have\ncompelling and legitimate rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including\nprior sexual assaults. Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater. Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-\n33o.Therefore, by allouing Juror 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in this action, this Court can ensure that Juror\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8985", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page7ofl3\n5o will maintain his ability to protect his compelling and legitimate right to privacy, specifically\nregarding his prior history with sexual assault. Additionally, allouing Juror 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> will\nassist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry into the subject, by\nallouing his an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant issues. Moreover,\nthe interests of justice and judicial economy will be served if Juror 5o is permited to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> at\nthis point in time, as the same will allou Juror 5o to identify and assert any fifth amendment\nrights against self-incrimination before any hearing is held pursuant to an inquiry directed by the\nCourt.\nA. Juror 5o’s Request to <span class=\"highlight\">Intervene</span>\nl. Jurors have compelling and legitimate privacy rights.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has explicitly acknouledged that Jurors can have\n“compelling” and “legitimate” privacy interests that warrants sealing the record as to certain\nstatements given by the jurors. Press-Enter. Co. v Superior Ct. of California, Riverside County,\n464 US 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984)-. In Press-Enter. Co., the Supreme Court expressly determined that\nforcing an individual to disclose details of a sexual assault may justify holding closed hearings\nand sealing the record due to “the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very disclosure\nof the episode”. /d. In Press-Enter. Co., Chief Justice Burger further made clear that forced\ndisclosure of past sexual assault suffered by jurors gave rise to a “valid privacy right”. /d.\n\nIn United States v. King, the Second Circuit upheld the ruling by the louer court, which\nalloued parts of the record in that case to be sealed based on the jurors’ privacy interest in\nintensely personal subjects, as well as upheld the louer court’s finding that such interest was\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny King atracted from the press. United States v King, l4o\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8986", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Page8ofl3\nF3d 76, 79 (2d Cir l998) (Citing United States v. King, No. 94 Cr. 455, l998 WL 5o22l\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, l998)).\nMoreover, conclusion of the trial on which the subject juror served does not remove a\nJurors’ interest in privacy and protection from harassment. See United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d\nl2o2, l2lo-l2 (Sth Cir.l977).\nps Jurors may face criminal exposure for answers given on jury\nquestionnaires\nTo complete the jury questionnaire, jurors must swear to truthfully answer the same\nunder penalty of perjury; jurors are also placed under oath prior to answering questions in voir\ndire. See e.g., United States v Parse, 789 F3d 83, 88 (2d Cir 2ol5). A juror who knouingly\nsubmits false answers on the jury questionnaire and/or during voir dire testimony may expose\nhimself or herself to arrest and prosecution, while jurors also maintain a fifth amendment right\nagainst self-incrimination. /d., at 9l.\n3.

For example, courts have alloued\nthe press to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in criminal cases to assert the First Amendment rights of the Press.

Juror 5o’s Jury Questionnaire should be released to Counsel, but\notherwise remain under seal, to provide Juror 5o with a full and fair\nopportunity to present his position to this Court\nl. A copy of the Jury Questionnaire is necessary to comply with\nJudge Nathan’s January 5\" order\nIt is necessary for Juror 5o to review his answers to the Jury Questionnaire and the\ntranscript of his voir dire testimony, before he is able to comply with Judge Nathan’s order and\naddress the “appropriateness of an inquiry”, into his conduct and his truthfulness of his responses\non the Jury Questionnaire. See Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. It should go without saying\nthat Juror 5o needs to knou whether or not the question(s) related to prior sexual abuse were\nanswered by him correctly on his Jury Questionnaire to help determine what an appropriate\ninquiry would entail, so that the same would also Juror 5o’s privacy rights and legitimate\ninterests related to these maters.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8988", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl3\nBe The instance mater presents a compelling reason to release\nthe Jury Questionnaire to Counsel, under seal.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s privacy interest would normally prevent disclosure, those factors\ndo not apply to the release of the Jury Questionnaire and the voir dire transcript, under seal, to\nhis oun atorney. Such a release will allou Juror 5o to comply with Judge Nathan’s Order from\nJanuary o5, 2o22. Additionally, since the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript will remain\nunder seal, with the limited expectations requested herein, this Court need not be concerned\nabout the risks that may be posed by full disclosure of the same, and therefore does not need to\nconsider the risks of widespread disclosure in deciding the instant motion.\n\nWhile the court was right to seal the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript from the\npublic given the circumstances of the trial, the circumstances have changes since that time. Nou\nthat the Jury Questionnaire of Juror 5o specifically is at issue, Juror 5o’s atorney should be\ngranted access to the document under seal. The privacy concerns that favor limiting access to the\nJury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript by others do not apply to Juror 5o himself, given his\nunique involvement and personal role in the inquiry directed by the order of this Court. As such,\nthe balancing of the relevant factors strongly supports granting Juror 5o access to his oun Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of his voir dire testimony, under seal, especially in light of the\nunique facts and circumstance presented by this mater.\n\nIV.

And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion Sn\na is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. LF\nPO he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l38", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His Questionnaire Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas. See, e.g., City of Almaty,\nKazakhstan v. Ablyazov, No. l:l5 Civ. o5345 (AJN) (KHP), 2o2o WL ll3o67o, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 47 of 49\nMar. 9, 2o2o); Strike 3 Holdings, LLC v.

(Def. Mem. at 53-56). The cases cited by the defendant\nin support of its motion to strike are inapposite,”? and in any event Juror 5o’s motion, whether or\nnot ultimately granted, is hardly “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” The\ndefendant further claims that the pleadings are not “judicial documents” at the current stage of the\nproceedings as they have not been ruled upon by the Court and, therefore, “are afforded no\npresumption of public access.” (/d. at 54, 56). She is wrong.

The defendant also cites\ncivil cases involving discussions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f) under which “[a] court\nmay strike from a pleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous mater.” The\ndefendant ignores that even in that context, “motions to strike are disfavored and should not be\ngranted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.

Metzger v. Hussman, 682 F. Supp. llo9, llo (D. Nev. l988),\nwhich the defendant cites (Def. Mem. at 54), is also inapposite. Metzger is a civil case in which\nthe court granted a motion to strike an opposition to a motion to dismiss that was filed in an\nuntimely manner because “[a]pplicable rules of procedure . . . must be enforced in this case, as in\nany case, so that the Court may maintain control over the progress of litigation before it.” Metzger,\n682 F.

The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “discovery\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether discovery materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for discovery can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

The motion was submited by email to Chambers. In an Order\ndated January l2, 2o22, the Court directed the parties “to submit via email any proposed redactions\non or before January l3, 2o22, justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6).” The Government respectfully submits that no redactions are necessary, and accordingly\nthe motion should be publicly filed.\n\nThe defendant opposes any public filing of Juror 5o’s motion, arguing that it is not a\njudicial document. This argument is meritless. Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> is quite obviously\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United States\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9537", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l7 Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nv.

The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is premature”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“discovery request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his\nquestionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for discovery should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the questionnaire should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has identified no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual assault,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 58 of 66\nclaim.

Without relying on juror testimony, it is already clear\nthat Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer the questionnaire; Juror No. 5o has publicly\nadmited he is a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse.\n\nAs for identifying the other juror who was also a victim of sexual assault and\nabuse, the Court and parties can identify the juror without eliciting testimony about what\nwas said during deliberations. The remaining eleven jurors can be asked, under oath,\nwhether their answer to question 48 is correct and whether they have been a victim of\nsexual assault or abuse.

Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> for public access. See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> to assert the public’s First Amendment right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper).

Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure make no reference to a motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one court has noted, “[e]ven crime victims,\nwho enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have no right to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the\ndistrict court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL 478o927, at *l (E.D.\nWis. 2ol3).\n\nB. This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s discovery request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation.

Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v.

Nev. l988) (motion to strike granted and motion in opposition not considered by the\ncourt). This Court should strike all the filings made by Juror No. 5o.\n\nAlternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of\nMotion to <span class=\"highlight\">Intervene</span> and for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and Transcript, on\nBehalf of Proposed Intervenor, Juror 5o” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at\nleast until a resolution of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure\nto answer truthfully during jury selection. Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v.

Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995)\n(“We think that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9753", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His Questionnaire Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9842", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas. See, e.g., City of Almaty,\nKazakhstan v. Ablyazov, No. l:l5 Civ. o5345 (AJN) (KHP), 2o2o WL ll3o67o, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9844", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009845.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 47 of 49\nMar. 9, 2o2o); Strike 3 Holdings, LLC v.

(Def. Mem. at 53-56). The cases cited by the defendant\nin support of its motion to strike are inapposite,”? and in any event Juror 5o’s motion, whether or\nnot ultimately granted, is hardly “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” The\ndefendant further claims that the pleadings are not “judicial documents” at the current stage of the\nproceedings as they have not been ruled upon by the Court and, therefore, “are afforded no\npresumption of public access.” (/d. at 54, 56). She is wrong.

Metzger v. Hussman, 682 F. Supp. llo9, llo (D. Nev. l988),\nwhich the defendant cites (Def. Mem. at 54), is also inapposite. Metzger is a civil case in which\nthe court granted a motion to strike an opposition to a motion to dismiss that was filed in an\nuntimely manner because “[a]pplicable rules of procedure . . . must be enforced in this case, as in\nany case, so that the Court may maintain control over the progress of litigation before it.” Metzger,\n682 F.

The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “discovery\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether discovery materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for discovery can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. l9-49o (S.D.N.Y.). We are\nconcerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,\nsuch as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join\nthe Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrou\nindependent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding\npersonally identifiable information unrelated to victims.

THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST FOR INTERVENTION\nThe Government is not a party to this civil action against Maxwell, and therefore does not\nhave standing to move for a stay of this action. Thus, for the limited purpose of seeking a stay,\nthe Government has sought leave to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the action. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at l.) This\nCourt finds it unnecessary, houever, to deal with the Government’s leter in an “intervention”\nframework, which would require an inquiry as to whether the Government meets the standards\nset out in Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, given that a motion for a stay\nhas already been made by Maxwell, this Court finds it appropriate, in connection with that\nmotion and in the exercise of its discretion, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an\namicus curiae. See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 288 (2olo)\n(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative to\nintervention.”); Washington State Inv. Bd. v.

These suggestions are\ndisingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented.

That a Court can modify a protective order\nat any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(l) authorizes the Court to\nregulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline\nBeecham Corp. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that\nJuror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.\nThe Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire and a copy of\nthis Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the\nquestioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the\nGovernment. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance with\nthe Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom\n9o6 of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York,\nNew York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions.

Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that\nJuror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.\nThe Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire and a copy of\nthis Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will conduct the\nquestioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant and the\nGovernment. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance with\nthe Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom\n9o6 of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York,\nNew York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt.

The United States has no\nobjection to Epstein self-reporting to begin serving his sentence not\nlater than January 4, 2oo8.\n\nl2.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. Section 377l,\nDoe v. United States, Case No. 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2oo8).

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”'*? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. /*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised.\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!*? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'44 When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nl4o This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nlal OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\nIe Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\ntas As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nl For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut\ndoun an ongoing FBI probe... .” Julie K.

Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l292", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021361.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel89 of 258\nSA-l87\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\n\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021509.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page79 of 2l7\nSA-333\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 333 of 348\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law.!*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!*”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'*? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'“4 When asked about\nl39 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nl4o This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl4l OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struack—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.jpg": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n72l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023199.jpg": "proof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\n<span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l99", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023200.jpg": "promise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span>\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l/8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023216.jpg": "with one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to <span class=\"highlight\">intervene</span> and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023345.jpg": "sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.
