Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span> that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault.

Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span> that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it).

So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder.

And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span> that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma.

Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007531.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 38 of 375\n(Eds) The study of eyewitness testimony: Seeking for the bridge between law and psychology.

Asa\n2l forensic psychologist, I'm taking on more of an investigative\n22 role, and my work is to answer some particular psycho-legal\n23 question from an objective perspective, and it involves\n24 certainly never taking what someone has to say at face value\n25 but, rather, a fairly well-established process of multiple\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7884", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l7 of l59l6\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl techniques to arrive at the -- my professional opinion.\n\n2 Q.

Can you please explain.\n\n2 A. So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span> that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

Dworkin, Anna E.\nJaffe, Michele Bedard-Gilligan, and Skye Fitzpatrick, PTSD in the Year Follouing Sexual\nAssault: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2l)\nhtps://doi.org/lo.ll77/l524838o2llo322l3. A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma. Caron Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, et al., Chronicity in Postraumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) and Predictors of Course of Comorbid PTSD in Patients with Anxiety Disorders, l2 J.\nTraumatic Stress (l999), 89-loo.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged\npsychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic\nevent; marked physiological reactions to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the\ntraumatic event; avoidance or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about\nor closely associated with the traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external\nreminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing\nmemories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 27l-272. Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page l4 of 42\n-Neurology India\n-Oxford University Press (advisor on a book proposal)\n-Psychosomatics\n-Social Science & Medicine\n-The American Journal on Addictions\n-The Forensic Examiner\n-Violence and Victims\n-World Journal of Surgical Oncology\nBOOK REVIEWS:\nl.

Among the most recent research on the\nsubject was conducted in Australia, where Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels closely examined the\nperspectives of six adult female victims and fifteen justice professionals, supplemented by analysis of\none hundred sentencing statements.

So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have experienced a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4969", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015234.jpg": "(Eds) The study of eyewitness testimony: Seeking for the bridge between law and psychology.

Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication.

Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies —\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\n<span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep <span class=\"highlight\">depression</span>.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e., the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday.
