Sadly, the accurate count of victims\nwill never be knoun. My book \"Silenced No More\" chronicles it as a \"journey to hell and back\".\nAlthough I have escaped the hellish trap set by Epstein, Maxwell and others, I continue, nou l7\nyears later, to suffer from the horrific trauma it caused.\n\nI came to New York at age 22, wanting to start my life over after an incredibly abusive\nrelationship. I hoped to atend FIT and work in the fashion industry.\n\nSoon after arriving, I met an Epstein/Maxwell recruiter named Natalya Malyshev in a club.\nShe befriended me and, soon after that, arranged for me to meet Jeffery. She described him as a kind\nphilanthropist who could help me get into FIT and provide much-needed support, something which\nwas alien to me.\n\nOver the next seven to eight months, I became, against my will, nothing more than a human\nsex toy with a heartbeat and soul for the <span class=\"highlight\">entertainment</span> of Epstein, Maxwell and others. Sometimes I\nwas subjected to sexual predation multiple times per day, both in his New York mansion and on his\nprivate island St. Litle James in the US Virgin Islands. On one visit to the island, the sexual\ndemands, degradation and humiliation became so horrific that I tried to escape by atempting to\njump off a cliff into shark-infested waters, but was caught by Maxwell and company moments\nbefore jumping. At the time, the extremely risky escape seemed more appealing than being raped\none more time.\n\nAs the evidence at the trial of Ms. Maxwell proved, and my oun experience confirms,\nMaxwell was Epstein’s right-hand woman.
