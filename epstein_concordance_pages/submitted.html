Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nAO Foley Square\nNew York, New York looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page l of 4\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP l2l2 987 76oo phone\nwww.cohen gresser.com\n; USDCSDNY—t™\nMaks oe ” DOCUMENT\npape ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nmcohen@cohengresser.com aia pt, a\nceverdell@cohengresser.com DATE Ficep:_l2/7/2o___\nNovember 25, 2o2o\nTO BE FILED UNDER SEAL\nVIA EMAIL (<span class=\"highlight\">SUBMITTED</span> PURSUANT TO SECTION 2(B)\nOF JUDGE NATHAN’S INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES IN CRIMINAL CASES)\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Paul A. Engelmayer\nUnited States District Judge\nThurgood Marshall United States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-33o (S.D.N-Y.)\nDear Judge Engelmayer:\nWe represent\ncamer On the late afternoon of Friday, August l, through different counsel, were\normed by the U.S. Department of Justice (““DOJ” or “the government’) that they are\nreferenced in some capacity in the sealed grand jury materials that are the subject of DOJ’s\nrecent motion for unsealing. See U.S. Mot. to Unseal Grand Jury Trs., July l8, 2o25, Dkt. No.\n\n: 785. requested from the government information about the context in\nwhich are named in these materials in order to inform our arguments regarding the\ncontinued sealing of the grand jury materials. The government has declined to provide us with\nany information. Absent such information, we cannot respond with specificity to any reference\nin the record oven a Specificity in this context may not be required, houever, as\nSupreme Court precedent and caselaw in this Circuit make clear what this Court recognized in its\nJuly 22, 2o25 Order—i.e., that there is “long-established policy [of] maintain[ing] the secrecy of\nthe grand jury proceedings in the federal courts.” United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356\nU.S. 677, 68l (l958); see also In re Grand Jury Investigation of Cuisinarts, Inc., 665 F.2d 24, 28\n(2d Cir. l98l) (“This time-honored policy of secrecy has been the most essential, indeed\nindispensable, characteristic of grand jury proceedings.”). Indeed, this requirement of secrecy\nhas been codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). While the Second Circuit has\nrecognized that there are certain “special circumstances” outside of Rule 6(e)! that may justify\nthe unsealing of grand jury records, the burden of demonstrating those special circumstances is\neven greater than the already heavy burden of demonstrating the applicability of one of the\nexceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e). See In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6 n.lo (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\n! The government does not point to any of the statutory exceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e) to justify the need for\ndisclosure here, instead relying solely on “special circumstances” outside the bounds of those exceptions as\narticulated in Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99 (2d Cir. l997).
