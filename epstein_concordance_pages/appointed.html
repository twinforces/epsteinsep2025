After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding.

(See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts.

As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review discovery and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 34 of 45\nappeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in leading extradition cases; and\nhas acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on international cooperation.\n(/d.). In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. (/d. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n4 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. JJ] 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition\nof a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (/d. at l).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page l9 of 29\nAnnex B — CV of David Perry OC\n\nl.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 348\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 32 of 349\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll4 of 349\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

STERNHEIAA\n\nStates District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered a semi-anonymous jury (jurors\nwere publicly referred to by number only) and released the names of all potential jurors to\ncounsel, plus all pro se defendants (including Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell), who\nare allegedly prominent white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the leaders of hate groups that\nplanned, promoted, and executed the violent acts in Charlotesville. (See Exhibit A, annexed.)\nThe defendants in Sines included factions of the Ku Klux Klan. The concerns for juror privacy in\nSines dwarf any conceivable concerns in this case and Sines is also the subject of extensive\nongoing publicity. We submit that withholding the names of 6oo jurors until the day of jury\nselection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury and is a\nprocedure that would violate due process in this particular case.!\n\n“An impartial jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of\ninterest and bias.” United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, ll (2d Cir. 2ol5). In Parse, a case\nbefore Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and\nthree of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86.\nAfter trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground\nthat one of the jurors, Juror No. l (Catherine M. Conrad), “had lied and withheld material\ninformation during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Bobbi\nC. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror\nwas examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867\nF.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2ol2) found it “undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire\nand concealed important information about her background” (id. at 45l), her level of education,\nplace of residence, criminal history, and other maters.

Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding.

Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> by courts to oversee financial maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9.

And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court).

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8. On December 8, 2oo8, after the presidential election and while Epstein was serving his state\nprison sentence, Acosta was formally recused from all maters involving the law firm of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021205.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page33 of 258\nSA-3l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 348\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021287.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3536o38, Pagell5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “TI enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021407.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 333 3536o38, Page235 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 233 of 348\nA, September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.”””’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”?”> Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy.

The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier island off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county.

Alexander Acosta was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater.

As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ .. . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023125.tif": "this mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, ““Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023245.tif": "A.

James C. Wills,\nformer Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span> a team to conduct a\npsychological reconstruction._The team consisted National Suicide Prevention\nCoordinator, Central Office: Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator,\nCentral Office Pee ental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and\nCorrectional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030276.tif": "Case 9:o8-cv-8oll9-KAM Document3o5 Entered on FLSD Docket o9/l7/2oo9 Page 4 of 8\nl4, Any suggestion that the chance “visual” between Mr. Epstein and Jane Doe No. 4\nwas “pre-planned” would be absurd, disingenuous and false. The undersigned counsel went out\nof his way to make certain Mr. Epstein would not be in the building after the time the deposition\nwas sef to begin. Had the Plaintiff and her counsel been in the deposition room at the <span class=\"highlight\">appointed</span>\ntime, no visual contact would have occurred. )\nl5. It is possible that Plaintiff’s counsel, by filing their motion for protective order on\nSeptember 9, 2oo9 and then advising the undersigned on September l4, 2oo9 that the deposition\n- would not go forward unless the undersigned agreed to exclude Mr. Epstein from the deposition, |\nwere not prepared and/or did not want to proceed with the deposition. |\nl6.
