The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000987.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt DibeutreOtl 22o 2Ft il e@ OFAL8) 26a geadgec’ 2Ho9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding. These are glaring red flags, even before the Court considers the\ngravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if convicted at trial.\n\nInstead of atempting to address the risks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to\nextraordinary financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in\nFrance, and who has already demonstrated a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendant\ninstead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than an unsecured bond. Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, an unknoun number of whom\neven reside in the United States, and none of whose assets are identified. The Court and the\nGovernment have no information whatsoever regarding whether these co-signers would be able to\nable to pay the proposed $5 million bond should the defendant flee — or if, of equal concern, the\nco-signers are themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so.\nThe defendant does not identify what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern District of\nNew York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the area. And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001129.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQo3GouAUNt Dibeutre/tl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a dedgs BE 2HA5\nof release); United States v.

Both have concluded that it is highly unlikely that she would be able to resist\nextradition successfully.\n\nUnited Kingdom.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>.

The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l.

Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by\nan extradition treaty signed on 3l March 2oo3°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom‘ by the 2oo3 Act”.\n\nOverview of the extradition process\n\n4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom.

That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283.

It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis.

Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information. Villafafia told OPR that she agreed with Lourie that a criminal\ncomplaint charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what the\ncase was about” would be a good way to “get things moving” touard a pre-indictment plea.\n\nAlthough Lourie and Villafafia believed a pre-indictment plea agreement was a desired\nresolution, there was no guarantee that Epstein would agree to plead guilty, and they continued to\nwork together to shape an indictment.

The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo323l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. **\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 55 of 349\n\nthe FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment.

Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page l8 of 93\n\\Count Two: Enticement to Engage in an Illegal Sexual Activity — The Statute __| Commented [CEl7]: The defense objects to beginning out\nof order with the substantive counts and grouping the\nThe relevant statute for Count Two is Title l8, United States Code, Section 2422. which Seri eee oe arian jeriggs they\nare charged in the Indictment, and each count should be\n| provides that “[w]hoever knouingly persuades, induces, or | enticed-srecerces any individual to separately addressed\nCommented [RA(l8Rl7]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any <span class=\"highlight\">Territory</span> or Possession of the United States, to \\ The Govemment submits that it will be clearer for the jury\n: . cg ‘ . -: \\_| then incorporate that explanation for the conspiracy offenses\nengage in . . . in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal \\\nme F A Commented [CEl9]: The defense objects to the inclusion\noffense,” is guilty of a federal crime. of the term “coerces” if the proof at trial does not include\nevidence of the use of force of other coercion —\nCommented [RA(2oRl9]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:\nThe term “coerce” carries its ordinary meaning. see United\nStates v.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>.

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4.

Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22.

In this case, the District Court did not just purport to\nfollou Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable\n<span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId.

Lourie told OPR that to the best of his\nrecollection, he thought a plea agreement would be a good result, and although the government\nmight have to “give up some jail time,” there were other benefits to a plea, such as the ability to\nrequire Epstein to register as a sex offender and the availability of monetary damages for the\nvictims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should setle and we should set it up so we can\nsetle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by complaint and then negotiating a plea to limited\ncharges in a criminal information.

Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021239.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when... more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and .. . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023066.tif": "the FBI squad supervisor on May 9, 2oo7, to explain that charges against Epstein would not be\nquickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “not happy” about the delay, adding,\n“T did not even tell them I think we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and\noffer a pre-indictment deal, figuring a judge might never agree to such a deal post indictment.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\nom Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023185.tif": "d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.”*!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span> to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023186.tif": "The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\nresponsibility for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted <span class=\"highlight\">territory</span>,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031634.jpg": "Telephone: l-8oo-435-7352\nNotice of Preferred Carrier Freeze Option\nIn compliance with the Rules of the Florida Public Service Commission dealing with\nthe unauthorized switching of local, local toll and long distance services, this is\nto notify you that a preferred carrier (PC) freeze option is available to you at no\ncharge.
