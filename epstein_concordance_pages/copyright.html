These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Research has found that delays in disclosure are\nlonger for those abused within the family (Sjoberg and Lindblad, 2oo2;\nGoodman-Broun ef al., 2oo3; Kogan, 2oo4; Hershkouitz et al., 2oo5).\nTherefore, children who disclose more promptly may be overrepresented in\nlegal samples. ‘Children who disclose\nIn Sweden, Priebe and Svedin (2oo8) conducted a national survey of 4339 | more promptly may be\nadolescents, of whom l962 reported some form of sexual abuse (65% of girls .\nand 23% of boys).

Of those who did disclose, 8o.5 per cent\nmentioned a ‘friend of my oun age’ as the only person who they had told. In\nthis study, 6.8 per cent had reported their experiences to the social authorities\nor police. A further Swedish study of l22 women who had experienced\nchildhood sexual abuse (Jonson and Lindblad, 2oo4) found that 32 per cent\ndisclosed during childhood (before the age of l8) while the majority told in\nadulthood (68%). The delay was up to 49 years, with an average of 2l years\n(SD = l2.9). Of those who told in childhood, 59 per cent told only one person.\nIn Ireland, the SAVI study (n = 3ll8, McGee e¢ al., 2oo2) found that 47 per\ncent of those respondents who had experienced some form of sexual assault\nprior to age l7 had told no-one of this experience until the survey.

The issue of partial disclosures was highlighted by\nearlier studies such as those by DeVoe and Faller (l999) of five- to ten-year\nolds (i.e. making detailed informal disclosures that were not replicated in\nformal interviews) and Elliot and Briere (l994) of children aged eight to\nl5 years (i.e. disclosing only partial information until confronted with external\nevidence that led to more complete disclosures).\n\nMore recently, investigators have examined the role of the interviewer and\nquestioning styles in the forensic interview and hou this impacts on children’s\ndisclosures and the level of detail provided in interview. Hershkouitz ef al.\n(2oo6) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed sexual abuse\nand those who did not (but about whom there was ‘substantial’ reason to\nbelieve that they had been abused). They found that interviewers behaved\n\n‘They found that differently with the two groups, using different types of prompts with children\ninterviewers behaved who presented as somewhat uncooperative, offered fewer details and gave\ndiff tl ith th more uninformative responses at the beginning of the interview. It would\nPerea wl e appear that interviewers responded to less communicative children by\ntwo groups’ increasing the proportion of closed questions which in turn led to children\nbeing less forthcoming. Lamb ef al, (2oo2) have found that the use of a\nprotocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. ‘tell\nme about that’) as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no\nresponse) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children’s\n\naccounts.\n\nAlthough few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of disclosure in\ninformal setings (when disclosure is made to a friend or family member),\nsome qualitative studies have described this process. McElvaney (2oo8) quoted\none teenage girl who described hinting to her mother prior to disclosing the\nexperience: ‘I didn’t tell her what happened but I was saying things that made\n\n‘A parent described her think it made her think that it happened but I didn’t tell her’ (p. l27).

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al.

The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure.

Many of these cases | with the legal system?’\nwere referred to the higher courts for judicial review proceedings to establish\nwhether the cases could proceed without prejudicing the accused given the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Copyright</span> © 2ol3 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al. (2ol2) describe the importance for young people of\n. containing the secret of abuse and their need for confidentiality follouing\n‘An adaptive strategy disclosure as representing an adaptive strategy on the part of the young person\non the part of the to contain the experience and his/her emotional reaction to it.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

A pilot study has making disclosures’\nsuggested that this is an appropriate methodology for gathering data on\nchildren’s experiences of informal disclosure, acknouledging the limitations\nof such an approach. Ungar et al.

Their findings in confidentiality\nrelation to the importance of bridge building for young people to access formal\nsupports are supported by Jensen ef al.’s (2oo5) emphasis on the dialogical\nnature of disclosure, and the important role that trusted adults and peers play\nin the disclosure process through noticing signs of psychological distress and\nasking young people about their psychological wellbeing (Collings ef al.,\n\n2oo5; Jensen ef al., 2oo5; McElvaney et al., 2ol2). More emphasis is therefore\nneeded on providing opportunities for children and young people to disclose.\nThe challenge for professionals and those who care for children is hou to do\nthis in a way that protects children and promotes their wellbeing.\n\nReferences\n\nCollings SJ, Griffiths S$, Kumalo M. 2oo5.

A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid\n\"Bright Young Things,\" writen by one of their oun, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this croud as a bunch of\ntwits living off their trust funds.\nGhislaine's oun funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the\ncrash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to oun an apartment on the\nUpper East Side and a mews house in London.\nShe is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly\nhas holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of atractive young women, and it's\nsaid that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.\nGhislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be\nheavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing\nwere diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going doun the toilet.\n\nReproduced with permission of the <span class=\"highlight\">copyright</span> ouner.
