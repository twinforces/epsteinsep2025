If any develop or change in <span class=\"highlight\">intensity</span>, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication. Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax.

Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233"};
