Jeffrey Epstein\nCase No.: l9 CR 49o (RMB)\nDear Judge Berman:\nWe represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, including several individuals whose names and\nidentifying information appear in the subject materials. In that vein, we write to address the\nDepartment of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to\nadminister any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (““CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nI.

Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany <span class=\"highlight\">Henderson</span>\nEDWARDS <span class=\"highlight\">HENDERSON</span>\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

Extradition requests are rarely discharged on the basis that the case in the requesting state is politically\nmotivated or abusive. It is well established that there is a presumption of good faith in relation to a\nrequesting state, such as the US, which has a long history of respect for democracy, human rights and\nthe rule of law, and which has longstanding extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom”.\n\n28. It is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to establish that the US prosecutor had acted in\nbad faith, for example by seeking her extradition for a collateral motive in circumstances where they\nknew there was no real case against her®’.\n\n29. It is also highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to establish that her extradition was sought\nfor the purpose of prosecuting or punishing her on account of her political opinions, or that she might\nbe prejudiced at her trial or punished, detained or restricted in her personal liberty by reason of those\nopinions”.\n\nPassage of time\n\n3o. Notwithstanding the date of the allegations in the superseding indictment, a judge is unlikely to\nconclude that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite Ms Maxwell by reason of the passage of\ntime since the alleged commission of the offences®. The courts have upheld orders for extradition in\ncases with similar timescales to those in Ms Maxwell’s case, including two cases involving historic\nallegations of sexual offending where the relevant time period was 2o and 33 years. In both cases, the\ncourts placed emphasis on the public interest in ensuring that extradition arrangements were honoured\nand in ensuring that serious allegations were tried”.\n\n3l. As to oppression, the graver the offence the higher the threshold for oppression™. Given the\nseriousness of the offences in Ms Maxwell’s case, it is unlikely that she would be able to establish that\nany personal or family hardship that might be caused by the extradition” should outweigh the public\n\n»° Ahmad v United Kingdom (2olo) 5l EHRR SE6, para. lo5.\n°° R (Bermingham) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2oo7| QB 727, para. loo.\n*' Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 8l.\n© Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 82.

Similarly, there is a high threshold in relation to injustice’,\nand it is very unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to meet it. There is a general presumption that\nJustice will be done despite the passage of time and the burden is on the requested person to establish\nthe contrary’. In assessing injustice, the appropriate judge would have regard to the procedural\nsafeguards that exist under US domestic law”. Further, the judge is very likely to place weight on the\nfact that Ms Maxwell had, in the hypothetical scenario under consideration, absconded from ongoing\nproceedings that would otherwise have resulted in her trial in the US. As the English High Court\nexpressed it in Zollman “the very fact that the accused invokes justice to prevent [their] extradition\nrequires consideration of the circumstances which have led to the fact that [they are] not facing\njustice in the country from which [they have] fled””°. In those circumstances it is very unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of passage of time to defeat extradition.\n\nForum\n\n32. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of forum, which applies where\nextradition would not be in the interests of justice because: (a) a substantial measure of the requested\nperson’s ‘relevant activity’ ”’ occurred in the UK; and (b) having regard to ‘the specified maters’””\nrelating to the interests of justice (and only those maters), the extradition should not take place”.\n\n33. Although some of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment is said to have occurred in\nLondon”, three of the ‘specified maters’ are likely to weigh heavily against a finding that extradition\nwould be barred by forum. First, it appears that the majority of the harm caused by the offending”\nalleged in the superseding indictment occurred in the United States. An extradition judge would treat\n\n°° Kakis at 784.

See\nUnited States v.

Prejudice in this context\nrefers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 6o2\nF.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979). The mere loss of witnesses or evidence, without more, is\ninsufficient.

No. 2o7 at l7 (citing Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752)). The burden for proving both\nprongs of the standard rests squarely on the defendant. United States v. Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993,\nlol4 (2d Cir. l99o); United States v. Rubin, 6o9 F.2d 5l, 66 (2d Cir. l979); United States v. Ricco,\n549 F.2d 264, 272 (2d Cir. l977). The burden is so heavy that it is rarely met by a defendant. See\nDeMichele v. Greenburgh Centr. Sch. Dist. No. 7, l67 F.3d 784, 79o-9l (2d Cir. l999) (“[W]hile\nthe [Supreme] Court may not have shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due\nProcess Clause forecloses prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely\najar.”).\n\nSubstantial prejudice is just that—substantial, actual, non-speculative prejudice. See\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5-o6 (2d Cir. l982) (a defendant’s “proof of prejudice\nmust be definite and not speculative”); see also United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Henderson</span>, 337 F.3d 9l4, 92o\n(7th Cir. 2oo3) (prejudice sufficient to warrant dismissal for pre-indictment delay must be “actual\nand substantial” and “specific, concrete, and supported by evidence”). Prejudice in this context\nrefers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 6o2\nF.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979). It is well-established that the mere loss of evidence or of\nwitnesses, by death or otherwise, without more, is insufficient. See, e.g., United States v. Snyder,\n668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. l982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v.

Villafafia told\nOPR that her expectation was that the state plea proceeding would allou Edwards and his clients\nthe ability to comment on the resolution:\n\n433 Reiter shoued the leter to the lead Detective so he could “confirm that all of the victims that we had for the\nstate case were included on that.” The Detective “looked at it and he said they’re all there and then [Reiter] destroyed\nit.” The Detective recalled viewing the list in Reiter’s office, but he could not recall when Reiter shoued it to him.\n354 The FBI co-case agent told OPR that “I don’t think the [FBI] reached out to anyone.”\n389 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that it was Sloman who gave her the instructions, but she could not\n“remember the specifics of the conversation.”\n356 Villafafia stated that she “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and\nneither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution charge to a\nspecific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct in his CVRA filings, in his recently published\nbook, Edwards described Villafafia as a “kindhearted prosecutor who tried to do right,” noting that she “believ[ed] in\nthe victims and tr[ied] ... to bring doun Jeffrey Epstein.” Bradley J.
