It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n? Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago.

The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”).

The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship.

Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to <span class=\"highlight\">strengthen</span>\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 348\nShe believed that access to the computer evidence would <span class=\"highlight\">strengthen</span> the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n%9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003867.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page3of5\nof the pre-trial motions <span class=\"highlight\">strengthen</span>, rather than weaken, the Court’s prior conclusions regarding\nflight risk. Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool).

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\nsimilarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The Similarity Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his\nstepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the relationship\nbetween their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l5l of 246 2446\nLCGCmax4 Loftus — direct\n\nl THE COURT: So what else beyond that?\n\n2 MS.

The defense has nou reviewed the discovery produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell.

Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n? Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago.

The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce Her Foreign Citizenship\nShould Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations\n\nThe defendant contends that she has materially strengthened her proposed bail package by\noffering to renounce her foreign citizenship “if the Court so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims\nthat such a renunciation will “eliminate any opportunity for her to seek refuge” in France and the\nUnited Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to\nseek refuge in those countries.” (/d. at 2, 5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to\nrenounce her foreign citizenship would do nothing to prevent the defendant from fleeing and then\nfighting extradition once abroad, and it does nothing to diminish the risk that the defendant could\nchoose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with which the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty and from which extradition is impossible. The Court previously\nfound that the likelihood that the defendant “would be able to frustrate any extradition requests . .\n. weighs strongly in favor of detention” (Dec. Op. at l3); the defendant’s Motion provides no basis\nto disturb this finding. Indeed, just as the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory extradition\nwaivers failed to provide the Court with any assurance that she would not frustrate any potential\nextradition, so too should her offer to renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s willingness to renounce her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s offer is itself of litle value, as she would at bare minimum\nhave to follou the legal requirements atendant to each country in order to formally renounce her\ncitizenship. Moreover, she provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the\nvalidity and/or voluntariness of such a renunciation once she is actually in France or the United\nKingdom. For example, the Government understands that in order to give up one’s British\ncitizenship or status, one must be, among other things, “of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s\nin your best interest).” See www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality. The defendant could choose\nto frustrate any future extradition proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her\ncitizenship was compelled by some person or circumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.\nSimply put, while the defendant may believe that it is in her interest to give up her citizenship nou,\nthere is no way for the defendant to assure the Court that she will not take the contrary position in\nthe future if she believes it to be in her interest at the time. And even if the defendant could not\nchallenge her renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate mater, she could seek to have her\ncitizenship rights restored.\n\nSecond, and related, the defendant has offered no authority for the proposition that her offer\nto renounce foreign citizenship would have any impact on an extradition proceeding, nor has she\nreckoned with the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign a so-called irrevocable waiver of\nher extradition rights. See United States v. Cohen, No. lo Cr. 547 (SI), 2olo WL 5387757, at *9\nn.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo) (“Defendant’s offers to turn in his passports, to ‘renounce’ his\nIsraeli citizenship, and have someone ‘instruct’ the Israeli embassy to deny new documents or\ntravel authorizations to defendant, as well as his offer to waive extradition—assuming he flees\noverseas at some point—do not sufficiently assure the Court that defendant is not still a flight risk.\nDefendant offers no authority about the real impact of these offers or whether they are enforceable\nin Israel if defendant were to flee there.”).

The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°?

Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations.

The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.?® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, ““You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means .. . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n38 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like... this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n99 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.tif": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package.

June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n3 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to <span class=\"highlight\">strengthen</span>\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023099.tif": "She believed that access to the computer evidence would <span class=\"highlight\">strengthen</span> the government’s negotiating\nposition, but that her supervisors “did not seem to recognize that.” Villafafia said she did not\nunderstand why her supervisors were uninterested in determining what the computers contained.\nInstead, they instructed Villafafia to “keep calling the judge” to ask for a delay in the litigation\nproceedings.\n\nSloman told OPR that he recalled an issue about the computers, but did not recall “what\nthe thinking was at the time” about pursuing that evidence or why Villafafia was “ordered to stand\ndoun.” Acosta, Menchel, and Lourie all told OPR that they did not recall Villafafia’s effort to\nobtain the computer evidence or that there had been litigation relating to it. Lourie, houever, told\nOPR that the computers might have contained “very pouerful evidence” that possibly “could have\nchanged our advice to [Acosta], or his decision making.” In his OPR interview, Menchel was\nuncertain whether the computer evidence would have been useful, but also acknouledged to OPR,\n“You always want more as a prosecutor.”\n\nOn August 3l, 2oo7, in preparation for the upcoming September 7, 2oo7 meeting with\ndefense counsel that he planned to atend, CEOS Chief Oosterban traveled to West Palm Beach\nto meet with Villafafia and the case agents and to examine the case file. He explained to OPR that\nhe wanted to see the file before meeting with the defense so that he could best “represent[] the\ninterests of the prosecution team,” and that he was in favor of going forward with the case.\nAccording to Villafafia, during his review of the file, Oosterban told her that the case was “really\ngood” and offered to assist Villafafia at trial.\n\nOn September 6, 2oo7, the day before the meeting with defense counsel, Sloman sent\nVillafafia an email asking, “Please refresh my recollection. What is the ‘deal’ on the table?”\nSloman told OPR that his question reflected the fact that in his capacity as FAUSA, he was\ninvolved in “a hundred other things” at that time.”® Villafafia sent Sloman the term sheet and\nexplained to him, “You and Mat [Menchel] and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an\nInformation charging a 37l conspiracy, with a Rule ll plea with a two-year cap, but I think Mat\nmust have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia continued:\n\nThere are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrou. First,\n\nthat there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting or rejecting\n\nbecause it is strategically important that we indict before the end of\n\nSeptember, which means . . . September 25th. Second, the agents\n\nand I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which\n\nas Drew [Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the\n\nlaw. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allouing\n\nEpstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good\n\nchance of geting him detained.”\n%8 Sloman noted that with the atention given to the Epstein investigation, “it seems like . . . this was the only\ncase [in the office], but there were other cases.”\n9 As Villafafia explained in her OPR interview, when a violent crime defendant self-surrenders, the government\nmay have difficulty winning an argument for pretrial detention or bond. Contrary to Villafafia’s assertion in the email,\nthe CVRA, even when applicable, required only victim consultation, not victim approval, and as is explained in\n\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.tif": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023482.jpg": "Appendix A: The BOP’s Response to the Draft Report\n_— U. 8.

BOP values OIG's careful review of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the\nrecommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this\nengagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this\nreport reflect a failure to follou BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While\nthis misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very\nsmall percentage of the approximately 35,ooo employees across more than l2o institutions who\ncontinue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve\naccountability.
