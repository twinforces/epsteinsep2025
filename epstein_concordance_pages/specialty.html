In all extradition cases, a requested person who consents to extradition loses the right to appeal against\neither the decision to send the case to the Secretary of State or the order for extradition®®.,\n\nl9. The main effect of a decision by a requested person to consent to extradition is that the overall extradition\nprocedure is substantially shortened. In the context of US extradition cases, this means that removal can\ntake place within months, sometimes weeks, as compared to the longer timescales considered above.\n\nC. Bail in extradition cases\n\n2o. Where extradition is sought for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person for an offence, the person\nhas the same right to bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proceedings, namely there is a presumption\nthat bail will be granted unless one of the exceptions in Schedule | to the Bail Act l976 applies”’. The\nthree exceptions in Schedule l that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are\nsubstantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to\ncustody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the\ncourse of justice®®.\n\n2l. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as\nmany of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature\nand seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and\ncommunity ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of\ntheir obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence\nagainst the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental\ninjury to another person.\n\n22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an indication as to the\nway in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice. In all five cases bail was refused”.\n\n“ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. l28(4).\n\n*’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s.95(2). The principle of <span class=\"highlight\">specialty</span> is a rule of extradition law that is intended to ensure that an\n\nextradited person is not dealt with in the requesting state for any offence other than that for which they have been\n\nextradited.\n\n“© Extradition Act 2oo3, ss. loo(2), lo3(2) and lo8(2).\n\n“’ Bail Act l976, s. 4(2A).

As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD.

Giuffre, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir. Dec. 27, |\n2ol8), ECF No. 83 at l (“Ms. Giuffre . . . is nou prepared to have the world see what the record\ncontains.”).

(l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n967 at 6.)\na This ruling came in response to a motion by Maxwell to compel Giuffre’s compliance with the document\ndestruction provision. It argued that Giuffre’s obligations thereunder were triggered at the time of setlement. (l5- :\nmm Dkt. Nos. 957.) Judge Sweet denied that motion in light of the pending appeals. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The Government filed\na first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which contained only small,\nministerial corrections.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced fo collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions fo the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local atorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $loo,ooo to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlosida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency.
