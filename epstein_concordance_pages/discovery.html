Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a\ncombination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the\nsafety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed\nsupra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nYours truly,\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)-5o6-39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6-395o\nrweingarten@steptoe.com\nMartin G.

United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nGovernment retains the “ultimate burden of persuasion” that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo792 /\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000845.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Page6 of 24\n\ncapacity of the internet platform system, only one atorney per party may participate\nby video.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n?

Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District.

V/d.). When the guard saw the FBI\nagents walking up the driveway to the house, he again assumed that they were members of\nthe press. U/d.). Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that the press was on the\ngrounds and approaching the house. (/d.). In accordance with the procedure that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. (/d.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest: she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered. It would make\nno sense for her to try to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001127.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt DibeuMe/ntl £7o 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a cedgs Sf 2o45\nIndeed, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail.

Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001132.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FOd3GouAuNt Dibeute/ntl $7o 2Ail ed 42SBM 26acedGs 36 2o45\n\nE. The <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including the entire initial tranche of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

The facts\nstrongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms. Maxwell—who was\nnot named in the Epstein indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in\ntheir custody. The lack of corroboration in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> confirms that the case against Ms.\nMaxwell was an afterthought and was reverse engineered based on allegations of 25-year-\nold conduct from a small number of alleged victims.\n\nThus, notwithstanding the statement in the government's bail submission, we have\nbeen provided with no meaningful documentary corroboration in this case. It appears that\nthe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that allegedly took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration only\nreinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and strengthens her\nlong-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear her name in court. This\nfactor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms. Maxwell bail.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001137.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedg@s 4l 2o45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001138.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeutre/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge 42 2o45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.\"\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus. As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n'3 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001140.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FOd3GouAUNt Dibeutre/tl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cede 44 2o45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits. This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the\nMDC. Within a two-day period from December l to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive,\ncompared with 25 from March to December l. As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\nM4 See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001155.jpg": "CaSede2ot er OD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a ded deci 3 Ob 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001156.jpg": "CaSede2oter-CoS32ocAINt nN DGcGMenoloo) 7Filed G2hL8) 26 acedgect 4 G6 36\n\nIn addition to corroborating each other, these victims’ accounts are further corroborated by\nother witnesses and by documentary evidence, which has been produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. That\nevidence will make it virtually indisputable that these victims in fact met and interacted with both\nthe defendant and Jeffrey Epstein at the times and locations they describe. Po\nevidence, additional witnesses will confirm that both the defendant and Epstein knew and\ninteracted with certain minor victims when those victims were minors. In other words, the\nGovernment’s evidence strongly corroborates the victims’ testimony that they met and interacted\nwith the defendant and Epstein at particular times and in particular places.\n\nIn the instant motion, the defendant complains that the documentary evidence relevant to\nthe three victims identified in the Indictment and produced to date is not sufficiently voluminous\n? In its Renewed Bail Motion, the defense a\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001174.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagecs A Ob 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001175.jpg": "CaSedeZot er-OoF3ocAdNt n DEGmeholooo 2File@ 4258/26 a Ragec8 3 Ob 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001176.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagpecd 4 Ob 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at the MDC.'!

Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision.

On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001193.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/ooBBGHAUNt DOcuNei LA8 2 Filed6R223/2thgPageBlGdl5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl.

(Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\n|| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001229.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeh'olo4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a deageo? d G6 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001263.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiRGSSe/Raghiages o6l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment.

The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001289.jpg": "Caseel22 o/o o8BOHAEN ADE uUMAEht /L52 l Filecsad 6729 ePageBlGks\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the deleterious effect of the conditions under which Ms.\nMaxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

HI6\nComplicating maters further is the fact that both of Mr. Robertson’s initial defense atorneys have\nrecently withdrawn from the case, and both of his current atorneys have been appointed within\nthe past six months (one in the last three weeks). The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- ooool3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001303.jpg": "Cass4 :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDichmehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/Alagedge HB l4l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\nnecessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001316.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 38, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o7529l, Page2 of 3\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nwee ee ew ew ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee eee ee x\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : AFFIRMATION\nAppellee, :\n-V.- : Docket Nos. 2l-58, 2l-\n: 77o\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant-Appellant, :\nee. }\nSTATE OF NEW YORK )\nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK : SS.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK_)\n\nLARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l746, hereby affirms under penalty of\nperjury:\n\nl.

The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

D at 79-\n9l; Ex. H at 7-2o; Ex. L at 6-ll). Maxwell does not come close to identifying clear\nerror.\n\n34. Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, l49 F.\nApp’x 4o, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2oo5); United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9, 32l n.7\n(2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Vondete, 5 F.

At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications. V/d. at 2o n.3).

Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant. Maxwell has access to a desktop computer provided by the MDC\nand a laptop provided by the Government for Maxwell’s exclusive use to review\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. (Ex. F at 29-3o; Gov’t Ex. A\nat l7-l8).

Cf. United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344 (2d\nCir. 2ooo).\n\n8 In-person visitation at the MDC resumed on or about February l6, 2o2l. Atorney\nvisits are permited seven days per week. (Ex.

Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated August 25, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001344.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo8aGAU Ant Boeument 72o FileaOVH26R o aPage ka 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001347.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo88GAUNnt BOcument B2o Filedl2/o7 Re aBage tla 2\ng Wig SOO\nfy s) ENE \\\n(een U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\\3 es> |.)

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterial. A <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID.

Given the millions of documents that\nMs. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be\ngiven as much time as possible with the laptop to review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week.

Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001355.jpg": "_ Caesesb:2o-cl/ oo88o4o st BOcument 4/29 2 Filed/o27/o4/PagPage fat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. Since the Government made its first <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material.

In this respect, the Government\nnotes that the trial date remains approximately six months away, the BOP was already affording\nthe defendant access to the laptop for some 65 hours a week, and the BOP was further providing\nweekend access to a desktop computer should the defendant wish to spend more than 65 hours\neach week reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nUnited States Atorney\n\nBy: __s/\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001357.jpg": "_ _Casesb:2o-cr/ oo 88olANNnt BOctIMent 28.2 Filed/G2/o5/PagPage tlt 2\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate.

When the parties were originally negotiating a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million.

But given the nature of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month.

The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video.

The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her.

It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties.

Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a\nprotective order in the form atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nThe government has indicated that it requires the entry of a protective order before\nproducing any <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool643\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” Jd. § 6. This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001648.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29-l Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~e ee ee eee LLL LL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° PROVE CPT vn ONDER\n- 7, = :\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n~e ee ee eee LLL LL\nALISON J.

Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false. The protective order in the Epstein case included\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33-l Filed o7/28/2o Page l of l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v. Corley, No. l3-CR-48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (this\nCourt denied the defendant’s request for the disclosure of the full names of victims whose surnames had previously\nbeen concealed from the public record); United States v. Paris, No. CR. 3:o6-CR-64 (CFD), 2oo7 WL l484974, at\n*2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7) (permiting several victim witnesses to testify at trial without disclosing their full\nnames where they had not previously been publicly identified as sex workers); United States v. Kelly, No. o7-CR-\n374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL 5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (prohibiting public disclosure of identities of\ngovernment witnesses where there was no indication that the names previously appeared in the public record).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 29, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nreference the identities of the alleged victims in conversations with prospective witnesses (Gov’t\nResp. at 2), the defense will be limited in our ability to /ocate these witnesses without the\nbroader language proposed in our protective order. It is therefore important to the defense\ninvestigation and Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial that the protective order not restrict the\ndefense’s ability to publicly reference the names of Ms. Maxwell’s accusers who have already\nchosen to publicly identify themselves. °\n\nFinally, the government’s claim that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> will include the identities of\nindividuals “whom the Government does not expect to call as witnesses, and whose accounts—\nmuch less identities—will have no bearing on this case” is beside the point. (Gov’t Resp. at\n4). If the government were prepared to represent that it will base its case solely on the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment, the analysis might be different. But that is\nunlikely. And it goes without saying that since the defense does not have a single page of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> yet, much less the government’s witness list, we cannot knou which of the individuals\nreferenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> the government plans to use as a witness at trial, or whether such\nwitnesses may be relevant to a potential defense presentation. Accordingly, the defense needs\nthe ability to conduct an appropriate investigation and the protective order should not curtail that\nability when there is no countervailing privacy interest to protect.\n\n2. Preventing the Improper Use of <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Materials by Potential Government\n\nWitnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant’s proposed protective order subjects potential government witnesses and\ntheir counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials—namely, if these individuals are given access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials during trial\npreparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing\nfor trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2;\nEx. A 493, 5).\n\nThe government construes the defense’s proposal as one that “impose[s] restrictions upon\nthe Government” itself. (Gov. Resp. at 5 (emphasis added)). It then provides a list of other\nstatutes and regulations that might impose restrictions on the government that may be in conflict\nwith the protective order, arguing that this possibility for conflict warrants rejection of the\ndefense’s proposed language.”\n\n* Tt is not, as the government gratuitously asserts, so that the defense can engage in witness intimidation. (Gov’t\nResp. at 3 n.2).\n“The government does not explain why, in the event of such conflict, it could not apply to the Court for resolution\nof potentially competing obligations.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 2 of 3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt. No. 33-l, 95. This proposal adequately balances the interests at\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 3 of 3\nstake. And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense’s\npapers explains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order,\nwhich will be entered on the docket.\n\nThis resolves Dkt.

First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, despite confirming to the Court that <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial production” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its production of Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Houever, the government did not make its first production until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial production was a subset of non-electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on a rolling basis, if the initial production is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] protective order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust lo, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nDistrict courts have the inherent authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses. See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 4 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nSee Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2 (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the identity to the defendant\nwould subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the likelihood that victim will refuse\nto appear or testify’).\n\nWith each day that passes without knouing the identities of Victims l-3, the defense is\nlosing crucial time to conduct a meaningful investigation and prepare its defense so that Ms.\nMaxwell can receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being\nwoken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\nfact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting\nrisk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to\nundergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison\nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively\ncurtailed or eliminated altogether.\n\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her\ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. Ms.\nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes\non them, and to discuss them with her atorneys. But there currently is no such structure in\nplace. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard\ndrive containing the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing\nthe first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a\nprocedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are\ntwo significant flaws in this proposal:\n\ne The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms.\nMaxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including\nshouers. The BOP should not be permited to force Ms. Maxwell to\nchoose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and\nparticipating in her oun defense.\n\ne Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three\nhours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing\ndocuments in a complex case with voluminous document <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, such\nas this one. As an illustration, the government’s first set of production\nmaterials consists of nearly l3,ooo pages of documents. Assuming it\ntakes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those\nmaterials, based on the BOP’s proposed cap of three hours per day of\nreview, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of\ndocuments at the earliest by mid-November 2o2o. This is entirely\nunworkable under the schedule set by the Court.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not\nbe specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her\ndefense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 4o hours a week\nor more reviewing the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 6 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

For these reasons, we\nrespectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being\nwoken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\nfact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting\nrisk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to\nundergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison\nresources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively\ncurtailed or eliminated altogether.\n\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her\ndefense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. Ms.\nMaxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes\non them, and to discuss them with her atorneys. But there currently is no such structure in\nplace. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard\ndrive containing the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing\nthe first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a\nprocedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are\ntwo significant flaws in this proposal:\n\ne The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms.\nMaxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including\nshouers. The BOP should not be permited to force Ms. Maxwell to\nchoose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and\nparticipating in her oun defense.\n\ne Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three\nhours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing\ndocuments in a complex case with voluminous document <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, such\nas this one. As an illustration, the government’s first set of production\nmaterials consists of nearly l3,ooo pages of documents. Assuming it\ntakes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those\nmaterials, based on the BOP’s proposed cap of three hours per day of\nreview, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of\ndocuments at the earliest by mid-November 2o2o. This is entirely\nunworkable under the schedule set by the Court.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not\nbe specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her\ndefense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 4o hours a week\nor more reviewing the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 88 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 6 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust lo, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter” or “Def. Ltr.”), requesting that the Court order the\nGovernment to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses ll months prior to trial, and\nrequesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, despite confirming to the Court that <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool), while the Court ordered\nthe Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial,\nfollouing the completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those\ncircumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District\nof New York opinion from 2oo9 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court\n' The Defense Leter states that the protective order was “entered” by the Court on July 3o, 2o2o.\nWhile that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on\nJuly 3l, 2o2o.\n> The Government’s most recent <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> transmital leter also included the months and years of\nbirth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether\nshe will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline\nfor any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 3 of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the\nIndictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the\ndefendant’s conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.*\n\nTo the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges\nagainst her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such\nmotion can be made in December with all other motions and follouing the completion of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of\nthis case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be\nmeaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. See United States v.\nMahabub, l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Ltr. at l, 3,\nshould be of litle comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to\nscrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal\nstandards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page5of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The defendant\nidentifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that,\nas detailed belou, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nin this case.\n\nRegarding the defendant’s request in connection with access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Government\nunderstands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s\nfirst <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production at the time the Defense Leter was filed—she received the materials on\nTuesday, August ll. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week. Although this\narrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and\nis subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on\nan ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this\napplication should be denied as moot.\n\nC.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the protective order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and discretion to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 2 of 5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient.

The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool732\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page5of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to litigate\na civil case.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v.

The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v.

Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 48 Filed o8/24/2o Page l of 2\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nLaura A.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August lo, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a leter motion related to two issues. Dkt. No.\n38. First, the Defendant seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense counsel\nimmediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Second, the\nDefendant seeks an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release the Defendant into\nthe general population and to provide her with increased access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED without prejudice.\nl. The Disclosure of Alleged Victims’ Identities\nThe Defendant first seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense\ncounsel immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Dkt.\nNo. 38 at l. Her request is premature. Production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which may itself identify\nalleged victims and relevant witnesses to the defense, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nnot yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding witness lists and § 35oo material. The Court is mindful of the factors pointed to by the\nDefendant—in particular the fact that charges in this mater relate to conduct that allegedly took\nplace many years ago—and anticipates that such a schedule would require the disclosure of\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 2 of 4\nalleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify\nsuch relief at this very early stage. Follouing the close of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the parties should meet and\nconfer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors. If the parties are unable to\nreach agreement as to a pretrial disclosure schedule, the Defendant may renew her request. The\ndenial is therefore without prejudice.\nI. The Defendant’s Conditions of Confinement\n\nIn her August lo, 2o2o leter motion, the Defendant also sought “an order directing\n[BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with\nincreased access to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully\nparticipate in the preparation of her defense.” Dkt. No. 38 at l. The Government responded that\nthe BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement so that she has access to\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 4l at 5. The Defendant’s\nreply credited the BOP’s change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to “confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP” and “that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the\nsame privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5.\n\nThe Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that\nallou her access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the\npreparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary.\nShould facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient\naccess to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court.\n\nThe Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell “be monitored\nin the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooool744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 4 of 4\nconditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal\nmaterials and ability to communicate with defense counsel.\n\nI.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool747\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001748.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 2 of 5\nreference, but not file, other <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material that the Government produced in this case. For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), a Court may enter a protective order\nonly after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\nprotective order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.\nSee Dkt. No. 35 at l (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating\nto the proposed protective order.”). The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a\nprovision that stated that all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt. No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o protective order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 9 l(a), lo(a), l4(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nUpon receipt of some of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Defendant filed the instant request, which\nseeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal\n? Tn the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.” In re Teligent,\nInc., 64o F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation omited). Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for\nmodification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context. See, e.g., United States v. Calderon,\nNo. 3:l5-CR-25 (JCH), 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (applying the civil standard for the\nmodification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. o7-CR-lo27 (LAP), 2ol4 WL\nl27lo346 at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2ol4) (same). See also United States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 723 (Sth Cir.\n2ol5) (applying the standard for “good cause” in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective\norder entered in a criminal case); United States v.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she\nfurnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be\nmade in those maters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order\nto allou such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those maters. In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 4 of5\n\n3. In February 2ol9, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of\nthose civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury\nsubpoenas;\n\n4. In April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”) permited the modification and, subsequently,\nanother court (“Court-2”) did not;\n\n5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-l, the\nRecipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by\nthe protective order; and\n\n6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of\nRule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this criminal mater.\n\nWith the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil\nmaters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the leter\nfiled on the public docket by the Government on this issue.

Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> will be circumvented.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide additional information in\nresponse to the Court’s prior inquiry regarding the Government’s plan to obtain and review other\ninvestigative files, created and maintained by other offices, which are related to the above-\nreferenced case. In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review. Consistent with the Government’s\ncommitment to take a thorough and transparent approach to its disclosure obligations, this leter\noutlines the relevant investigative files of which the Government is currently aware and describes\nthe Government’s approach as to each.\n\nl. Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 2 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nreturns. The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 5of8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 2 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l39 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “Favorable evidence” that\nmust be disclosed for purposes of Brady “includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the\naccused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness,” id.,\nalso knoun as “Giglio material,” as well as any statements of witnesses “which are contradictory\nor inconsistent with the government’s theory of the case.” United States v.

Rule l6\nRule l6 provides, in pertinent part:\n\nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the\n\ndefendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books, papers,\n\ndocuments, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or\n\nplaces, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is\n\nwithin the government's possession, custody, or control and. . . the\n\nitem is material to preparing the defense[.]\nFed.

Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d\nCir. l993). “The materiality standard [of Rule l6] normally is not a heavy burden; rather,\nevidence is material as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role in\nuncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting\nimpeachment or rebutal.” United States v.

The government further asserts that such disclosure will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allou delayed\ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(disclosure of certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient shouing\nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nAt the initial conference in this case, the Government promised Ms. Maxwell and the\nCourt that it would review and produce “prior investigative files from another investigation in\nthe Southern District of Florida,”! which it characterized as part of “the core of the case” against\nMs. Maxwell,” after a “careful and exhaustive and through review of all of the materials,” with\nthe “bulk” of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by “the end of this summer [2o2o].”? Summer is gone,\nWinter is coming, and the Government has failed to make good on its promises.\nAlthough it casts the October 7, 2o2o leter to the Court as a “response to the Court’s\nprior inquiry regarding” its plan to produce <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Government is, in fact, abandoning the\ndeadlines to which it already agreed and reneging on (or redefining) its assurances to the Court\nthat it would engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of questions and issues with\nrespect to actively retrieving any appropriate files.” In fact, the promised “substantial”\nproduction of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is “substantial” in size, not substance. Approximately one fourth of the\nproduction relates to materials gathered in civil litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was a party.

Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 3\n(l999); Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974) (“[A]n indictment is sufficient if it,\nfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge\nagainst which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquital or conviction in bar\nof future prosecutions for the same offense.”); Fed.R.Crim.P.7(c). An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 4\ninvestigation. The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v. Teman, No. l9-CR-696\n(PAE), 2o2o WL 3o34o34, at *43 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2o2o) (citations omited), see also, Bagley\nv. Lumpkin, 798 F.2d l297, l3ol (9th Cir. l986); United States v. Librach, 52o F.2d 55o, 554\n(8th Cir. l975).\n\nThe Government is the Team\n\nIn an atempt to minimize what it promised, the Government redefines who it believes is\non the Team. The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record\nassurances that it gave the Court on July l4, 2o2o:\n\n“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior investigative files\n\nfrom another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. l2:lo-l3\n\n“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at\n\nthe New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned and photographed to\n\nmake sure that a comprehensive review can be conducted, and they are physically in New\n\nYork so that we can have access to those files.” Jd., l4:lo-l4\n\nNou, the Government seeks to distance itself from its oun files, which are in New York,\nnot Florida, by arguing that they are excused from reviewing or producing information because it\n6 Pursuant to this Court’s practice standards regarding <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, Ms. Maxwell, on October l3, 2o2o, sent a detailed\nleter requesting the production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972). The Government has yet\nto respond.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 5\ncame from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 6\nindictment, severance of counts, disclosure of expert testimony, disclosure of materials to\npotential experts, F.R.E. 7o2 challenges to experts, and various motions in limine. Without\nsubstantive <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 7 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 7\n\nThe BOP, for their part, has only exacerbated these problems. For example, on a legal\nvisit today to review images on a laptop computer provided by the Government, we were told\nthat we could not sit on the same side of the table as Ms. Maxwell to review the images\nsimultaneously. Instead, we were directed by MDC prison guards to sit across from Ms.\nMaxwell, such that we could not see what she was reviewing or meaningfully discuss the\nmaterials.\n\nTo compound the problem, we were told by the team leader that defense counsel would\nnot be permited to pass Ms. Maxwell papers for her to review or sign. This required a break in\nthe meeting so that defense counsel could call the prosecutors to intervene. The prosecutors\nagreed to call the MDC to ensure that defense counsel could pass legal papers to Ms. Maxwell.\nBut that message was clearly not received by the MDC. After returning to the MDC, we were\ntold that we could pass Ms. Maxwell only documents that required her signature, but not\ndocuments that needed her review. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to participate in her defense\nand adequately prepare for trial if she cannot review documents prepared by her atorneys.\nAccordingly, we ask the Court to order the BOP to allou defense counsel to pass legal papers to\nMs. Maxwell for her review during prison visits.\n\nThe Government cannot discharge its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations by partially completing them.\nThe Government must fully complete them and do so on the deadlines they agreed to with the\nCourt. And it goes without saying that the Government cannot discharge its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nobligations by producing the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to defense counsel. Ms. Maxwell has a right to review all\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to participate in her oun defense. As such, she must have a complete set of\nreadable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the MDC, which she does not have. The Government has created these\nproblems by insisting on detention prior to trial. It is their burden to fix them.\n\nThe Government has not requested any relief in its leter of October 7, 2o2o. Ms.\nMaxwell anticipates that once the Government responds to her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests and after\nfurther conferrals the parties will be in a beter position to seek relief from the Court. It may be\nappropriate for the Court to schedule a status conference after November 9 to consider these\nissues.\n\nRespectfully Submited,\nJeffr¢y S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nits outside vendor to image, stamp, and dounload that electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which the Government\nfinished preparing for production last week, from an electronic database. The volume of that\nproduction is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that\nthe vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the\nGovernment has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2o2o deadline, and the vendor\nis making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next\nweek and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional\ntime beyond November 9 to finalize this production. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the\nGovernment has made numerous productions consistent with the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> schedule in this case\nand is working diligently to continue to meet the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadlines in this case.\n\nWith respect to the defense’s other claims and accusations, the Government is prepared to\nrespond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s accusations about\nthe Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally incorrect, but\nalso include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to\nreach agreement with the Government “[f]ollouing the close of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,” which has not yet\noccurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2o2o, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless\natempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, or on a faulty\ndefinition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. l3, 2o2o,\nDtk. No. 4l, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of production of witness list until shortly before\ntrial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule l6 does not require\nproduction of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65, at l-2\n(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a\ndefendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the\nGovernment)).”\n\nWith respect to the Government’s October 7 leter regarding other agency files, the\ndefense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who\nit believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the\nGovernment has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more\nGovernment may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,\nthe Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.\n\n? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense nou contends that evidence\nabout the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Atorney’s Office\nfor the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense\nmakes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that\nagreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged\nin this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense\nnevertheless believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those\narguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.\n\n> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding\nany concerns about the Government’s October 7 leter or the Government’s planned productions\nprior to filing the Defense Leter with the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter. Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions from those same Florida FBI files. (Dkt. 63 at 5, 6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthat the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts\nare already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.\n\nSecond, the Defense Leter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the\nGovernment’s control, but that the Government has nevertheless spent significant time addressing\nat the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that\nMDC staff has been instructed to allou defense counsel to pass papers to their client for her to\nreview during visits. Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal\ncounsel also noted that the table in the atorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier\ndoun the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-l9. Atorneys and clients are required to sit on\nopposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may\nbe reviewing in such a way that both the client and atorneys can view it while remaining on\nopposite sides of the table. Finally, the Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the\ndefendant has access to her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for approximately l3 hours per day and therefore receives\nmore time to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate in the MDC.\n\nXK XK XK\n\nThe Government is working expeditiously to meet its obligations and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadlines,\nwhich it takes very seriously. The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the\nproduction of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that its productions are\ncomplete. At any point, should the defense have questions or concerns about the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the\nGovernment has been and remains available to discuss any such issues directly with counsel.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nActing United States Atorney\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n> It is not clear to the Government what documents the defendant is unable to view at this point,\nbut to be clear, the technical issues have, at their worst, impacted the defendant’s ability to view\nonly a subset of the hundreds of thousands of pages produced to her. The defense has previously\nprovided the Government with lists of documents that the defendant could not open. In response,\nthe Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformated versions of each\nidentified document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on\nthe MDC computer system. Yesterday, defense counsel informed the Government that the\ndefendant still cannot view certain files, but the defense has not identified all of the specific\nunreviewable documents. In any event, the Government will continue to work with the defense\nand the MDC to ensure that the defendant can review all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe production of a subset of the electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\nproduction by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 7o Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 2\ndefense counsel indicated that they would consent to the requested extension on four conditions.\nFirst, the defense asked that the motion deadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. Second,\nthe defense asked that the Government provide the defendant with a laptop on which to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> at the Metropolitan Detention Center. Third, the defense asked that the Government\nprovide the defense with the names of the three Minor Victims listed in the Indictment by\nNovember 23, 2o2o. Fourth, the defense asked that the Government provide the defense with all\nJencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o. In response, the Government agreed to the first two\nconditions, but did not agree to the second two conditions. Accordingly, the parties have been\nunable to reach agreement on the requested two-week extension of the deadline for the Production.\n4, I hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true.\nDated: New York, New York\nNovember 6, 2o2o\nMaurene Comey .\nAssistant United States Atorney\nTelephone: (2l2) 637-2324\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v.

United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool83o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 629 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthese materials come from devices seized from Epstein’s residences, and none of the devices is\nbelieved to have belonged to the defendant. Further, of the approximately l.2 million documents\nto be produced, only a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation\nthat led to the charges in the current Indictment, ' and the Government intends to produce those\ndocuments on November 9 with the rest of the sixth production. Additionally, as a result of the\nwork being completed by the vendor, these materials will be produced to the defense in a manner\nthat is readily sortable and searchable which should facilitate and expedite its review.\nThe Government therefore respectfully requests that the Court extend the deadline for\nproduction of documents being prepared by an outside vendor to November 23, 2o2o, and that the\nCourt similarly extend the motions schedule in this case by three weeks as requested by the\ndefense.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nThe Court hereby extends the deadline for the\nGovernment's production of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nSO ORDERED. ll/9/2o from November 9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o.\nThe Court also grants the parties’ request for an\nAvi (A ie extension of the motions deadlines as follous:\nthe Defendant's motions are due by January ll,\nAlison J.

These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to provide an update regarding the\ndefendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to\nthe Court’s Order dated August 25, 2o2o. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74 Filed ll/23/2o Page 2 of 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this\ntopic, the Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page 2 of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterial. A <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list.

STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 9 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page ll of 9l ll\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl THE COURT: All right.\n\n2 (Indiscernible crosstalk)\n\n3 THE COURT: Go ahead.\n\n4 THE DEFENDANT: No. I said I have been able to\n\n5 discuss it, your Honor, with my atorney.\n\n6 THE COURT: Thank you.\n\n7 You are entitled to have the indictment read to you\n\n8 here in this open court proceeding or you can waive the public\n9 reading.

We appreciate that,\n\n6 your Honor.\n\n7 Your Honor, this is a very important proceeding for my\n8 client. It is critical and we submit, as we laid out in our\n\n9 papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law,\n\nlo none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's\n\nll presentation, she is -- she ought to be released on a bail\n\nl2 package with strict conditions, your Honor.\n\nl3 And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this\n\nl4 during the COVID crisis, with the extent of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> which was\nl5 discussed earlier in the proceeding, that's going to take the\nl6 government until November to produce to us, the notion of\n\nl7 preparing a defense with our client while she is in custody\n\nl8 under these conditions is just not realistic.\n\nl9 I would also like to take a moment, your Honor, to\n2o address a few things. As we noted in our papers, our client is\n2l not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially\n22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up\n23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to\n24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister\n25 person.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 67 of 9l 67\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl originally without prejudice obviously for precisely the\n\n2 proceeding we are having, but it sounded like you were\n\n3 suggesting that her current detention was in some way by design\n4 to prevent you from providing a full picture of her financial\n\n5 Situation. Is that the implication you are making?\n\n6 MR. COHEN: No, I am not saying that, your Honor. I\n\n7 am not going that far. What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client. It is complicated by the\nl2 COVID crisis and the other factors your Honor has pointed out\nl3 in Stephens and in Williams-—Bethea, and so it is very hard for\nl4 us to pull together this financial information, and we have\n\nl5 done it as quickly as we could before the court. But the\n\nl6 notion that my client should have been able to answer off the\nl7 top of her head the questions from Pretrial Services about a\n\nl8 real estate transaction, for example, just doesn't make any\n\nl9 sense. That's the point we are making.\n2o THE COURT: Okay.\n2l MR. COHEN: One last point in that regard, your Honor,\n22 in the schedule we set today -- thank you, your Honor, for\n23 approving that -- the government is saying that it needs at\n24 least until November to complete all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including\n25 electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. They have told us that there are two\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001945.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 68 of 9l 68\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl investigations. There is the investigation of our client and\n2 there is the investigation of Mr. Epstein. And they are, in\n\n3 the government's words, in our words together, voluminous\n\n4 materials. We haven't seen any of it yet, but voluminous,\n\n5 including voluminous electronic materials. The notion that we\n6 would be able to in any meaningful way review these with our\n\n7 client to prepare the case for motion and for trial under the\n8 current pandemic situation is just not realistic. It is not\n\n9 meaningful. It is not fair. And I should say, as your Honor\nlo noted, in the Stephens case, we are not faulting the Bureau of\nll Prisons. We are not faulting the Marshal Service. We\n\nl2 understand they are doing the best they can under the\n\nl3 circumstances. But this is just not realistic. We have\n\nl4 conduct that's alleged to be 25 years old. You have extensive\nl5 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that's going to take the government, if they hit the\nl6 deadlines your Honor set -- and we all knou that sometimes it\nl7 doesn't happen -- four and a half months to provide, and the\nl8 government wants our client to remain in custody that whole\n\nl9 time, without being able to meet with us in person, with\n2o limited access in some form of administrative seg., apparently\nal because they are afraid of what happened with Mr. Epstein, I\n22 don't knou, and it is just not a realistic way to prepare a\n23 case, particularly, your Honor, when, as we submit, the\n24 conditions and combination of conditions to secure her release\n25 can be satisfied here under your Honor's guidance.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 69 of 9l 69\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl And in response to that, the government said, well,\n\n2 too bad, COVID crisis, too bad, Ms. Maxwell, we are not going\n\n3 to let you out.

And\n\n6 they cite to your Honor, in reply, two pages of cases, very\n\n7 limited parentheticals. If you actually read those cases, they\n8 are totally different from our situation, your Honor.

In contrast, the\n\n2 defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted\n\n3 defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access\n\n4 counsel. Indeed the defense's logic, all pretrial detainees\n\n5 currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would\n\n6 need to be released to prepare their defense. To the contrary,\n7 the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure\n\n8 atorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants\n\n9 detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences\nlo with their atorneys. There is ongoing litigation before\n\nll Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the\n\nl2 adequacy of atorney-client access at the MDC. That is case\n\nl3 No. l9 Civ. 66o.

Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2; Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by ae. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, Lo investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. p reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3o of 45\nAccording to a. the security guard on duty that day had seen helicopters flying\nover the house, which he assumed to be the press. (/d.). When the guard saw the FBI\nagents walking up the driveway to the house, he again assumed that they were members of\nthe press. (/d.). Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that the press was on the\ngrounds and approaching the house. (/d.). In accordance with the procedure that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. (/d.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest; she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered. It would make\nno sense for her to try to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3l of 45\nIndeed, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of f | (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 36 of 45\n\nE. The <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up [by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . [including] flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including the entire initial tranche of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the\ngovernment represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.” The <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997).

This production includes documents and images seized from electronic devices found at\nEpstein’s residences in searches of his residences in 2ol9.

Although the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not include the grand jury subpoenas\nthemselves, the subpoena returns appear to indicate that the government began issuing\nsubpoenas for Ms. Maxwell’s financial information on August l6, 2ol9, six days after\nEpstein’s death, and issued additional subpoenas in the months that folloued. The facts\nstrongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms. Maxwell—who was\nnot named in the Epstein indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in\ntheir custody. The lack of corroboration in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> confirms that the case against Ms.\nMaxwell was an afterthought and was reverse engineered based on allegations of 25-year-\nold conduct from a small number of alleged victims.\n\nThus, notwithstanding the statement in the government's bail submission, we have\nbeen provided with no meaningful documentary corroboration in this case. It appears that\nthe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that allegedly took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration only\nreinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and strengthens her\nlong-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear her name in court. This\nfactor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms. Maxwell bail.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4l of 45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 42 of 45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.'!\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.'” These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n= Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n= Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n\" These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\nThe Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

(Dkt. 66). Despite numerous atempts\nto fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive\ncontaining these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was\nbroken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for over four months.'? Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus. As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n8 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 44 of 45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits.

Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded.

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002175.jpg": "In addition to corroborating each other, these victims’ accounts are further corroborated by\nother witnesses and by documentary evidence, which has been produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. That\nevidence will make it virtually indisputable that these victims in fact met and interacted with both\nthe defendant and Jeffrey Epstein at the times and locations they describe. Po\nevidence, additional witnesses will confirm that both the defendant and Epstein knew and\ninteracted with certain minor victims when those victims were minors. In other words, the\nGovernment’s evidence strongly corroborates the victims’ testimony that they met and interacted\nwith the defendant and Epstein at particular times and in particular places.\n\nIn the instant motion, the defendant complains that the documentary evidence relevant to\nthe three victims identified in the Indictment and produced to date is not sufficiently voluminous\n? In its Renewed Bail Motion, the defense a\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002194.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 33 of 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo2 Filed l2/23/2o Page l of l\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Eran ane\nwww.cohengresser.com\nMark S.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden\nA. The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell’s Substantial\nTies to the United States, Including Her Spouse ee\n\nThe government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new\ninformation and that the Court was “already aware of” the defendant’s friends and family in\nthe United States. (Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\nP| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearmg, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (/d. at l3-l4). The government is entirely\n* Moreover, the government failure to request regardless of whether it was legally obligated to\ndo so, shous that the government has accepted the accusers’ accounts without serious scrutiny. Given the\ngovernment’s ongoing Brady obligations, it is unsetling that the government would simply a\n‘ Contrary to the government’s assertion, the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment.\n(Gov. Mem. at lo n.l). We believe we have strong arguments that have only goten stronger with the production of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. We will be making those arguments to the Court in our pretrial motions to be filed next month.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 9 of 22\nany person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at 3o-33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2o of 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.?\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\n\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week.

Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers undercuts this claim.\n\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document ll8 Filed ol/25/2l Page 2 of 2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l4 of l9\nabout an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies, even though the Mann Act Counts\nhave nothing to do with Giuffre and are based on an entirely separate time period. The jury will\nalso need to be instructed on the elements of civil defamation and the various defenses, and they\nwill need to evaluate whether the alleged perjurious statements were material to the defamation\naction. At the time the defamation case was dismissed, more than 5o substantive motions were\npending before the District Court. Resolution of the materiality question would necessarily\ninvolve adjudicating those motions. Accordingly, joining the Perjury Counts would substantially\nlengthen the trial and unnecessarily complicate the factual issues put before the jury; it would not\nserve the goals of trial efficiency and judicial economy, which joinder is supposed to promote.\nSee Turoff, 853 F.2d at lo42-43; Werner, 62o F.2d at 928; Halper, 59o F.2d at 43o.\n\nA joint trial with the Perjury Counts would also substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell\nbecause it would necessarily introduce allegations of purported sex abuse from l999-2oo2 for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally and which is well outside of the time\nperiod alleged in the Mann Act Counts. The Palm Beach Police Department thoroughly\ninvestigated allegations of Epstein’s sexual abuse in the early-mid 2ooos and did not find any\nevidence against Ms. Maxwell. The documents produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> shou that none of the\nmore than 3o alleged victims who were interviewed in that investigation testified that they met,\ntalked to, or identified Ms. Maxwell as someone involved with Epstein’s alleged scheme.\nMoreover, had the government credited Ms. Giuffre’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, it would\nno doubt have charged Ms. Maxwell in the 2ol9 indictment, which charged Epstein alone with\nsex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. It did not. Allouing the government to introduce\npurported evidence of an uncharged and unsubstantiated conspiracy with Epstein through the\nvehicle of the Perjury Counts would be extremely prejudicial and create a substantial risk that the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 4 of 8\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) in this case is remarkable because it fails to\nidentify an accuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or\nwhen anything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). An indictment that fails to allege the essential elements of the crime\ncharged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S.\n749, 76o-6l (l962).\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 5of8\n\nIn many cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is lou. It is also true that courts\nfind, in certain cases, that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provided in connection with the mater may cure various\npleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v. Jain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635,\nat *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (“When supplemented by <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material, no additional\ninformation is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise.”). Houever, “while an\nindictment parroting the language of a federal criminal statute is often sufficient, there are crimes\nthat must be charged with greater specificity.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2 at\nlo9.\n\nThese are those crimes.\n\nHere, neither the Indictment nor the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> inform Ms. Maxwell about critical\ninformation necessary to prepare her defense. The Indictment contains multiple open-ended time\nperiods:\n\ne “from at least in or about l994, up to and including at least in or about l997”\n49 l,9, l3, l5; and\ne “beginning in at least l994” q 4.\n\nThese phrases make the time frame alleged limitless and meaningless for application of\nthe statute of limitations or any defense.\n\nIn addition to not identifying the individuals accusing Ms. Maxwell of a crime, the\nIndictment, through the use of inconsistent and vague phrases, makes it impossible to knou who\nmay, or may not, be someone that the Government claims is a “victim.”\n\ne “minor girls” ¥ l;\ne “victims” ¥ l;\ne “victims were as young as l4” § l;\ne “certain girls were in fact under the age of l8” § l;\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo23l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of 8\n\ne “some of the minor girls” { 2;\n\ne “multiple minor girls” { 4;\n\ne “Epstein’s minor victims” § 4a;\n\ne “a minor victim” § 4b;\n\ne “Among the victims ... were minor victims identified herein as Minor Victim-l,\nMinor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3.” § 7; and\n\ne “engaged in the follouing acts, among others, with respect to minor victims....”\nq 7.\n\nThe inconsistent and interchangeable use of seemingly defined alleged victims, i.e.,\nMinor Victim-l, with generic undefined “victims,” “minor victims”, and “girls,” prevents Ms.\nMaxwell from knouing what alleged conduct with what alleged person formed the basis of this\nIndictment and allous for multiple variances of proof at any trial.\n\nRandom acts are disbursed throughout the indictment, some tied to generic alleged\n“victims” other to a defined alleged “Minor Victim:”\n\ne “befriend” § 4a;\n\ne “being present” § 7a;\n\ne “groomed” 97a;\n\ne “undressing” §[7a; and\n\ne “took Minor Victim -2 to a movie” § 7b.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provides to Ms. Maxwell provides no information about when and where\nthe alleged instances of sexual abuse took place.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. Since the Government made its first <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material.

In this respect, the Government\nnotes that the trial date remains approximately six months away, the BOP was already affording\nthe defendant access to the laptop for some 65 hours a week, and the BOP was further providing\nweekend access to a desktop computer should the defendant wish to spend more than 65 hours\neach week reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nUnited States Atorney\n\nBy: __s/\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page lof3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nBy leter to the Court, dated January 25, 2o2l (Dkt.ll7 at 2-3), the MDC raised objection\nto the Court’s order, unopposed by the government, directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to\nuse on a laptop computer on weekends and holidays. (Dkt. ll6 at 2). The MDC has failed to\nstate a valid or compelling reason for opposing the Court’s directive.\n\nThe MDC does not identify any valid reason why Ms. Maxwell cannot have access to the\nlaptop computer on weekends and holidays. The MDC does not argue, for example, that access\nto the laptop cannot be provided because of issues related to safety or security, staffing, or (to\nquote the government) the need to “manag[e] its inmate population.” Instead, in opposition to\nthe Court’s order, the MDC repeats its stock response: Ms. Maxwell has received significant\namount of time to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and has more contact with counsel than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted. The MDC’s fixation on the relative time Ms. Maxwell has been given to\nreview <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is totally misguided. The government has produced millions of pages of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell has the right to review all of them in order to prepare her defense for\ntrial. To do that, she needs access to the laptop for as much time as possible, including the\nweekends and holidays because the prison computers are incapable of reading the millions of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> documents. Ms. Maxwell loses lo or more hours per week due to delay in receiving\nthe laptop, problems caused by the MDC computer, and inability to access the computer during\nmorning and afternoon counts on the weekends. Comparing Ms. Maxwell to other inmates does\nnot justify restricting her use of the laptop to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe MDC’s proposed solution—that Ms. Maxwell can simply use the prison computer on\nthe weekends and holidays to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>—is uterly inadequate. As Ms. Maxwell has\npointed out on many occasions, the prison computer is incapable of reading a significant portion\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including but not limited to native files, Excel files, some video and audio files,\nand anything requiring Cellebrite software. The MDC concedes this fact in their leter—Ms.\nMaxwell cannot review all of her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on the prison computer. And using it causes a\ncolossal waste of time. For example, if Ms. Maxwell locates a document on the prison computer\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nfor which she needs to review the native image, many of which are embedded in other files, she\nmust write doun the Bates number for that document and then wait until Monday to find the\nsame document using the laptop computer so that she can review the full document. Moreover,\nthe MDC computer shuts doun every two hours, requiring Ms. Maxwell to reboot the computer\nand find her place in the documents to resume her review. This process can take 2o-3o minutes,\nall of which is lost time. In addition, the pouer of central processing unit of the MDC computer\nis very slou. Uploading videos can take up to a half hour, time that cannot be used to review\nother documents. When the computer automatically shuts doun, videos need to be re-opened,\nrequiring Ms. Maxwell to locate the portion of the video she was viewing when the computer\nshut doun. In sum, using the prison computer is a problem, not a solution.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s review of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is challenging enough on the laptop computer that\nwas provided. Even with the laptop, Ms. Maxwell is unable to search, unable to print, and\nunable to tag or highlight documents for later review. She must review millions of pages of\nunwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at a time—with\nno filtering or organizing—and record millions of Bates numbers and notes of her review by\nhand on the limited amount of paper she is provided. And she is not permited to have any\nsupplies to organize the voluminous legal papers. Hard drives provided by the government have\nbeen mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to\nbecome degraded and unstable and to randomly shut doun. While the laptop does not solve all of\nthese issues, it performs far beter than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds\nexpended on problems caused by the electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the computers is unnecessary,\nwasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -\nto challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counsel’s claim that she needs access to the laptop on the\nweekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents\nproduced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe MDC’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell’s access to her atorneys is a reason to deny her\naccess to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely\nnothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or\ncommunicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates.\nOther inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With exception of\ninmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited\ntime to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel,\nMs. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield pouer over her, overmanage\nher, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s opposition\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to\ncounsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized. The\npandemic has made the situation even more dire. Requiring pretrial detainees, including Ms.\nMaxwell, to review terabytes of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on inadequate computers further tips an\nalready unlevel playing field to the detriment of criminal defendants.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo234o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThis leter is writen in response to Order granted on January l5, 2o2l, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center (’MDC”’) in\nBrooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of 23\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves to suppress all evidence the government obtained from a grand\njury subpoena it issued to I and to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which\nare the fruits of that unlawful subpoena.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Maxwell commited perjury during two civil depositions\nconducted by Boies Schiller in a defamation action it filed against Maxwell on behalf of one of\nthe firm’s clients. Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A Protective\nOrder entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the\ngovernment and law enforcement. Faced with that Protective Order, the government issued a\nOO —CSCSCSCSCi‘s\nSES l3) proceeding ex parte, the government\nensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations\nin support of its application.\n\nThe government then took full advantage.\nOO —SSC‘\nOO —CSCSCSCSC‘ieie‘\nOO —SSCSCSCSSCies\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘C‘i\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘(‘CCCS\nOO ——SCSCis\nOO —CtisSCSCSCies«S\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\n\nGiuffre, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill batle—even she\nwas constrained to acknouledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 46, 5l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (explaining that <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> was “hard-fought” and “extensive” and\nnoting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,\ntotals in the “thousands of pages”).\n\nGiuffre sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about\nMaxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual maters. Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> exchanged between\nthe parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective\nOrder included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality\ndesignation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any\ninformation or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that\n“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the\npreparation and trial of this case and any related mater, including but not limited to,\ninvestigations by law enforcement.” Ex. B J l(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\nthis proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order. Ex. A.” To the contrary, the\norder strictly limited the parties’ disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion\nof the case. In particular, paragraph l2 of the order provided that:\n\n[a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each\n\ndocument and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL\n\nshall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties\n\nmay elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to\n\ndestroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties\n\nwith an affidavit confirming destruction.\n\nEx. A § l2.\n\nB. Maxwell’s April and July 2ol6 depositions\n\nRelying on the confidentiality protections of the Protective Order, Maxwell declined to\ninvoke her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and agreed to testify at her April\n2ol6 deposition.

In support of the\nmotion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that “[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as\nconfidential under the Protective Order in this case.”\n\n* This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this\ninformation by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential\nmaterial to the media, other false claimants, and the government.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 23\n\nContrary to the government’s misrepresentations, J did foment the\ninvestigation (or at least it tried to).

So did the district court in permiting\nthese intrusions and ordering Maxwell to sit for a second deposition. Maxwell likewise relied on\nthe Protective Order in choosing to render such intimate details, rather than assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege as she had every right to do.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t Maxwell have relied on the Protective Order? The central protection\nin the Order was that none of Maxwell’s answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies\nSchiller had expressly sought a law enforcement exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law\nfirm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell’s option, to destroy it.\nMaxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if J did not.\n\n2. The government circumvented the protective order.\n\nFaced with a duly entered Protective Order—which quite deliberately omited any “law\nenforcement” exception—the government had lawful options to pursue the confidential Giuffre\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. It could have moved to intervene in the civil case and to amend the Protective Order.\nIt could have issued a subpoena for the materials and given Maxwell an opportunity to respond.\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 294. It could even have applied for a search warrant, assuming\n(counterfactually) that it could shou probable cause in support of such a warrant.\n\nThe government did none of those things.

According to\nthe prosecution, these false statements were made in a civil defamation lawsuit against Ms.\nMaxwell when she responded to questions in her depositions on April 22, 2ol6 (Count Five) and\nwas compelled by court order, with the promise of confidentiality by the Court and plaintiff's\ncounsel, to respond to additional, immaterial questions in a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6\n(Count Six). These counts fail, as a mater of law, because the questions posed were ambiguous,\nthe answers given were true, and both the questions and answers were immaterial to the\ndefamation action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nI. The Underlying Civil Defamation Action\n\nA. Plaintiffs Claims\n\nIn 2ol5, Virginia Roberts Giuffre filed an action in this District alleging that Ghislaine\nMaxwell had defamed her. The alleged defamation centered on a statement from Ms. Maxwell’s\natorney denying as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Ms. Giuffre’s demonstrably false claims about\nher relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and others, including that she had been sexually trafficked\nto foreign presidents and award-winning scientists. The complaint alleged generally that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Giuffre between l999 and 2oo2 and that Epstein abused more than 3o girls\nbetween 2ool and 2oo7.'\n\nOver the course of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the defamation action, it became obvious that Giuffre\n(and her lawyers) had lied or misstated critical facts including, inter alia, her age, the various\n\n' See Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l5-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y), Doc. # ool at ¥ 9.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo24l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 27\nyou're talking about” and an inability to “list” (sixteen years after the fact) “all of the people\nunder the age of l8” that she interacted with at “any of Jeffrey [Epstein’s] property.”\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell had refused, on advice of counsel, to answer irrelevant questions at\nthat April 2ol6 deposition that concerned her consensual adult sexual activity with others\nincluding Mr. Epstein, Ms. Giuffre’s counsel sought a second deposition a short time later. Ms.\nMaxwell opposed the second deposition and argued that her private adult consensual sexual\nactivity had no relation to the defamation lawsuit. Ultimately, i\nSSS\nOO e—CSSCSCSCSCies\nOO e—CSCSC‘CCSCies\ni —“‘CSCSCies\nOO —CSCSCSCSCSCisis\nOO —SSCSCCs\nOO —C—C—CSCSCSCs‘itis\nSCC‘\ni —SSCSCiCs\n—“CsSCis\n\nMs. Maxwell sat for this second deposition on July 22, 2ol6. The testimony was marked\n“Confidential.” Again, plaintiff vastly exceeded the bounds of the permited topics, including in\nthe questions that are quoted in Count 6 of the Indictment. The excerpts reproduced in the\nIndictment, as with Count 5, similarly ignore the questions, answers, and objections that\noccurred over the course of the deposition, as well as other objections in the case concerning the\nrelevant time frame for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> purposes.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo24l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 24 of 27\nII. None of the Questions or Answers Were Material\n\nA. Materiality\n\nSection l623(a) of Title l8 of the U.S. Code states, in relevant part, that “[w]hoever\nunder oath ... in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United\nStates knouingly makes any false material declaration” shall be subject to criminal penalty\n(emphasis added). Thus, to violate § l623(a), a perjurious statement must be “material to the\nproceeding in which it is given.” United States v. Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to\nlead to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v. Stern, No. o3 Cr. 8l, 2oo3 WL 22743897, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2o, 2oo3).\n\nAlthough issues of materiality are generally mixed questions of law and fact normally left\nto a jury, see Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23, under certain circumstances, like those presented in\nthis case, a court can decide this issue under Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a trial will\nnot assist in determining whether the Government can prove to a reasonable juror that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct violated l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). United States v. Nitschke, 843 F.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.

Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.

Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the\nunderlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\nprosecutions for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and an evidentiary hearing on the issue.

Nor does the NPA contain any language limiting its binding effect on other USAOs,\nas standard agreements typically do.\n\nB. The Negotiation of the NPA\n\nUnlike standard non-prosecution agreements, the NPA here was heavily negotiated.\nNegotiations began in January 2oo7, lasted for a period of eight months, and were “extensive.”\nIn re Wild, 955 F.3d ll96, ll98-99 (llth Cir.), reh’g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 967\nF.3d l285 (llth Cir. 2o2o). <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> has revealed tha t\n\nin aon, as\nLT\neee\n\nIt is our understanding that the negotiations involved the entire hierarchy of the USAO\nfor the SDFL, all of whom signed off on the NPA. <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> indicates that\nLT\nLT\nPY Further, the investigation leading up to the NPA was not\nlimited to the SDFL: A privilege log produced by the government in civil litigation indicates\nthat the USAO-SDFL involved the USAO for this District in its investigation of Epstein, and that\natorneys from the USAO-SDFL traveled to New York and interviewed and/or subpoenaed New\nYork-based witnesses.

NPA at 2 (noting that Epstein “seeks to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability”).

Ready,\n82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996) (internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v.\nMozer, 828 F.

Even if there\nwere ambiguity, which there is not, that ambiguity must be construed against the government and\nin favor of the defense. Accordingly, the indictment must be dismissed. In the alternative, Ms.\nMaxwell should be permited to take <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> regarding the intent of the parties to the NPA\nwith respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, and the Court should hold an evidentiary\nhearing in aid of this Motion.\n\nI. The Indictment Should Be Dismissed for Breach of the NPA.\n\n“Plea agreements have long been interpreted in accordance with contract law principles.”\nUnited States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 269 (2d Cir. 2oo4). “In interpreting whether a plea\nagreement has been breached, this court looks to the reasonable understanding of the parties as to\nthe terms of the agreement.” /d. at 269-7o (internal quotations and citations omited). Houever,\nthe government “must bear the burden for any lack of clarity in the agreement and ambiguities\nshould be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Innes v. Dalsheim, 864 F.2d 974, 979 (2d Cir.\nl988). Here, the NPA unambiguously precludes prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators, and the indictment in this case must be dismissed.\n\nIn support of its July 2o2o motion for Ms. Maxwell’s detention, the government raised\nthree arguments why it contends the NPA does not bar Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution: (l) that Ms.\nMaxwell supposedly lacks standing to enforce the NPA; (i) that the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision applies only in the SDFL; and (i) that the provision is limited to conduct occurring\nduring the 2ool-o7 time period and to violations of statutes specifically referenced in the NPA.\nGovernment’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Reply Mem.”), Dkt. No. 22 (filed\nJul. l3, 2o2o), at 5. None of these arguments has merit.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo259l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 33 of 38\ncourts/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-epstein-aide/2495762/). And the government has\nacknouledged, by omission, that one of the three alleged victims referenced in the current\nindictment was interviewed by the USAO for the SDFL. See Reply Mem. at 6 (“two of the\nvictims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL’”).\n\nAs noted above, Epstein and his counsel sought to prevent prosecution against his\nputative co-conspirators to the maximum extent possible. Had the government intended to limit\nthat protection to a specific time period or to violations of specific statutes, it could have done so.\nIt did not. Thus, by charging Ms. Maxwell with conduct in which she allegedly engaged as part\nof a conspiracy with Epstein—conduct that predates the NPA—the government has violated the\nNPA.\n\na\n\nIn sum, none of the three arguments proffered by the government regarding the\napplicability of the NPA is meritorious. Ms. Maxwell is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA\nwith standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision. The co-conspirator immunity\nprovision binds all USAQOs and is not limited to the SDFL. It imposes no limitation on the scope\nof covered conduct—and even if it did, the conduct alleged here would be covered. At most, the\nco-conspirator immunity provision is ambiguous, and thus must be construed against the\ngovernment. Because the co-conspirator immunity provision bars the government’s prosecution\nof Ms. Maxwell on charges arising out of her alleged conspiracy with Epstein, the indictment\nshould be dismissed.\n\nI. In the Alternative, the Court Should Permit <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> and Conduct an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nThe language of the NPA and the facts submited herewith are more than sufficient for\nthe Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, particularly when any\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 34 of 38\nambiguities are construed, as they must be, against the government as drafter. In the alternative,\nhouever, the NPA and the circumstances of its execution merit <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and an evidentiary\nhearing regarding the parties’ intent.\n\nTo the extent that extrinsic materials do not make the parties’ intent clear, the Court is\nobligated to make a finding as to the parties’ “reasonable understanding,” with ambiguities\nresolved in Ms. Maxwell’s favor. See Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 27o (emphasis and citation\nomited). Courts in this circuit have routinely recognized the need for evidentiary hearings\nwhere the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement is in genuine\ndispute. See, e.g., id. at 27o (noting testimony from defendant’s atorney); United States v.\nAleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo2) (remanding where “the district court failed to make a\nrecord that allous us to determine the existence, scope and effect of an immunity agreement”);\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 67l (noting that district court heard testimony from two prosecutors,\ndefendant, and defendant’s counsel as of the time the plea agreement was reached); United States\nv. Papa, 533 F.2d 8l5, 82o (2d Cir. l975) (describing “two evidentiary hearings”); United States\nv. Satar, No. o2 Cr. 395 (JGK), 2oo3 WL 225lo398, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2oo3) (noting\nconclusion that “an evidentiary hearing was warranted . . . to determine whether an agreement\nexisted, what its terms were, and whether there was compliance with those terms”).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s request for an evidentiary hearing, and for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, is at least as strong\nas that in Feldman. There, the district court denied <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to a defendant who claimed that\nthe government had served a writ of execution in violation of oral representations made in\nconnection with the defendant’s plea agreement, holding that the agreement’s merger provision\nbarred the consideration of any oral agreements or representations.

We have long recognized that plea agreements are significantly different from\ncommercial contracts.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (emphasis added). The court explained:\n\nGovernment conduct in negotiating plea agreements must comport with the\n\nhighest standard of fairness. Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental constitutional rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\nperformance.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “sufficient in these circumstances” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\nprotection from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n: Julie K.

Without this basic information, Ms. Maxwell\ncannot adequately investigate the allegations against her and prepare for trial.\n\nThe voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provided by the government, which totals in the millions of\npages—the vast majority of which was produced to the defense in November 2o2o—does not\nshed any more light on the nature of the government proof or the specifics of the alleged\nconduct.” The <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> contains only a handful of documents that even pertain to the time\nperiod charged in the indictment (l994-l997), and what litle exists offers almost no information\nabout the details of, for example, exactly when and where the alleged incidents of sexual abuse\ntook place, who was allegedly present, and hou the alleged conduct violated the law. Without\nthese details, which Ms. Maxwell is requesting through a bill of particulars, she cannot identify\nrelevant witnesses or documents that she may wish to obtain to prepare her defense.\n\nIt is clear that the detail about hou these alleged offenses took place will come solely\nfrom the statements of the government’s witnesses. Accordingly, it is critical that Ms. Maxwell\nreceive Jencks Act material and the government’s witness list, as well as 4o4(b) evidence, well\nin advance of trial so that she can conduct an adequate investigation. The unique circumstances\nof this case more than warrant early disclosure of this material. The conduct alleged in the\nindictment dates back 25 years, making investigation and preparation of the case complex and\ndifficult. The global COVID-l9 pandemic adds further complications and obstacles to trial\npreparation. The Court has recognized that Ms. Maxwell should be granted ample time to\nreview documents related to witnesses in this case.

Strawberry, 892 F. Supp. 5l9, 526 (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not\nknouing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not knou who\nhas accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here. See\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975);° United States v. Warme, No.\nO9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y.

In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a bill of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit concluded that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574. Asa result, Bortnovsky held, “[t]he relevance of key events was\nshrouded in mystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial.” Jd. at 575.\n\nMs. Maxwell is similarly hindered. The indictment charges Ms. Maxwell with enticing\nor arranging travel for an unidentified individual, Accuser-l,* from Florida to New York at some\npoint during a four-year period. Yet the government has not alleged the dates of Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged interactions with Accuser-l, the dates when Accuser-l allegedly traveled across state\nlines for the purpose of engaging in sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, the dates on which\nMs. Maxwell allegedly enticed the complainant to do so, and the actions Ms. Maxwell allegedly\ntook to entice Accuser-l to travel. Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3.

Documents Related to Ms. Maxwell’s Motions\n\nAlong with this motion, Ms. Maxwell has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for\nbreach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein and two motions to\nsuppress the evidence obtained from the government’s subpoena of ae. These\nmotions request, as alternative relief, that the Court grant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and an evidentiary hearing\non the issues bearing on the motions.

Ms. Maxwell seeks a copy of the subpoena to determine whether she has a basis to\nchallenge it.\n\nLikewise, for the reasons set forth in her motion to suppress, Ms. Maxwell requests that\nthe government produce copies of the other grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with this\ncase for the production of Ms. Maxwell’s private and confidential records. °\nIII.

Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9 (l995), United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667\n(l985), and Giglio v.

It is further requested that the Court direct the\ngovernment to disclose such information immediately upon its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nIt is well setled that pursuant to Brady and its progeny, the government must\ndisclose evidence, information, and facts that could be used to impeach its witnesses. See\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 225 (2d Cir. 2oo7). Such evidence includes any\nand all evidence of a witness’ prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent\nstatements, and statements demonstrating a lack of knouledge or a denial of the facts of the\ncase or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct from which it\ncan be inferred the witness is untruthful.\n\nBut disclosure of Brady material is not the end of the line. Quite the contrary, it is a\nlaunching point for an investigation that may bear critical information. In order to mount an\neffective defense, Ms. Maxwell must receive this material in sufficient time to investigate\nand develop it for effective use before and during trial. We therefore request the immediate\ndisclosure of all Brady and Giglio material.\n\nThe government takes the customary position that it will turn over any Gig/io material at\nthe time it provides prior statements of witnesses pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. In doing so, the\ngovernment erroneously assumes that Gig/io material is something other than Brady material.\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that impeachment evidence “falls within the Brady rule.”\nBagley, 473 U.S. at 676 (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54).

Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the procedure enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002727.jpg": "__ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l58 Filed o2/o5/2l Page l of 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002742.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l62 Filed o2/26/2l Page l of 2\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\noe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\"). Under the Bail\n« Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a\nclass B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation.\n\n7 What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a\ndozen years after the period of the conspiracy alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Pageloofl8\nReform Act, Ms. Maxwell must be released unless there are \"no conditions\" that would\nreasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage each day Ms.\nMaxwell remains in custody — her case is tried daily in the court of public opinion based\non allegations that are inadmissible in a court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who\nare not implicitly biased against her is being severely jeopardized; her physical strength\nand concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by the conditions of her\nconfinement; and she is being denied a full and fair opportunity to prepare her case for\ntrial.®\n8 Ms. Maxwell continues to experience difficulty reviewing electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including discs that can only be\nreviewed on the MDC computer but are not readable on that computer, and thousands of pages still not readable on\neither the MDC computer or the laptop. Her receipt of legal mail — including pretrial motions, responses and replies\n—are constantly delayed even after tracking information confirms delivery to the MDC. The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena. The Defendant’s motion to authorize\nservice of the Subpoena on BSF should be denied.!\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas\nin criminal proceedings. Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\nl A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to intervene\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 Filed o3/26/2l Page5of7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 22, 2o2l\nPage 5 of 7\nthan impeachment, many of them are procurable from the Government and are thus improper\nsubjects of a Rule l7(c) subpoena, as explained belou.\n\nRequests 2 through 5 also seek communications from 2ol5 through the present between\nBSF, its co-counsel, and the U.S. Atorney about Jean Luc Brunel, who is presently incarcerated\nin France on charges of sex crimes and is one of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s\nco-conspirators. But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS¥’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o, 2o2o),\nECF No. lo8 (“[P]laintiff produced certain pages from a diary dated in early l996 which detailed,\nonly, that Jeffrey Epstein had held her hand in a movie theater in late l995 which made her feel\nuncomfortable. This same diary contained exactly zero references to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary\nto the assertions in her Complaint . . . .” (emphasis in original)).\n\nRequest l2 for “EVCP Material” is not relevant to the Defendant’s defense. BSF submited\nclaims and supporting evidence to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of\nseveral Epstein survivors who have not made separate claims against Maxwell.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government writes to notify the Court that today, a Grand Jury siting in Manhatan\nreturned a superseding indictment in the above-captioned case (the “S2 Indictment”).! The\nGovernment respectfully submits this leter (l) to identify the differences between the charges\ncontained in the S2 Indictment and the charges contained in the prior indictment, Sl 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJIN) (the “Sl Indictment’); (2) to address the impact, if any, of the S2 Indictment on the status\nof <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and other disclosures; and (3) to address the impact of the S2 Indictment on the\ncurrently pending motions.\n\n' The Government noted in its February 26, 2o2l Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition\nto the Defendant’s Pretrial Motions that its investigation remained ongoing and that the\nGovernment would seek a superseding indictment no later than three months prior to trial. At this\njuncture, while the Government’s investigation is still ongoing, if trial remains set for July l2,\n2o2l as scheduled, then the Government does not intend to seek any further indictments in this\ncase. To the extent the Government uncovers additional evidence that it may seek to introduce at\ntrial, it will promptly disclose such evidence to the defense as either Rule l6 or Jencks Act material.\nAdditionally, the Government remains cognizant that its Brady obligations remain ongoing and\nwill promptly disclose any exculpatory evidence of which it becomes aware.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl88 _ Filed o3/29/2l Page3of5\nPage 3\n\nCount Six of the S2 Indictment adds another new charge against the defendant. In\nparticular, Count Six alleges that the defendant participated in the sex trafficking of a minor, and\naided and abeted the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l and 2. The S2 Indictment\nspecifically identifies Minor Victim-4 as the victim of this count.\n\nCount Seven of the S2 Indictment is identical to Count Five of the Sl Indictment and is\notherwise unchanged.\n\nCount Eight of the S2 Indictment is identical to Count Six of the Sl Indictment and is\notherwise unchanged.\n\nIl. Disclosures\n\nThe Government has already produced to the defense all material that constitutes Rule l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> related to the new allegations and charges contained in the S2 Indictment. In particular,\nthe Government has from the outset approached its Rule l6 productions in this case as though the\nallegations covered a broader time period through at least 2oo5, rather than limiting those\nproductions to the time period alleged in the Sl Indictment (l994 to l997). As a result, the\nGovernment has already produced to the defense all Rule l6 material relevant to the S2 Indictment\nof which it is aware in the Prosecution Team’s possession. These Rule l6 materials included\nproductions from the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”), the FBI New York Office, and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York.\n\nTo assist the defense in preparing for trial on the new allegations contained in the S2\nIndictment, today the Government provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s month and year of\nbirth. Additionally, in order to aid the defense in its trial preparation and review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2869\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl88 _ Filed o3/29/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\ntoday the Government provided the defense with a list of Bates ranges within the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials produced to date that are particularly relevant to Minor Victim-4. Although that list is\nnot exhaustive and does not include every document that may be relevant to Minor Victim-4, it\nidentifies key pieces of evidence regarding this victim.\n\nAdditionally, in order to ensure that the defense has adequate time to prepare for trial, the\nGovernment intends to begin its production to the defense of non-testifying witness statements by\nApril l2, 2o2l, approximately three months in advance of trial. This production will include the\nstatements of more than 25o witnesses related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and his\nassociates in the Government’s possession whom the Government does not currently expect to call\nto testify at trial. The Government is continuing to review its files for witness statements and will\nproduce any additional non-testifying witness statements that come to light on a rolling basis as\npromptly as possible in advance of trial.\n\nFinally, given the expanded charges in the S2 Indictment, the Government is prepared to\nproduce Jencks Act and Giglio material for witnesses it expects to call at trial six weeks, rather\nthan four weeks, in advance of trial. These productions, together with the guidance provided to\nthe defense today regarding <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> relating to Minor Victim-4, should provide ample time for\nthe defense to prepare for trial and proceed as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nII.

The\nSubpoena, which seeks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and\nBSF’s submissions on behalf of its clients to an independent claims program administered by\nJeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent atempt to further this false narrative and to fish for\npotential impeachment material. But a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material goes\nwell beyond the scope of a permissible Rule l7(c) subpoena. The Defendant’s motion to authorize\nservice of the Subpoena on BSF should be denied.!\n\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE l7(C)\n\nRule l7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas\nin criminal proceedings. Rule l7(c) “was not intended to provide a means of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for criminal\ncases.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698 (l974); see also, e.g., United States v. Barnes,\n56o F. App’x 36, 39 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“Rule l7 subpoenas are properly used to obtain admissible\nevidence, not as a substitute for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553\n(S.D.N.Y. l995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seek production of\ndocuments or other materials which, although not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible\nevidence,” criminal “Rule l7(c) cannot be used to obtain leads as to the existence of additional\ndocumentary evidence or to seek information relating to the defendant’s case” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule l7(c) subpoena must demonstrate:\n\n(l) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise\n\nprocurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the\n: A motion to quash the Subpoena is not yet ripe because, without having the benefit of the\nDefendant’s sealed briefing on her motion and any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the\nCourt has not granted Defendant’s motion for an order authorizing service of the Subpoena on\nBSF. The Court, houever, should exercise its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See\nUnited States v. Weissman, No. ol Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2oo2 WL l467845, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2oo2) (“Rule l7(c) expressly commits the decision whether to require pre-trial production of\ndocuments to the sound discretion of the court.”). Should the Court wish to hear further from BSF\nprior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear before the Court and/or move to intervene\nand to quash the Subpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl9l Filed o3/3o/2l Page5of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But Brunel does not appear to be relevant to any of the Government’s charges in\nthe indictment in this case, and, again, communications from 2ol5 are not relevant to conduct that\noccurred between l994 and l997. The Defendant thus seeks these communications, too, so that\nshe can fish for impeachment materials.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF and\nAnnie Farmer and her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The fact that the\nFarmers are represented, and the terms of their representation, is not relevant to whether the\nDefendant commited the crimes of which she is accused. Even the impeachment value of such\ndocuments is speculative. Maria Farmer is not one of the minor victims described in the indictment,\nand thus may not be called to testify in this case. And in seeking to determine whether BSF has\ncontingency fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seek to establish some\nmotive of BSF to drum up contingency fees by convincing women to falsely accuse the Defendant\nof criminal conduct. But BS/’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3o, 2o2o),\nECF No. lo8 (“[P]laintiff produced certain pages from a diary dated in early l996 which detailed,\nonly, that Jeffrey Epstein had held her hand in a movie theater in late l995 which made her feel\nuncomfortable. This same diary contained exactly zero references to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary\nto the assertions in her Complaint . . . .” (emphasis in original)).\n\nRequest l2 for “EVCP Material” is not relevant to the Defendant’s defense. BSF submited\nclaims and supporting evidence to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of\nseveral Epstein survivors who have not made separate claims against Maxwell. The Defendant\nmust demonstrate the relevance of all the evidence she seeks by means of a Rule l7(c) subpoena,\nnot merely that she could turn up something that is relevant and admissible.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Pagelofil\ncS U.S. Department of Justice\nSE?

Background\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million\npages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> pursuant to the Government’s various <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, including Rule\nl6.

Unlike the rules of civil procedure—\npermiting the issuance of subpoenas to seek production of documents or materials which, although\nthemselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize\nthe issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule l7. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F.\nSupp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995); United States v.

(Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information\nprovided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant’s\nconfinement over the last two months.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to both a\ndesktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on\nwhich to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the\nMDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her atorneys.! This <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review\n' Per BOP policy, all inmate emails are routinely purged every six months. In response to\ncomplaints from the defendant and defense counsel regarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC\nstaff examined the defendant’s inmate email account. That examination revealed that the\ndefendant had herself deleted some of her emails and had archived others. That examination\nrevealed no evidence to suggest that MDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l97 Filed o4/o7/2l Page 2 of5\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Even the guards resort to drinking botled water.\n\nBlaming Ms. Maxwell for the filth of her severely restricted environment is uterly\nmisplaced. To suggest she willingly lives in squalor is absurd. In an effort to wield pouer, the\nguards use cleaning as a punishment. The MDC - especially the East Building where Ms.\nMaxwell is held— is permeated with mold and vermin. Cockroaches and rodents are plentiful and\nglue tracks have been placed in Ms. Maxwell’s day area to help remediate the problem.\n\nWhile HEPA filters may improve the safety of the legal visiting rooms — characterized by\nan HVAC inspector as “‘a death trap” — in-person visiting with Ms. Maxwell is uncomfortable\nand unproductive. Relegated to a small “fishboul” where chairs abut glass walls and a table,\nwith no room in between, Ms. Maxwell and counsel are forced to wedge their bodies into chairs.\nThere is no opportunity to view electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or exchange documents; and speaking while\nwearing a face mask while crammed on either side of a plexiglass divider under surveillance of\nthree guards and a handheld camera places a chill on any free exchange of confidential\ninformation. While video conferencing has facilitated on-going communication between Ms.\nMaxwell and counsel, her request for a legal call to confer with counsel regarding pretrial\nmotions was denied.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s health is deteriorating. She has not experienced sunshine and fresh air for\nthe past eight months. Referring to an interior gated pen where Ms. Maxwell can exercise (and\nbe subjected to even more searches) as the “outside” is a misnomer. Barely a breeze permeates\nthat area.\n\nMedical staff monitor Ms. Maxwell’s health by recording her weight in her medical\nchart.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video. We request that the Court direct the government to provide defense counsel with\nthat video. In response to any misconduct of guards, the standard reply is that “the mater will be\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l97 Filed o4/o7/2l Page 4of5\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Even a Federal Express envelope from the government\nwas not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> disc that\nwas unreadable. In mid-March, she received a copy of the New York Times issued in October.\nAny claim that Ms. Maxwell deletes CorrLinks emails, which is disputed, does litle to erase the\nfact that the MDC violated its oun policy by prematurely deleting Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails.\nThat her food is not heated in a thermal oven does litle to explain why she was given a salad\ncontaining mold earlier this week.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not have an eye mask; she’s not even provided a suitable face mask.\nShe covers her eyes with a touel to shield them from glaring overhead lighting that she cannot\nturn off and from flashlights pointed into her cell every l5 minutes during the night. That Ms.\nMaxwell chooses not to respond to guards during the nightime is no indication that she is\nengaged in restful sleep; rather, it’s a respite from having to engage with them.\n\nNo amount of gloss put on Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement can erase the fact\nthat she remains in de facto solitary confinement, over-managed by multiple guards, and\nsurveilled by multiple cameras 24 hours per day. The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial.

The Government then conducted two preliminary interviews with\nMinor Victim-4 by video teleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the difficult nature\nof the interview topics, houever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4\nover video. Due to travel constraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic,\nthe Government was unable to travel to meet with Minor Victim-4, who resides more than a day’s\ndrive away from New York, until January 2o2l. The Government then conducted multiple in-\nperson interviews with Minor Victim-4, which concluded near the end of January 2o2l. Over the\nnext two months, the Government worked expeditiously to conduct additional investigation to\ncorroborate Minor Victim-4, including by interviewing additional witnesses, reviewing documents\nthat had already been produced to the defense in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and subpoenaing additional records,\nwhich the Government promptly produced to the defense upon receipt. After taking those\ninvestigative steps, the Government completed the necessary internal processes to prepare a\nsuperseding indictment, which it presented to the grand jury in late March, or approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges. The suggestion that the Government\nintentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in\nfact.! Nor is there any merit to the defense’s equally baseless suggestions that the Government\n' The defense’s implication that the S2 Indictment somehou reflects an acknouledgment of the\nstrength of the defense’s pretrial motions is similarly baseless and entirely illogical. Were that the\ncase, and if the Government could have (as the defense incorrectly speculates) obtained this\nindictment any time it wished, then it would make far more sense for the Government to obtain\nthe S2 Indictment in the first place or, at bare minimum, immediately upon receiving the defense\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\ndefense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l. As noted in its March 29, 2o2l\nleter to the Court, the Government has already produced to the defense all material of which it is\naware that constitutes Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> related to the new allegations in the S2 Indictment. This\nincludes material that was already in the files of the FBI, which the Government produced during\nits Fall 2o2o productions, and new material obtained during the Government’s investigation, which\nthe Government has produced on a rolling basis as it has received such material. Additionally, the\nGovernment provided the defendant with a list of Bates ranges within the past <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproductions that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4, which should substantially assist the\ndefense in re-reviewing relevant materials and preparing for trial. In other words, this is not a\nsuperseding indictment that requires a huge production of new <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the defense will need\ntime to review. To the contrary, the defense already had in its possession Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nrelevant to the S2 Indictment for months.\n\nThe Government plans to begin producing non-testifying witness statements on April l2,\n2o2l. With these productions, the defense will have access to statements of witnesses whom the\nGovernment does not intend to call at trial, thereby providing the defense multiple months during\nwhich it can decide whether it wishes to call any of these individuals. Further, the Government\nplans to produce Jencks Act and Giglio material for testifying witnesses six weeks in advance of\ntrial, which will provide the defense with far more time than is typical in this District for review\nof such material. Given that the defense has had <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case for months, will have\nmonths with non-testifying witness statements, and will have more than one month with Jencks\nAct and Giglio material, there is every reason to believe that the defense will provide excellent\nrepresentation to the defendant at trial as scheduled beginning July l2, 2o2l.\n\nIn light of the ample time that remains before trial and the steps the Government has\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page6eof8\nPage 6\n\ncommited to taking to aid the defense in preparing for trial, the Government anticipates objecting\nto any request to adjourn trial, should one be made. The Government contacted defense counsel\non March 29, 2o2l to convey its availability for a call to discuss some of the issues above as well\nas a supplemental briefing schedule for certain of the defendant’s pending motions, among other\nissues. Although such a call has not yet taken place, the Government remains available to confer\nwith the defense regarding these issues, as well as a schedule for trial-related filings such as\nmotions in limine and requests to charge. Indeed, the Government and defense counsel have\nconferred extensively by email over the last several days regarding defense requests to review\ncertain physical evidence and other defense inquiries regarding <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case. As a result\nof this conferral, the Government has scheduled an evidence review session for the defendant and\ndefense counsel to review physical evidence in the custody of the FBI relating to this case in the\ncoming days. The Government will continue to be available to confer with defense counsel and is\nprepared to discuss scheduling maters whenever the defense would like.\n\nFinally, nothing about the S2 Indictment supports reconsideration of this Court’s three\nprior decisions ordering the defendant detained pending trial. If anything, the arguments in favor\nof detention are nou stronger. The defendant nou faces two additional charges, which increase\nthe maximum penalty she faces to eighty years in prison. She also faces even more evidence,\nincluding a fourth victim, who is corroborated by independent evidence, including other witnesses\nand documents such as travel records, phone records, shipment records, and items recovered\nduring the execution of a search warrant. Moreover, as the defense seems to implicitly recognize,\nthe S2 Indictment undermines certain legal arguments the defense previously made in atacking\nthe prior indictment in this case. (See Dkt. No. l92 at 2 (“The timing suggests that the decision to\nsupersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial motions and government concern about\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo29l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\n\nthe nou-apparent weakness of its case.”’”)). Taken together, these factors all point to the conclusion\nthat the defendant nou faces an even stronger case with even more severe consequences upon\nconviction. The S2 Indictment thus further increases the defendant’s incentives to flee, and it does\nnothing to alter the other factors that the Court previously found weigh in favor of detention,\nincluding the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, skill at evading detection, and prior lack of candor\nwith the Court.\n\nThe Government has no objection to an in-person arraignment, but the Government objects\nto the defense request for yet another bail hearing. The defense has nou had three bites at that\nparticular apple and is currently appealing the issues raised therein to the Second Circuit, where\nargument is scheduled to take place on April 26, 2o2l. The introduction of additional charges,\nreflecting additional evidence, in no way supports a fourth argument for release, and the Court\nshould not entertain yet another application under these circumstances, especially when this very\nissue is currently before the Circuit. Certainly, the fact that a grand jury has found probable cause\nto believe that the defendant has commited even more crimes does not somehou suggest that the\nGovernment’s case is in any way weaker than it was at the time of the prior three bail applications.\nTo the contrary, the detailed allegations in the S2 Indictment make clear that there is nou more\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nNor does anything about the S2 Indictment support the defense request that the Court take\nthe extraordinary step of holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue of bail. “It is well established\nin this circuit that proffers are permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation\ncontexts.” United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are\ntypically informal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Often the opposing parties\nsimply describe to the judicial officer the nature of their evidence; they do not actually produce\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page8sof8\nPage 8\nit.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, in this Circuit, District Courts regularly\naccept the Government’s proffer regarding its evidence when considering a bail application. And\nhere, of course, the Court has not only the Government’s proffer but also the grand jury’s\ndetermination that probable cause exists as to each of the charged offenses. Defense counsel’s\nrequest to deviate from that ordinary practice appears to be a thinly veiled atempt at a fishing\nexpedition through which the defense hopes to obtain early Jencks Act material and a pretrial\nopportunity to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses, including victims of sexual abuse. It\nis to avoid such a fishing expedition, among other reasons, that courts in this Circuit proceed by\nproffer when considering bail motions. See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir.\nl986) (“a detention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial . . . or as a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> tool for the\ndefendant”). The S2 Indictment offers no reason to deviate from that practice.\n%* %* %*\n\nFor the reasons above, the Government respectfully submits that trial can and should\nproceed as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“[O]f the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2927\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002928.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 4 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Al//\ncounsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance.\nThe government’s challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense.\nDefending quarter-century-old allegations has required investigation across this country and\naround the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same efforts and diligence.\nIt is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the\nindictment and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n\"critically review voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for the new time period and charges;\n\n=\" commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n= refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month.

Counts\nFive and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.l\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Is Irrelevant to This Case\n\nThe defendant seeks to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (the “USAO-SDFL”). (Def. Mot. l). She does so despite the fact that: (l) she did not\nnegotiate the NPA, was not a party to the NPA, and her name is not contained anywhere in the\ndocument; and (2) her crimes are not identified or named in any way in the NPA. Essentially, the\ndefendant claims she is immune from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period,\nanywhere, in the United States, based on the language of a document that does not name her and\nwhich she did not sign. Moreover, she seeks to enforce the NPA against a U.S. Atorney’s Office\nthat did not negotiate the NPA and is not bound by it.\n\nThe defendant’s arguments are meritless, and the Court should reject them. As a threshold\nmater, under the well-setled law of this Circuit, the NPA is not enforceable in this District,\nbecause the USAO-SDFL’s agreement with Jeffrey Epstein is not binding on the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York (the “USAO-SDNY”). Moreover, even if the NPA\napplied to this District—which it does not—the NPA does not immunize the defendant from\nprosecution for the crimes charged in the Indictment. Finally, because the defendant has failed to\n' As the Government has repeatedly indicated, the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s co-\nconspirators remains ongoing. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated Aug. 2l, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 46; Gov’t\nLeter dated Oct. 6, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 6o; Gov’t Leter dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65). To the\nextent that investigation results in additional charges against the defendant, the Government\nintends to seek any superseding indictment at least three months in advance of trial. The\nGovernment does not anticipate that any new charges would require the production of any\nadditional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 239\noffer any evidence to support her claim that the NPA applies to this District, to the defendant, or\nto the crimes in the Indictment, the Court should deny the defendant’s request for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\nan evidentiary hearing.\n\nA. The NPA Does Not Bind the Southern District of New York\n\nAs an initial mater, the NPA is not enforceable in this District. To the contrary, it is black-\nleter law in this Circuit that a plea agreement in one district does not apply elsewhere, in the\nabsence of express indications not present here. Indeed, the Second Circuit has considered and\nrejected the exact arguments the defendant advances in her motion. The defendant’s motion is\nwithout any basis in the law and should be denied.\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A\nplea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea\nis entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”’));\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998). This Circuit “presumes a narrou\nreading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a\nmore expansive interpretation was contemplated.” United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l, 854\n(E.D.N.Y. l988) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672), aff'd, 867 F.2d l425 (2d Cir. l988)(tbl.). To\nmeet this burden, a defendant must establish that either the text of the agreement or the\n“negotiations between defendant and prosecutor” indicate a promise to bind other districts. United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant\nhas failed to establish that the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the NPA would bind other\ndistricts.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 239\nOPR Report at l67.'° After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the negotiation, OPR\nconcluded that “the evidence does not shou that [Former USAO-SDFL U.S. Atorney Alex]\nAcosta, [Former USAO-SDFL supervisor Andrew] Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the\nnonprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.” OPR Report at l68.\"\n\nIn view of OPR’s conclusions—and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary\nproffered by the defendant—the defendant has failed to establish that that she was an intended\nthird party beneficiary of the NPA. Accordingly, the defendant lacks standing to enforce the NPA.\n\nC. The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> or a Hearing\n\nThe defendant’s motion for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and a hearing fares no beter. Lacking any\nevidence—much less any legal authority—that the NPA applies to this District or the crimes in\nthe Indictment, the defendant asks the Court to order <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and conduct a hearing. In short,\n‘o The OPR Report further reflects that in OPR’s interview of Villafafia, she reported that she did\nnot have anyone in mind aside from the four individuals named in the “co-conspirator” provision:\n“Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to include a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-\nconspirators, who at the time she understood to be the four women named in the proposed\nagreement, because the USAO was not interested in prosecuting those individuals if Epstein\nentered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, ‘[W]e considered Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and\nwe wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the possibility\nthat Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and no one, including the FBI\ncase agents, raised that concern.” OPR Report at 7o. Further, the OPR Report notes that:\n“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had not\ndeveloped evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’” Jd. at 8l. Similarly, the report\nreflects that a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told OPR “that it never occurred to him that the reference\nto potential co-conspirators was directed touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at\nthe time or subsequently linked with Epstein.” OPR Report at 8o-8l.\n\n'! Although the defendant correctly notes that the OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked\nthat Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened,”\nOPR Report at l67, that desire explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does\nnot inform its meaning or scope.\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 239\nclaiming that the USAO-SDFL made promises that were not contained in the NPA. Nor has she\npointed to anything in the extensive record of either the OPR investigation or the civil litigation\nsurrounding the NPA that would suggest that the NPA applies to this District, or to the crimes in\nthe Indictment, or to Maxwell. In the absence of any such evidence—and in the face of substantial\ncontrary evidence gathered in the civil litigation and OPR investigation—the Court has no\nobligation to conduct a hearing.\n\nFor similar reasons, the defendant’s motion for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> should be denied. To the extent\nthe defendant seeks <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> under Rule l6, she has failed to meet her burden. A defendant\nseeking <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> under Rule l6 “must make a prima facie shouing of materiality and must offer\nmore than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.” United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 26l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (citations omited). Here, the defendant has\noffered nothing more than her conjecture that some unspecified evidence might exist. The motion\nshould be denied.\n\nI. The Indictment Is Timely\n\nCounts One through Four are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse...\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and each of the victims identified in the\nIndictment remains alive. Maxwell contends that Section 3283 should not be applied to conduct\nthat predated its amendment in 2oo3 (Def. Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the\nstatute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other\ncircuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break\nnew ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003011.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 239\n\nto the extent the passage of time affects the memories of witnesses who testify at trial, the\ndefendant will have an opportunity to cross-examine such witnesses. See United States v.\nHarrison, 764 F. Supp. 29, 32 (S.D.N.Y. l99l) (noting that “the passage of time does affect\nwitnesses’ memories and it may be relevant to the credibility of their testimony” and that the\nGovernment also faces potential harms from the passage of time).'® Accordingly, the defendant’s\nbald assertions regarding diminished memories of potential witnesses are speculative and, thus,\nfall short of the proof of actual prejudice required by the Supreme Court’s standard in Marion.\n\nThe defendant also claims that because of the delay in the prosecution, she does not have\naccess to certain exculpatory documentary evidence. (Def. Mot. 7 at l2-l4). Once again, this\nargument is entirely speculative. The defendant hypothesizes that if she had access to certain\ndocumentary evidence (some of which, such as travel records, has been produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>),\nor evidence which she herself should have access to (e.g., her oun emails from l994 to l997, her\noun phone records from l994 to l997, and her oun travel records from l994 to l997), this\nevidence would have helped her. She offers no proof or basis for concluding that the records\nwould be helpful. Even if such records were helpful, dismissal of the Indictment would be too\nextreme a measure in light of the relative significance of this form of evidence to other proof in\nthe case. Thus, the defendant’s claim that she no longer has access to certain evidence is not a\nproper basis to dismiss the Indictment. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l, lo94\n(S.D.N.Y. l973) (“A bare allegation that records have been lost or destroyed, which might relate\n'8 The Government notes that it faces the same potential harms from the passage of time as does\nany party, including loss of witnesses through death or disappearance, diminishment of memories\nover the passage of time, and loss of evidence. The Government, of course, bears the burden of\nproof at trial, and as such, prosecutors have every incentive to bring cases as promptly as possible,\nwhen memories are fresh and when it is possible to identify corroborating witnesses and records.\nAny suggestion that the Government delayed bringing the instant case for over two decades for its\noun benefit or a tactical advantage borders on the absurd.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 239\nto the instant prosecution, is insufficient to shou actual prejudice. .. . The fact that evidence may\nbe lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment stage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the\nduration. Furthermore, there has been no allegation in this case that the destruction of the records\nwas deliberate on the part of either the government or trustee.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nLastly, the defendant contends that prejudicial media reporting and inappropriate pre-trial\npublicity from at least 2oll through the present has resulted in prejudice to the defendant. (Def.\nMot. at l4). She claims that had the Government brought charges against her between l996 and\n2oll, the Government “would have not prevailed,” noting that the defendant’s accusers would not\nhave been “able to conform their ‘memories’ to the often republished ‘obvious lies.’” (/d. at l5).\nThis argument, like the others contained in this motion, is steeped in speculation. The defendant\ncites not one case in support of her argument that pre-trial publicity can ever establish actual\nprejudice, nor does she point to any evidence that the Government fomented such publicity dating\nback to 2oll. To the extent the defendant is concerned about pretrial publicity, she will have the\nopportunity to propose an appropriate examination of potential jurors during voir dire to identify\na panel of impartial jurors who have not been prejudiced by any publicity this case may have\ngarnered.\n\nIn short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,\nspeculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as\ninsufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay.'!? The motion should\ntherefore be denied.\n\n'° The defendant also complains about the Government’s failure to “provide <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> adequate\nto fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 7). Among the\nitems the defense complains about not receiving in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> are the names and dates of birth of\nthe Minor Victims, the specific location of any overt act, the date of any overt act, any witness\nstatements, or any corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment. (/d.). As described herein,\nsee Section X, infra, the Government has made substantial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions pursuant to Rule\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003017.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 83 of 239\nsatisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” (internal quotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nMoreover, even if the Court were to determine that a twenty-six-year period of delay were\napplicable here, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed because she failed to shou that the\nGovernment acted improperly to obtain a tactical advantage. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o (denying motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay as to conduct charged in 2ol6\ninvolving sexual abuse of minors from l998 to 2oo7 as defendant failed to satisfy both prongs of\npre-indictment delay standard); United States v. Burke, No. o9 Cr. l35 (SJ), 2oll WL 26o9837,\nat *7 (E.D.N.Y. July l, 2oll) (denying motion to dismiss indictment based on thirty-year pre-\nindictment delay because even if unavailability of alibi witnesses were prejudicial, defendant failed\nto shou that government delayed for its oun benefit); United States v. Carbonaro, No. o2 Cr. 743\n(RCC), 2oo4 WL 2222l45 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3o, 2oo4) (in a racketeering conspiracy case in which\na l4-year-old murder was alleged as a predicate act, finding that, even assuming defendant had\nshoun actual prejudice, defendant’s motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay failed\nbecause defendant supplied no evidence that government’s conduct was for an improper purpose).\n\nThe defendant claims that the Government intentionally delayed the indictment in this case\nwith a prescient view touards capitalizing on civil litigation. For instance, Maxwell asserts that it\n“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from\nMs. Maxwell as part of civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and disseminating that information to the public, as part of\nan ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l6). She again cites the subpoena\nthe Government issued to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to obtain materials\nfrom the Giuffre civil litigation. (/d.). Leaving aside the fact that, as set forth in Section IV, the\nGovernment obtained such materials through a judicially approved and entirely appropriate\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003018.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 239\nprocess, the inference that the defendant urges this Court to draw—that the Government delayed\nseeking an indictment to gain a tactical advantage and did so through strategy in the pending civil\nlitigation—is both unsupported by the record and illogical.\n\nThe defendant makes much of the Government having moved to intervene and stay the\nproceedings in Doe v. Indyke, No. 2o Civ. 484 (JGK), while the Government has not moved to\nstay Giuffre v. Maxwell. (Def. Mot. 7 at l6-l9). She suggests that there is some “sharp contrast”\nbetween the Government’s actions in the various civil maters, which “establish a strong inference\nthat as long as the government stood to gain a tactical advantage by delaying the indictment. . ., it\nwould not move to intervene.” (/d. at l9). Seting the defendant’s conspiracy theories aside, the\ncivil maters were in completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns\nregarding a pending criminal case. The Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation was setled and complete\nwell before the Government even opened its investigation in this case. By contrast, the Doe v.\nIndyke case was initiated after the Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing\nafter the Indictment in this case was filed.?? The defendant quotes the Government’s leter to Judge\nFreeman requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indyke (see id.), but omits the portion\nof that leter in which the Government explained that, as far as it was aware, Doe v. Indyke was\nthe “lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or stayed at this point... . In\n3 In particular, Giuffre v. Maxwell was resolved in 2ol7 and the determination of what material\nshould remain sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there is no more <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to be\nconducted in the Giuffre case and no possible concern to the Government that, for example, its\ntrial witnesses in the criminal case might be deposed in that civil case. In Doe v. Indyke, on the\nother hand, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> was just beginning, and if <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> were to have proceeded, multiple\nwitnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition.\nThat concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil mater would\nadversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against the defendant. Moreover, the interests\nof judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a\nstay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the\nDoe case. Such concerns are not present in Giuffre v. Maxwell.\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003020.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 239\nmanufactured any alleged delay to gain a tactical advantage over her. She has “offered no credible\nevidence to suggest that the Government tarried in bringing charges against [her] solely to gain\nsome prosecutorial advantage.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5. As such, because the\ndefendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of shouing both actual prejudice and unjustifiable\nGovernment conduct, her motion to dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay should be\ndenied.”\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). (Def. Mots. 3 & ll). In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a protective order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination. Although the defendant styles her request for relief as two separate\n°5 The defendant asks the Court for leave to supplement her motion “after the government provides\nher with meaningful <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>” and notes that “after the disclosure of meaningful <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, [she]\nmay request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not\nbeen dismissed on other grounds.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\ninvitation to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS),\n2olo WL 289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July l3, 2olo) (“The motion to dismiss the Indictment as the\nresult of pre-indictment delay is therefore denied, without prejudice to appropriately supported\nlater motion practice.”); United States v. Drago, No. l8 Cr. o394 (SJF) (AYS), 2ol9 WL 3o72288,\nat *2 (E.D.N.Y. July l5, 2ol9) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay\nwithout prejudice to renewal).\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 87 of 239\nmotions, the suppression motions overlap in fact and argument, and accordingly, the Government\nresponds to both motions in this section.\n\nAs set forth herein, the defendant’s suppression motions challenging a judicially approved\ngrand jury subpoena should be denied without a hearing for multiple reasons. As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 239\n\nEx. 7), but AUSA-l does not recall the details of that conversation (see Ex. 4 at 4), nor is the\nGovernment aware of any notes or other records documenting the substance of the call. The\nGovernment has not identified any records that suggest AUSA-l ever communicated via email\nwith Potinger, Edwards, Skinner, or any other atorney at Boies Schiller regarding this mater after\nMay 3, 2ol6.\n\nThe USAO-SDNY did not open an investigation into Epstein or Maxwell in 2ol6. (d. at\n4).\n\n3. The April and July 2ol6 Depositions of Maxwell\n\nOn March 2, 2ol6, Maxwell moved for entry of a protective order for materials produced\nin <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and submited a proposed order for the consideration of the Honorable Robert W.\nSweet, the United States District Judge who was then overseeing the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil\nlitigation. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. Nos. 38 & 39-l). On or about March 4, 2ol6, Boies\nSchiller represented that Giuffre did not oppose the entry of a protective order, but opposed the\nform proposed by Maxwell out of concern that it was overly broad and could lead to over-\ndesignation of material as confidential. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 4o at 2). Boies Schiller\nsubmited a redline of Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and adding\nlanguage that confidential material could be disclosed to law enforcement. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. B).\nOn March l8, 2ol6, Judge Sweet entered a protective order governing the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ndissemination of confidential information after the parties agreed to the form of the order originally\nproposed by Maxwell. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 62; see also Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 2-3).\n\n64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003026.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 92 of 239\nThe protective order, among other things, restricted the parties from disclosing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\nmarked confidential to third parties, absent express permission from the Court.\n\nIn connection with the defamation suit, Maxwell was deposed by Boies Schiller, counsel\nfor Giuffre, on April 22, 2ol6 and July 22, 2ol6.\n\nOn or about May 24, 2ol7, the parties entered into a setlement agreement and voluntarily\ndismissed the civil action. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 9l6). Boies Schiller has continued\nto represent Giuffre in post-setlement litigation. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir.);\nGiuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.).\n\n4. The USAO-SDNY Commences the Instant Investigation in 2ol8\n\nOn or about November 29, 2ol8, the USAO-SDNY initiated its investigation into Epstein\nand possible co-conspirators, and formally opened the investigation by completing the requisite\npaperwork to open an investigation on or about November 3o, 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction. See Julie K. Broun, “Even\nfrom Jail, Sex Abuser Manipulated the System. His Victims Were Kept in the Dark,” Miami\nHerald (Nov. 28, 2ol8).*!_AUSA-l was not involved in the decision to open the investigation or\nin the investigation itself. (See Ex. 4 at 6). Indeed, AUSA-l stopped serving as the Office’s\nHuman Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator as of April 2ol7.\n\nShortly after initiating the investigation, the prosecutors involved in the investigation\nlearned of the prior February 2ol6 meeting and requested copies of AUSA-l’s notes and records\n3l Indeed, on July 8, 2ol9, at the press conference follouing the arrest of Epstein, Geoffrey S.\nBerman, then United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York, stated that while he\nwas not “going to go into any aspects of hou our investigation originated[,] I will say that we were\nassisted from some excellent investigative journalism.”\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003027.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 239\nfrom that meeting. On or about December 6, 2ol8, AUSA-l provided the prosecutors with her\nnotes from the February 2ol6 meeting (which are atached as Exhibit 5) and documents the\natorneys provided.*?\n\nSs The USAO-SDNY’s Subpoenas and Ex Parte Applications for\nMaterials\n\nShortly after opening the investigation in late November 2ol8, the Government identified\npossible victims and their counsel through public filings or media reports, which included Boies\nSchiller. (Def. Mem. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). The USAO-SDNY first contacted Boies Schiller about its\ninvestigation on or about December l8, 2ol8. Shortly thereafter, in or about December or January\n2ol8, the Government indicated to Boies Schiller that it intended to make document requests.\nBoies Schiller generally advised the Government that a protective order would govern some of the\nmaterials. (/d. at 3).\n\nIn or about February 2ol9, approximately two months after the USAO-SDNY opened its\ninvestigation (and almost three years after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting described above), the\nUSAO-SDNY issued two criminal grand jury subpoenas to Boies Schiller. One of the subpoenas\nrequested non-privileged documents relating to Giuffre v. Maxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (RWS); the other\n>? The Government has reviewed the file that AUSA-l provided to the prosecution team on or\nabout December 6, 2ol8 and understands, based on a review of that file, that at the February 2ol6\nmeeting, AUSA-l received copies of Epstein’s black book, flight records, and Palm Beach Police\nDepartment reports. Although AUSA-l does not nou recall the atorneys providing her with any\ndocuments at the meeting (Ex. 4 at 2), an email she sent to the prosecution team on December 6,\n2ol8 refers to these documents as materials that the atorneys provided at the meeting.\n\nThe Government notes that as of March 7, 2ol6, one week after AUSA-l’s February 29,\n2ol6 meeting with the atorneys when she received these documents, Maxwell had only produced\ntwo emails in response to Giuffre’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at\nl-2). None of the documents apparently provided to AUSA-l during the February 2ol6 meeting\nwas an email. Accordingly, the Government has no reason to believe that Giuffre’s counsel\nprovided AUSA-l with any <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case. AUSA-l\nalso does not believe she ever received any such <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials.

(/d.). The court also\nstated that such formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason was\nprovided. (/d.). In its leters, the Government noted that its “specific knouledge of the subject\nmater of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential nature” of the litigation.\n(/d. at 2 n.l). The Government also submited that the court need not employ the Martindell\nbalancing test to evaluate the Government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a\nprotective order because (l) the Martindell balancing test generally relates to “instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without [ ] grand jury process” and (2) “any\npresumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where, as here, the\nprotective order is on its face temporary or limited.” (/d. at 3-4).\n\n6. Proceedings before Chief Judge McMahon\na. March 26, 2ol9 Hearing\nJudge Sweet passed away in March 2ol9 before ruling on the Government’s application.\nAfter Judge Sweet’s death, but before the civil case was reassigned to a new judge, Chief Judge\nMcMahon took up the Government’s application. Chief Judge McMahon subsequently inquired\nabout the Government’s application in two transcribed ex parte and sealed hearings. (Def. Mot.\n3, Exs. D & E). At the first hearing, on March 26, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon inquired as to\nwhy Boies Schiller did not make an application for permission to be relieved from the protective\norder, to which the Government replied that it could not “speak to why Boies Schiller in particular\ndidn’t make their oun application.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 3). The Government further noted that\nBoies Schiller “simply isn’t in a position to be able to describe the investigation in the way that\nwe have in our submission.” (/d. at ll-l2). Chief Judge McMahon noted that she believed that\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003031.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 239\nof the materials in light of the “extraordinary protections” of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedue\n6(e). Ud. at l7-l8).\n\nFinally, Chief Judge McMahon also inquired whether the materials sought by the\nGovernment might be used to commence criminal proceedings against either of the parties to the\nlibel case, i.e., including Maxwell. (/d. at l8). The Government acknouledged that possibility as\na general mater. (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon noted that the parties to the protective order relied\non that order “in order to give whatever in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> they gave, whether it was deposition\ntestimony they gave or — then again, I can’t fathom why anybody who has any criminal exposure\nwould not have taken the Fifth Amendment in response to questions in a civil deposition, but I\ndon’t knou.” (/d. at l8-l9). The Government stated, “I do not knou, but I think it is entirely\npossible that what we are seeking is page after page of people taking the Fifth. That is entirely\npossible. But to the extent that it is not or there are other materials -- and this may be bad for our\nargument, but in all transparency and candor, I think there may be other individuals who also relied\non the protective order.” (/d.). The Government further explained that it “want[ed] to have a\nformal application” for the relevant materials and took that approach to “avoid the types of\nproblems” created by other less formal government requests in other cited cases. (/d. at 2o).\n\nb. April 9, 2ol9 Hearing\n\nChief Judge McMahon held another conference on April 9, 2ol9. She stated that she\nwanted “to make sure I’m not in a Chemical Bank kind of situation, so I would like to knou about\ncontacts between [the USAO-SDNY and Boies Schiller] prior to the issuance of the subpoena on\nthe subject of your investigation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added)).*4 In Chemical\n4 Tellingly, Maxwell omits the italicized portion of this question from her motion, thereby\nstripping important context from the nature of Chief Judge McMahon’s question which, as asked,\nwas focused on “your investigation.” (See Def.

But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller.

(quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 239\n\nThe defendant asks the Court for a drastic remedy, namely suppression of a// evidence the\nGovernment obtained pursuant to the subpoena, as well as the dismissal of Counts Five and Six.\nIn so doing, the defendant seeks a windfall to which she is not entitled based on unprecedented\nclaims that ignore the facts and the law. Suppression of all materials the Government obtained\npursuant to the subpoena is unwarranted here, particularly where certain of the materials have been\nsubsequently unsealed by Judge Preska in the underlying civil litigation, including Maxwell’s\nApril 2ol6 deposition transcript. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). The Second Circuit\naffirmed Judge Preska’s ruling in October 2o2o, finding that the Court “correctly held that the\ndeposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access ataches,\nand did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests\nsuperseded the presumption of access.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-\nl at 3).” On October 22, 2o2o, the defendant’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5\nCiv. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3). In February 2o2l, a redacted version of the defendant’s July\n2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l). In other words,\nhad the Government not obtained an order modifying the protective order, the Government\ninevitably would have discovered and obtained, at a minimum, the defendant’s April 2ol6\ndeposition transcript and a portion of the July 2ol6 transcript that form the basis of the charges in\nCounts Five and Six.\n* Relatedly, the defendant moved to modify the criminal protective order in order to use\nconfidential criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in filings she intended to submit in civil litigation. The\ndefendant raised this precise point—that if the Court ultimately decided that it was inappropriate\nfor the Government to proceed by subpoena, the Government would claim inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n(Dkt. No. 54 at 3). The defendant offered no coherent explanation of hou the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no\ncase law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument by the\nGovernment should foreclose unsealing in a civil case. This Court rejected the defendant’s motion\nto modify the criminal protective order. (Dkt. No. 5l). The Second Circuit also dismissed the\ndefendant’s appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 7l).\n\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 239\nGovernment has responded with reliable information directly rebuting the defendant’s allegations,\nthere is no material issue of fact sufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.**\n\nThe defendant cites Franks, to suggest that a hearing is somehou warranted, but her motion\nfalls far short of the standard required to obtain a hearing. “While the Franks analysis discussed\nabove is typically employed to evaluate misstatements and omissions relating to probable cause,\nthe Second Circuit has extended the Franks analysis to other Title III requirements for obtaining a\nwarrant.” United States v. Rajaratnam, No. o9 Cr. ll84 (RJH), 2olo WL 48674o2, at *l8\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2olo). The defendant fails to identify the standard that would govern such a\nhearing. In light of the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap, the USAO-SDNY submits that\nthe defendant’s depositions in a civil mater, even with a protective order, are no more significant\nthan the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap. As such, the exacting standard of Franks should\napply. On this record, the defendant has not made a threshold shouing that the Government acted\nwith the intent to mislead or in reckless disregard for the truth. The Franks standard is rightly a\n“high one,” Rivera, 928 F.2d at 6o4, and one the defendant has failed to meet here.\n\nThe defendant’s bald assertions alone do not entitle her to a fishing expedition in the form\nof a hearing.\n\nV. The Jury Should Decide Whether the Defendant Commited Perjury\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that, during the course of two depositions, the\ndefendant knouingly made false material declarations, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.

Supp. 2d at 26l (citations omited). Because the defendant has offered\nnothing more than her conjecture, based on an inaccurate and hearsay-ridden article, that some\nunspecified evidence might exist, her request for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> should be denied.\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 239\nGou stated that Giuffre’s claims were “untrue” and “obvious lies.” (l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.\nNo. | at 6).\n\nAs described in the preceding section, in the fall of 2ol5, Giuffre sued the defendant for\ndefamation.*° (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l). Giuffre alleged that Epstein sexually abused\nher, “with the assistance and participation of Maxwell” at “numerous locations” between l999 and\n2oo2, and that Epstein abused more than thirty minors between 2ool and 2oo7 “with the assistance\nof numerous co-conspirators.” (/d. at 3).\n\nDuring the defendant’s first deposition on April 22, 2ol6, the defendant refused to answer\nquestions that she deemed related to consensual adult sexual interactions. (See, e.g., Ex. lo at\n92:2o-93:6). Giuffre moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual situation with the\noffer of a job making money as a massage therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l at 5-\n6). Giuffre also explained that the defendant’s refusal to answer questions about adult consensual\nsex prevented Giuffre “from seeking legitimate <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,” such as the identity of people the\ndefendant presently deemed adults. (/d. at 6).\n\nThe Court granted Giuffre’s motion. “[N]otwithstanding” the intrusiveness of the\nquestions and the fact that the defendant had not put her private affairs at issue, “the questions are\ndirected to reveal relevant answers regarding Defendant’s knouledge of Plaintiff’s allegations.”\n© The belou discussion is provided as context for the Court’s consideration of the motion. As\ndiscussed further in the Government’s opposition to the defendant’s motion for severance, the\nGovernment expects to provide a more streamlined presentation regarding the Giuffre suit at trial.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 239\n\nFinally, even if a defendant makes a knouing false statement, a perjury conviction requires\nthat the statement be material. A false statement is material if it has “a natural tendency to\ninfluence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was\naddressed.” United States v. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (quotation\nmarks omited). A statement made in a civil deposition is also material if “a truthful answer might\nreasonably be calculated to lead to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of evidence admissible at the trial of the\nunderlying suit.” United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994)); see United States v.\nBirrell, 47o F.2d ll3, ll5 n.l (2d Cir. l972) (explaining, in the context of a motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis and for appointment of counsel, that “it must be shoun that a truthful answer would\nhave been of sufficient probative importance to the inquiry so that, as a minimum, further fruitful\ninvestigation would have occurred.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). “The\ntestimony need not have actually influenced, misled, or impeded the proceeding.” United States\nv. Chan Lo, No. l4 Cr. 49l (VSB), 2ol6 WL 9o76234, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2ol6), aff'd 679 F.\nApp’x 79 (2d Cir. 2ol7); see Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d at 4l2. Since materiality is an element of the\noffense, it is a question for the jury “except in the most extraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o\nF. Supp. 2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects to prove at trial that the defendant’s deposition statements were\nknouingly false. The defendant’s strained efforts to inject ambiguity into the questioning and to\njustify her answers as truthful are in significant part, arguments that are properly put to the jury\nand not a basis to dismiss the counts pretrial and without the benefit of a complete record. See\nUnited States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 237 F. App’x 625, 627-28 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“Generally, the meaning and truthfulness of a defendant’s statement is a question of fact for the\n\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003096.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 239\n\nThe defendant is, of course, free to testify on her oun behalf to her professed confusion or\notherwise argue to the jury that the questions were ambiguous or the answers truthful. The issue\nbefore the Court is whether the questions were so fundamentally ambiguous that a jury, after\nhearing the trial evidence, could not conclude that the “response given was false as the defendant\nunderstood the question.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). The\ndefendant has failed to establish such a fundamental defect.”\n\n3. Materiality\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that none of these answers was material to the defamation\naction. Asa threshold issue, houever, materiality is also not appropriate for resolution on a motion\nto dismiss the indictment. As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury conviction, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“It is customary, and ordinarily not\nimproper, to include more than one allegedly false statement in a single count. ... Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\nsufficient to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 239\nchoices reflected in the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> rules.” Jd. Second, doing so “risks invading ‘the\ninviolable function of the jury’ in our criminal justice system.’” /d. at 28l (citation omited).\nAccordingly, if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined with a\ndefendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” Jd.\n\nThe exception to this rule is “extraordinarily narrou” because, in the normal course, the\n“government must make a detailed presentation of the entirety of the evidence before a district\ncourt can dismiss an indictment on sufficiency grounds,” which the Government is not required to\ndo at the motion-to-dismiss stage. /d. at 282 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). That\npoint is underscored by United States v. Nitsche, 843 F. Supp. 2d 4 (D.D.C. 2oll), on which the\ndefendant relies. There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a child enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence. First, houever, the court explained that the question was ripe\nbecause “(l) Defendant has stipulated to the entire record that is relevant to Count I; (2) the\nGovernment has had several opportunities to make a proffer of any additional facts, to conduct\nany subsequent investigation, and to ask the Court for further delay to seek more evidence; and (3)\nbecause the record is limited to the chat.” Jd. at 9. Accordingly, “[t]he transcripts themselves\nprovide the Court with all of the relevant undisputed facts to decide the motion.” /d. Here, of\ncourse, that is simply not the case and, in particular, there is no stipulation as to the entire relevant\nrecord.\n\nUnder the relevant legal standard, the defendant’s statements were material if they could\nhave led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of other evidence or could influence the factfinder in the defendant’s\ncivil case. Evaluating that standard necessarily implicates facts beyond the deposition testimony\nitself and Judge Preska’s unsealing order,*’ such as identification of the allegedly defamatory\n°° The defendant observes that Judge Preska redacted some of the statements that form the basis\nof Count Six, stating that the “testimony is . . . far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 239\n\nas to those counts, and would consent to a similar limiting instruction, which a jury would be\npresumed to follou. And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the\ndefendant would surely argue that a limiting instruction is necessary to prevent the jury from\nconcluding that the defendant’s statements were false based in part on the substance of Giuffre’s\nunproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for that\npurpose, so can the jury set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for Counts One through\nFour.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a “collateral trial” on the\ntruth of Giuffre’s statements and resolution of “more than 5o substantive motions . . . pending\nbefore the District Court.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-lo). As described in Section V, a false statement in\na civil deposition is material (l) if a “truthful answer might reasonably be calculated to lead to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit,” United States v. Kross, l4\nF.3d 75l, 753 (2d Cir. l994), or (2) if it has “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,” United States v.\nGaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omited).\nNeither of these standards requires the jury to determine whether the defendant’s statements would\nhave tipped the scales in the defamation suit or would likely have led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of evidence.\nSee Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 77l (l988) (“It has never been the test of materiality\nthat the misrepresentation or concealment would more likely than not have produced an erroneous\ndecision, or even that it would more likely than not have triggered an investigation.”); United States\nv. An Antique Plater of Gold, l84 F.3d l3l, l35-36 (2d Cir. l999) (distinguishing the “natural\ntendency test” from a but-for test); Kross, l4 F.3d at 754 (rejecting, in a civil forfeiture case, the\nargument that the defendant’s true testimony would not itself have justified a forfeiture because\n\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 239\n“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”). The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not identified what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y.

The Indictment Contains the Elements of Each Offense and Provides the Defendant\n\nMore Than Adequate Notice of the Charges Against Her\n\nThe defendant also moves to dismiss Counts One through Four on the grounds that the\nIndictment lacks specificity because it does not name minor victims, does not include specific\ndates, and uses language that the defendant claims not to understand.

Applicable Law\n\nIt is well-established that “[a]n indictment is sufficient if it contains the elements of the\noffense(s) charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge(s) against which he must\ndefend.” United States v. Rahimi, No. l6 Cr. 76o (RMB), 2ol7 WL 2984l69, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 22, 2ol7) (citing United States v. Chalmers, 474 F. Supp. 2d 555, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7);\nHamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). As a result, “‘an indictment need do litle\nmore than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate\nterms) of the alleged crime’” in order to be sufficient. United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686,\n693 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting United States v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d Cir. l975)). As\nsuch, “[a] defendant faces a high standard in seeking to dismiss an indictment.” United States v.\nNejad, No. l8 Cr. 224 (AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2ol9) (internal quotation\nmarks omited) (quoting United States v. Post, 95o F. Supp. 2d 5l9, 527 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3)).\nAdditionally, “when deciding a motion to dismiss, a court must accept all factual allegations in the\nindictment as true.” Chalmers, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 559. “A court should not look beyond the face\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 239\n\nis particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d\nl294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)); United States v.

Houever, the\nGovernment has provided such information, and much more, in the Indictment, extensive\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and various pretrial filings, including this memorandum. The defendant will also\nreceive trial exhibits, a witness list, and Jencks Act material reasonably in advance of trial.

Plainly it is not. In\naddition to the speaking Indictment, the defendant has received over 2.7 million pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nin this case. Although that is a high volume of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, it is clear from the defense’s oun motion\nthat the defense has apparently already reviewed that material (at least in significant part),\nidentified relevant materials therein, and is aware of their relevance to the allegations in the\nIndictment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. lo at 6).

Accordingly, the Government has no records of commercial flights that\nthe defendant, Epstein, or any victims may have taken during the relevant period.\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 239\neC\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee and the Government has provided the defense with the\nbirth month and year of each minor victim.”\n\nIn other words, as the Government has previously indicated, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about the three minor victims to permit her to\nprepare for trial. The <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> also provides the defense the ability to identify specific private\nplane flights that are relevant to the Indictment. Any remaining detail regarding the specifics of\nabuse, particular interactions, and additional trips will come from witness testimony. As is to be\nexpected when describing events more than two decades in the past, that testimony will provide\napproximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates. Given the information\nthe defendant already has from the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Indictment, and the Government’s court filings\n(including this memorandum), any additional detail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act\nproduction, allouing the defendant to tailor any testimony to the Government’s case.

In this memorandum, the Government has\nsummarized hou the defendant’s false statements during her deposition were material to the\npending civil litigation. See Section V, supra. Perhaps more importantly, the defendant personally\nparticipated in that civil litigation, and she is undoubtedly quite familiar with it.\n\nTogether, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions, briefing in which the Government has described\naspects of its evidence and theory (see, e.g., Government Memorandum in Opposition to Renewed\nBail Motion, Dec. l8, 2o2o, Dkt. No. loo, at 8-l2), the contents of this memorandum, and the\ndetails contained in the Indictment more than adequately inform the defendant of the charges\nagainst her. This is simply not a case where the “relevance of key events [are] shrouded in\nmystery.” See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574. Accordingly, the Court should deny the motion for a\nbill of particulars.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Requests for Early Production of a Witness List and Jencks\n\nAct Material Should Be Denied\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 “does not require the Government to furnish the\nnames and addresses of its witnesses in general.” United States v. Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39 (2d\n63 Although the victims’ identities are clear from the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and the defendant’s motion makes\nclear that she strongly suspects their identities, there is no basis to require the Government to turn\nover the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in advance of its Jencks Act\nproduction, which is customary in this District. See Section X.B., infra.\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 239\nCir. l99o). Thus, “‘[iJn the absence of a specific shouing that disclosure [of a witness list] [is]\nboth material to the preparation of [the] defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances\nsurrounding [the] case,’ the request for a witness list should be denied.” United States v. Russo,\n483 F. Supp. 2d 3ol, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (quoting Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d at l39-4o). “Courts in the\nSecond Circuit typically deny motions for the early disclosure of witness lists where, as here,\nDefendants have not made a specific shouing of need.” United States v. Rivera, No. l6 Cr. l75\n(LGS), 2ol7 WL l8433o2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol7). The claim that “given the complexity\nof the case, disclosure of the government witness list will level the playing field” amounts to an\n“abstract statement of need” that does not justify provision of a witness list. Russo, 483 F. Supp.\n2d at 3o9.\n\nThe Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo, covers disclosure of statements or reports made by\nGovernment witnesses, and the rule mandates that such materials not be the subject of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nor inspection “until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.” l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo(a); see also United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he Jencks\nAct prohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.”); United\nStates v.

These representations are sufficient.”’).\n\nDe Discussion\n\nTrial is still more than four months away. The degree of complexity to this case, and the\nvolume of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, is on par with other recent high-profile trials in this District, and in those\ncases witnesses have typically been disclosed approximately three to four weeks before trial. E.g.,\nGato, l7 Cr. 686 (LAK); Blaszezak, l7 Cr. 357 (LAK); Skelos, l5 Cr. 3l7 (KMW)); Silver, l5 Cr.\n93 (VEC); Ulbricht, l4 Cr. 68 (KBF). As the Government has noted for some time nou, the\nGovernment intends to match or even go above and beyond that practice in this case. Specifically,\nthe Government has offered repeatedly to provide non-testifying witness statements to the defense\nas much as eight weeks before trial, thereby allouing extra time for the defense to determine\nwhether it wishes to call any of the witnesses the Government does not intend to present at trial,\nand to provide testifying witness statements and Giglio material as much as four weeks in advance\nof trial. Given that the defense has already been able to initiate its investigation of the charges,\nand given that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> makes clear who the three minor victims are, eight weeks should be\nample time to review non-testifying witness statements, and four weeks is more than enough time\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 239\n\nto review the statements of testifying witnesses. The Government remains open to engaging in\ngood faith discussions with the defense to mutually agree on a schedule for reciprocal pretrial\ndisclosures.“ Accordingly, the motion for a witness list and early production of Jencks Act\nmaterial should be denied.\n\nc.

The Government\nrespectfully submits that is sufficient to meet its obligations with respect to these documents, and\nthe defendant’s motion for their immediate disclosure should be denied.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s request for an unredacted copy of the FBI report atached to the\nDefense Motion as Exhibit C should be denied as moot because the Government has already\nproduced an unredacted copy of that report to the defense. (Def. Mot. lo at 8-9). Specifically, the\ndocument was produced without redactions under bates numbers SDNY _GM_ oo38o55o through\nSDNY_GM_oo38o554 as part of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production dated November 9,\n2o2o.° This motion should accordingly be denied as moot.\n\nThird, the defendant’s request for unredacted copies of the FBI report regarding ||\nee is based purely on her speculation that the redacted portions\nof those materials contain exculpatory information. (Def. Mot. lo at 8-9). Once again, the\na. Out of an abundance of caution, today the Government has informed defense counsel\nOrn cr\n6° Notably, the unredacted report does not contain ed\na demonstrating that defense counsel’s speculation about\nsupposed Brady material lurking beneath redactions is inaccurate. The redacted copy defense\ncounsel atached as Exhibit C was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for one of\nEpstein’s devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was recovered from\nthe device. In other words, defense counsel has received two copies of this same document: the\nredacted version that Epstein had on one of his devices, and the unredacted version from the FBI’s\nfiles.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 239\nEpstein or the defendant.”)). In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory\nevidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this\nrepresentation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be\ndenied.\n\nFifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the\nGovernment to produce copies of a// subpoenas it has issued for the defendant’s records as part of\nits investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. lo at ll). This incredibly broad request is nothing more\nthan a fishing expedition inappropriately seeking the details of investigative requests made through\nthe grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government\nto provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other\nmaterials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the\ndefendant’s records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of\nrequests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the\ndefense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable\nmaterial that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In\nthe absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the\nreasons discussed above in Sections I and I'V, the defendant is not entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or a hearing\nrelating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress\nsubpoena returns.\n\nSixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any\nBrady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. lo at ll-l3). The motion for disclosure of Brady material\nshould be denied as moot because the Government has conducted a search for any such material\nand has already disclosed any potentially exculpatory information in its possession of which it is\n\nl88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 239\naware, consistent with the Rule 5(f) Brady order previously issued by the Court in this case. See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its possession regarding any potential witness identified during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its possession for\npotential impeachment material. The Government remains cognizant of its Brady obligations and\nwill promptly produce any potentially exculpatory material if any is identified during that review.\n\nThe Government is not currently aware of any undisclosed Brady material in its possession,\nbut it will certainly provide timely disclosure of any additional Brady material if any such material\ncomes to light. Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations under Brady.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of 348\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriffs work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

Ghislaine Maxwell, et al.\n(“Guiffre’), l5 Civ. 7433 (RWS) (the “Litigation”), a copy of which is enclosed as Exhibit A.\n\nBackground\n\nAs described in the Application, the Government has served a grand jury subpoena\n(the *Subpoena’’) upon Boies Schiller & Flexner (“Boies Schiller’) requiring the production of\ncopies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and related materials related to the Litigation. The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”). The production of materials\npursuant to the Subpoena is solely for the purposes of the Investigation, and is subject to the\nprotections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim.

Houever, the Government is advised that\nalthough Boies Schiller would not otherwise contest compliance with the Subpoena, it believes\nthat a protective order entered in the Litigation (the “Protective Order”) may preclude compliance.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requested that the Court issue an order\npermiting Boies Schiller to comply with the validly-issued Subpoena.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL —\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable protective order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case. As described belou, a court can and should\nmodify a protective order, or permit limited relief from it, to allou the recipient of a grand jury\nsubpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.\nThe Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins.

As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed.

The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun.

It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot.

Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot.

The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses.

For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\n6 Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\n® Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> schedule.\n\n® Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the Sl superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3676\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8of34\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003694.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 34\nto describe the windou of when a violation occurred.” United States v.

Sept. 4, 2oo8) (collecting\ncases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time,\nand witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when\nabuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct.\n\nMaxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges\nimpermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the\nindictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of\nthe crime. 7ramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The language of the Sl superseding indictment does so.\nThe Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is\nnot inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the\ncharges.\n\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not\nprovide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged\nvictims’ names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally\nneed not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United\nStates v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l27 (2d Cir. 2ol3); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364,\n369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).

Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3696\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\nreasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the ‘inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately\npresented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 34\n(PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting cases). The Court therefore\ndenies Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\n\nVIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures\n\nMaxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it\nhas in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the\nGovernment’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator\nstatements, and Rule 4o4(b) material. Based on the Government’s response in briefing and\nleters the parties have since submited to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have\nbeen overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not\nentitled to expedite this <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will\nrequire the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all\n\nBrady and Giglio Material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v.\nUnited States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain\nevidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under\nGiglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also\ninformation that could be used to impeach a key government witness.” United States v. Coppa,\n267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). As a general rule, “Brady and\nits progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material\nupon request by a defendant.” J/d. at l46. “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in\ntime for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law\nsimply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.” /d. at l44.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003705.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require resolution\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above\nmaterials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9ofl6\n\nThe defamation litigation was legally very complicated and New York law afforded\nmany statutory, common law, and constitutional defenses to Ms. Maxwell (which may become\nrelevant at another time). In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions. Significantly, Judge Sweet’s Order prefaced all the listed categories with\nthe words “sexual activity” an “sexual activities.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003733.jpg": "CascGAS8-4:29595oo83o-PAR umbocement 2o84 on FilechO4L62 54/o7 age 9 Of Ade 3 of lo\n\nJane Doe 4’s claims would be “duplicative”); DE 298 at l n.l (“As promised . . .

The Government has raised various relevancy objections\nto the documents that Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 are atempting to obtain. The current\nvictims have responded by explaining hou these documents are relevant, including explaining\nhou these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his pouerful political and\nsocial connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s\nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to\nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knouledge. See, e.g.,\n\nDE 266 at 6-lo. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of\nthese requests, as well as the need for those requests.\n\nOne clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding\nEpstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea\narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince\nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz. Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,\n\ne.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at l6-l8). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knouledge of\nEpstein’s connection with some of these pouerful! people and thus hou Epstein might have used\nthem to secure favorable treatment.\n\nAdding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings.

Counsel for the victims have\ndiscussed this motion with the Government at length in an effort to avoid any need to file a\nsubstantive pleading on the issue. Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the\nsummer for its position on joinder. The Government, houever, took the mater under\nadvisement for months.

Indeed,\nmany of the arguments made by the government in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions reveal\nnew information that undercut its claims about the origins of, and motives behind, this\nprosecution.\n\nMs. Maxwell raised this issue pretrial, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P l2(b)(3)(A)(i). In\nher opening memorandum Ms. Maxwell noted that significant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> related to the\nallegations had not yet been provided by the government, that her investigation is ongoing, and\nrequested that the Court defer ruling on this motion.\n\nThe government’s responses to Ms. Maxwell’s motions, including its response to this\nmotion, underscore the legitimacy of Ms. Maxwell’s continued request that the Court hold this\nissue open. As reflected in the various pleadings, the government did have communications with\nlawyers for civil litigants and did have information about the allegations made in the indictment\nwell before it claims the investigation was opened. Ms. Maxwell learned about these things only\nbecause the government felt the need to make partial disclosures in an atempt to defend its\nactions.\n\nIn its response to the instant motion, the government, without actually disclosing the\nwitness’s statements, selectively “proffers” “facts” to justify its position but tells Ms. Maxwell\nand the Court that we should, apparently, just trust the government because “the underlying\ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 3o2 reports of interviews with the victims, will be\nproduced to the defense as 35oo material in advance of trial.” Resp. at 55 fn. 2l.\n\nAs discussed in her Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Specificity, for a Bill of Particulars,\nand for Pretrial Disclosures, the government’s failure to provide adequate information about the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of5\nallegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s ability to investigate and\ndefend this mater. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v.

Leon,\n\nSuppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing\n\na warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false\n\nor would have knoun was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.\n\n468 U.S. 897, 923 (l984).\n\nHere, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support\nthereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order\nand authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (reversing\ndistrict court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ndoctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagell of 2o\n\nSecond, the government’s inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine is far too speculative. The\n“typical application” of the inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine is when “the government seeks to\ninvoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring\ninventory searches.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government’s “inevitability analysis in this\ncase,” houever, “is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by\nthird parties,” such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are “not acting at the behest of\nthe police.” /d. “Such an analysis is inherently speculative.” Jd.\n\nIn fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against\nMaxwell or Epstein’s estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going\nunsealing process in Giuffre v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein,\nDoe v. Indyke, No. 2o-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and moved to stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,\nsaying that continued <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> could threaten its case against Maxwell.\n\nBy contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v.\nMaxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in\nmisleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to\nBoies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allouing the unsealing process to\nunfold so it could make the inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument it nou makes. This Court should not\ncondone such gamesmanship.!\n\nThird, the government’s inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument is far too broad. Even the\ngovernment admits that the vast majority of material it obtained from Boies Schiller is not on the\nGiuffre v. Maxwell docket and has not been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the\ngovernment’s response appears to concede that its inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument is limited to\n\n' As the government recognizes, Judge Preska recognized this possibility, but deferred to this\nCourt on the question since it is presiding over the criminal case. Resp. at 94 n.4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 2o\nMaxwell’s two deposition transcripts, Resp. at 94 & n.4l. And as to Count 6 in particular\n(alleging perjury in the July 2ol6 deposition), the government concedes, as it must, that Judge\nPreska has refused to unseal all of the testimony charged in the indictment, except one question\nand one answer. Resp. at 94 n.4l. The government offers no explanation for hou it inevitably\nwould have obtained all 9o,ooo pages of material from Boies Schiller when the two deposition\ntranscripts don’t even total l,ooo pages.\n\nFourth, the government misunderstands the burden of proof. The government tries to\nfault Maxwell for seeking “suppression of a// evidence [it] obtained pursuant to the subpoena,”\ncalling this a “windfall.” Resp. at 95. But it’s the government’s burden to prove the applicability\nof the inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> exception. Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine\napplies only “if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably\nwithout the constitutional violation”) (rejecting government’s inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> claim). The\ngovernment must explain why Maxwell isn’t entitled to this remedy, not the other way around.\nThe government has fallen far, far short of meeting its burden, if only because it offers no\nargument—on the facts or the law—for hou it might have inevitably discovered more than\n89,ooo pages of material that hasn’t been and won’t be unsealed by Judge Preska. This Court\nshould have no confidence, much less a “high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies\nnecessary to the legal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of the contested evidence would be resolved in the government's\nfavor.” United States v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (articulating inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nstandard).\n\nThe inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> doctrine does not apply.\n\nII. The Government’s violation of Martindell requires suppression.\n\nThe government ignores the primary argument Maxwell made in her Motion: The\n\ngovernment circumvented Martindell, and deprived Maxwell of due process, by securing a\n?\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 2o\nMaxwell with perjury.* There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and\nBoies Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller’s conduct was in part at the government’s\nbehest.\n\nThe record in the Giuffre case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as\nwell. Based on Giuffre’s claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her\ndeposition, that Giuffre disclose any alleged “on-going criminal investigation by law\nenforcement” or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation.\nEx. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess “the\nimpact on any 5th Amendment privilege.” Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms.\nMaxwell the requested relief. Ex. B.\n\nThe day before Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition, houever, Judge Sweet ordered that\n“Tajny materials that [Giuffre] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over\n[by Giuffre] except for any statements made by [Giuffre] to law enforcement authority.” Ex. B, p\n2l. Maxwell had in fact served a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet\nGiuffre produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day.\n\nIn reliance on the Protective Order, which included no exception for any law enforcement\nneed or subpoena and based on Giuffre’s failure to disclose any “ongoing criminal\ninvestigation,” Maxwell did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nduring that deposition and testified truthfully.\n\nAs explained in Maxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the\ngovernment has nou disclosed several documents “with respect to any criminal investigations”\n\n> Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6, New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-story.html.\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo379o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 2o\ngovernment’s claim that its investigation of Maxwell did not start until 2ol8. But based on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provided to Maxwell in response to her Pretrial Motion No. 3, we knou the\ninvestigation actually began as early as 2ol6, when two months before Maxwell’s first\ndeposition, Boies Schiller met with the government and pressed an investigation for, among\nother things, perjury. This Court should adhere to Oshatz and, as the court there granted the\nmotion to quash, here it should grant the motion to suppress.\n\nThe government’s final argument is a red herring. Resp. at lo3. Maxwell’s argument is\nnot, and has never been, that a Protective Order cannot be modified. Maxwell agrees that, under\nMartindell, and after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to be heard,\nmodification of a Protective Order is appropriate if the government can shou “improvidence in\nthe grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling\nneed.” 594 F.2d at 296. Here, Maxwell was never given notice and an opportunity to be heard,\nand Chief Judge McMahon’s finding of “extraordinary circumstances” was fatally tainted by the\ngovernment’s misrepresentations to her about the origins of its investigation.\n\nIV. The Court should hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\nBecause there are genuine disputes of material fact, and for the reasons given in\nMaxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, this Court should hold an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (l) suppress all\nevidence the Government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived\ntherefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions and all evidence derived\ntherefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this\nMotion.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003798.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- QF AAR VAD UME ALLSD , FRNA BEI29 |p ApecEks of 8\nApp.-ol34\nhas atempted to join. Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of any such\ninvestigation.\n\nPlaintiff also seems to be claiming that she is part of this alleged investigation and, as a\nconsequence, has inappropriately atempted to claim a non-existent “investigative privilege”\nwhich has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public interest privilege.” Issues related\nto Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including her specious claims of privilege\nhave been raised and fully briefed. Ms. Maxwell incorporates her Motion to Compel Responses\nto Defendant’s First Set of <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Requests (Doc. # 75) and Reply in support thereof (Doc. #\n92), by reference.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell “cannot shou any significant reason for needing”\nthe information. This is, again, a meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to the information under the rules of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. And, the “need” for the information is\nboth obvious and necessary for at least three reasons: first, any communications between\nPlaintiff, her lawyers and law enforcement are likely inconsistent with statements Plaintiff has\nmade to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff's motive and bias in bringing this\nlitigation; and third, knouing the information will allou Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on\nany 5\" Amendment privilege. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the\ninformation or accept a stay in the proceedings as a consequence of her failure to comply with\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations. She should not be alloued to brandish this, likely nonexistent, sword\nbut deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> maters.

This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page7of8\nThe Hon.

But a non-prosecution\nagreement is not an ordinary contract. Federal prosecutors knou hou to draft clear limitations\non promises made to criminal defendants, and they have a unique obligation to do so. What\nstrains “common sense” is the notion that any reasonable prosecutor who intended the NPA to be\nread as the government contends would have omited the limitations and modifications the\ngovernment nou seeks—particularly when dealing with a defendant who sought to “resolve\nglobally” his criminal liability.

The Court should therefore decline the government’s\ninvitation to rewrite the NPA to its liking, should enforce the NPA as writen, and should grant\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion.\n\nIn the alternative, the Court should permit <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and hold an evidentiary hearing to\ndetermine the parties’ intent with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that the NPA unambiguously bars her prosecution here, and that neither\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> nor a hearing is necessary for the Court to grant this motion, the government’s\narguments regarding the NPA parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the consideration\nof evidence. Because Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty, has no personal knouledge regarding the\nparties’ intent and no access to relevant documents, she should be permited to take <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nadvance of any hearing.\n\nl. The NPA Applies to Ms. Maxwell, and She Has Standing to Enforce It.\n\nThe NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision forecloses “any criminal charges against\nany potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to” four named individuals.\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). The phrase “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” obviously\nincludes Ms. Maxwell. As the opening statement of the Indictment makes clear: “The charges\n“Opp.” refers herein to the Government’s Omnibus Opposition to the Defendant’s Pre-Trial Motions.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof23\n\nIn sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a “potential co-conspirator of\nEpstein,” and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nI. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4. Rather, in interpreting a plea agreement, “[t]he court looks to the\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l6 of 23\nconsider extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intent.’ To the extent that the Court finds that\nextrinsic evidence is relevant, houever, the government’s argument demonstrates precisely why\nthe Court should permit <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this action. While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Any evidence of the parties’ intent would be in the possession of\nthe government and Epstein’s counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few\nclues available to the public—such as a privilege log filed in a related civil lawsuit—for crumbs\nof information about the negotiation and investigation.\n\nThe government’s response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic\nevidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—\nshould be preceded by <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three\npages from the above-referenced privilege log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims,\nall of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL’s consultation with the United States\nAtorney’s Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL atorneys to New York, or interviews\nand/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses. Mem. at ll (citing Privilege Log, Doe v.\nUnited States, Case No. 9:o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. No. 2l2-l (filed July l9, 2ol3)\n(“SDFL Privilege Log”), at 4, 5, 7). In response, the government has focused on only one of\nthose three entries and produced the documents referenced in the privilege log. See Opp. lo.\n\n7 The government’s argument that a United States Atorney lacks the “authority” to bind other districts (Opp. l3-\nl4)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Atorney has\nnot received the approvals prescribed by internal Justice Department guidelines—is unavailing. The government\ncites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not\nonly by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other\ndistricts—but also by the Second Circuit’s statement that a United States Atorney may bind other districts in a plea\nagreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect.

Harvey, 79l F.2d\n294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986); Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672.\n\nl2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l7 of 23\nThe other two documents remain unavailable to Ms. Maxwell—as, presumably, do other\ndocuments whose existence cannot be discovered in the public record. Nor has Ms. Maxwell\nhad the opportunity to question those involved in the investigation and negotiation. It is patently\nunreasonable for the government to blame Ms. Maxwell for failing to produce evidence relating\nto the investigation and negotiation leading up to the NPA, while simultaneously opposing her\nrequest for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and cherry-picking its responses to the limited publicly available\ninformation she has been able to identify. That limited information has already yielded\nsupportive documents and more will no doubt follou with further <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nWil. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision Is Not Limited to the 2ool-o7 Time Period\n\nor to Violations of Specific Statutes.\n\nThe government’s argument that the co-conspirator immunity provision does not apply to\nthe time period or the offenses charged in the Indictment consists of (l) asserting that the NPA\nsays things it does not, in fact, say and (ll) atacking a strawman position, never asserted by Ms.\nMaxwell, that the NPA gives Ms. Maxwell carte blanche immunity from federal prosecution for\nall past and future criminal conduct of any kind, wherever and whenever commited. The co-\nconspirator immunity provision simply does not contain the limitations the government nou\nseeks to atribute to it, and Ms. Maxwell’s position that it prohibits the Mann Act charges against\nher is entirely reasonable.*\n\nFirst, the government’s assertion that “the NPA contains detailed provisions that limit the\nscope of the crimes immunized in the agreement” is simply not true. See Opp. l5. The NPA\ncontains only vague limitations as to the scope of Epstein’s immunity, and no limitations\nwhatsoever as to the scope of immunity for potential co-conspirators.\n\n* To be clear, Ms. Maxwell does not assert that the NPA forecloses the perjury counts of the Indictment, which arise\nout of alleged post-NPA conduct.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo389o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003893.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 2o of 23\nmaxwell-arrested-jeffrey-epstein-aide/2495762/). Such an interpretation, rather than an insertion\ninto the co-conspirator immunity provision of arbitrary limitations designed to satisfy the\ngovernment’s interests here, is the “common-sense way to read the NPA” that the Court should\nadopt. See Opp. l6.\n\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Conduct <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> and an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, Counts One through Four have been brought in breach\nof the NPA and should be dismissed. The text of the NPA, read as a whole, unambiguously bars\nMs. Maxwell’s prosecution here, and the government is reduced to arguing that the parties must\nhave meant to write various provisions of the NPA differently than they actually did. These\narguments are manifestly inadequate, and they should be rejected.\n\nShould the Court have any doubt about the parties’ intent, houever, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and an\nevidentiary hearing regarding the parties’ intent are warranted. The government’s arguments\nregarding the parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the presentation of evidence. For\nexample, to the extent that the scope of offenses for which the NPA immunized Epstein is\ndeemed relevant to the co-conspirator immunity provision, that scope cannot be delineated\nwithout determining precisely which offenses might have arisen out of the investigation by the\nFBI and the USAO-SDFL (including the investigation into “Epstein’s background”), as well as\nwhich offenses arose out of the undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation.” Similarly, the\ngovernment’s claims that the parties did not intend to confer the benefit of immunity on Ms.\nMaxwell, and that the parties intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the\nSDFL, raise issues regarding the scope of the SDFL investigation, the USAO-SDFL’s awareness\nof Ms. Maxwell, and the extent to which the investigation involved this District. These issues\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003894.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 2l of 23\ncannot be resolved in the government’s favor on this record, and the plain language of the NPA\ncannot be disregarded without <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government argues that Ms. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\nbecause she has not submited affidavits, and that she is not entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> because she has\noffered only “conjecture.” Opp. 22. But unlike the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell has\nsubmited evidence far more pouerful than an affidavit claiming an oral agreement: she has\nsubmited the NPA itself, which, on its face, bars her prosecution. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at\nl84, l9o (hearing based on oral representations made to defendant); United States v. Aleman,\n286 F.3d 86, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo2) (granting hearing where defendant submited atorney affidavits\nalleging oral agreement); United States v. Satar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo3)\n(same). Ms. Maxwell’s contention that the plain language of the NPA reflects the parties’ intent\nis not “conjecture,” and the Court cannot find to the contrary without hearing evidence—\nevidence that we anticipate would confirm that the parties intended the NPA to mean exactly\nwhat it says and that it bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, but is unavailable to Ms. Maxwell\nwithout <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.'°\n\"Tn addition, unlike the defendants in the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell was a nonparty to the NPA, and\nher atorneys thus have neither firsthand knouledge of the parties’ intent nor access to evidence regarding the\nparties’ intent. While the government points out that Ms. Maxwell has not submited an affidavit from Epstein’s\ncounsel, defense counsel notes that it has made several unsuccessful atempts to obtain information from Jay\nLefkouitz, the atorney who was principally involved in negotiating the language of the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 22 of 23\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth herein, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that her motion to\ndismiss be granted.

Although the defense has expressed concerns that trial on the S2\nIndictment would be excessively long, and that the defense would need additional time to prepare\nfor trial, balanced against the two counts added by the S2 Indictment are the two perjury counts\nsevered by the Court’s April l6, 2o2l opinion and order. (Dkt. No. 2o7). In other words, the\ndefense has long maintained that the perjury counts would substantially expand the scope of the\ntrial, but those counts will no longer be at issue during trial in July.\n\nAs the Court may recall, in the defense’s view, the Mann Act and perjury counts involved\nat most “some minimal amount of overlapping evidence,” which was “far outweighed b[y] the\nmuch larger inefficiency of substantially lengthening and complicating the trial.” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat l2). According to the defense, a trial including the perjury counts would have “necessarily\ninvolve[d] litigating a complicated defamation action within a criminal trial,” and possibly require\nresolution of “[a]pproximately 5o substantive motions” and “evidentiary challenges to thousands\nof deposition questions and answers contained in dozens of bankers boxes.” (/d. at 9-lo, l2). The\ndefense also identified more than a dozen areas of evidence that it claimed would be part of the\nperjury trial, including “hou <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is obtained” in civil litigation, “[t]he testimony of ten to\nfifteen other witnesses including fact and expert witnesses” on materiality, and “[t]he testimony of\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers.” (Dkt No. 224 at 7-8). As a result, in the defense’s view, if the perjury\ncounts were tried together with the Mann Act counts, “this criminal trial will be subsumed by\nevidence not relevant to the main charges, the Mann Act Counts.” (/d. at 8).\n\nThe Government has never understood the perjury counts to require the resolution of\ndozens of motions from the civil case or the trial testimony of dozens of witnesses above and\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 _ Filed o4/22/2l Page5oflo\nPage 5\n\nSecond, the Government will continue to take steps to ensure that the defense is able to\nprepare for trial as scheduled. As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government has already\nincluded Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> relating to the S2 Indictment in its prior productions to the defense,\nand the Government has provided the defense with a list of pages within those <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproductions that are particularly pertinent to the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment.”\nContrary to the defense’s suggestion in its most recent leter, the largest <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production in\nthis case came from electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein. That production, dated\nNovember l8, 2o2o, included approximately l.2 million documents (totaling approximately 2.2\nmillion pages), all of which are text searchable and were produced in a format conducive to loading\nthat production into a document review platform.? Moreover, the defense’s suggestion that it will\nneed to re-review every single page of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to date is, at best, hyperbolic. The\ndefense has already reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and presumably knous which portions relate in\n> To the extent the defense complains of recent difficulties reviewing certain Highly Confidential\nimages or other items that must be reviewed in the presence of federal agents, it bears noting that\nthe Government repeatedly informed defense counsel beginning in the fall of 2o2o that those\nmaterials would be made available for review upon request. The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o. The Government\nis working with its staff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into and, where possible,\naddress the defense’s concerns as quickly as possible.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nparticular to the time period covered by the S2 Indictment, especially with the guidance provided\nby the Government regarding key documents relevant to Minor Victim-4. Given that the largest\nportion of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case is text searchable, the defense will also be able to tailor any\nre-review of those materials through relevant search terms. The combination of having already\npossessed the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for months and receiving a list of key documents should\nmeaningfully assist the defense in preparing for trial as scheduled.\n\nThe Government has also commited to providing further disclosures well in advance of\ntrial and far earlier than such productions would ordinarily be made in this District. The\nGovernment has already begun producing materials relating to witnesses whom it does not intend\nto call at trial to the defense, more than three months in advance of trial. The bulk of those\nmaterials were produced on April l3, 2o2l, and the Government intends to make additional\nproductions on a rolling basis as it continues to review its files for such materials. In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this production with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted throughout the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall production. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to investigate or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page 7 of lo\nPage 7\nat trial. Simply put, the defense does not need to investigate crimes with which the defendant is\nnot charged.\n\nMoreover, the defense’s most recent leter refers to these materials as somehou\nconstituting Brady material without any explanation of what information within the most recent\nproduction is supposedly exculpatory. But given that, as noted above, a significant majority of the\nnon-testifying witness materials do not reference the defendant, to the extent the defense is\nsuggesting that the existence of victims who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein without assistance\nfrom the defendant constitutes Brady material, the Government has repeatedly noted that such\nevidence is not exculpatory. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 65 at l-2; Dkt. No. 2o4 at 47-48 (citing, inter\nalia, United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A defendant may not seek to\nestablish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal acts on specific\noccasions.”’))). Regardless, the defense has ample time to review these materials in advance of\ntrial, and the Government intended to produce all of these materials to the defense with or without\na superseding indictment.* Thus, the defense would have needed to review and investigate these\nmaterials even if the Government never obtained the S2 Indictment. Although the defense claims\n4 The Government understands from defense counsel that the CD containing a copy of this\nproduction, which the Government sent to the MDC via FedEx overnight shipping last week, has\nnot been provided to the defendant. The Government has repeatedly asked MDC legal counsel to\nlocate this CD and provide it to the defendant, and today MDC legal counsel confirmed that the\nCD would be delivered to the defendant this afternoon.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has gone to significant lengths to address the technical\nissues defense counsel have raised with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and to ensure that the defendant\nexpeditiously receives copies of each production. Indeed, in November 2o2o, the undersigned\nhand delivered a laptop and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production to the MDC for the defendant, and the\nGovernment understands the defendant received those items that same day. Although it is not\nfeasible for the Government to hand deliver every production to the MDC, the Government has\ninformed defense counsel that the undersigned will hand deliver the Government’s first production\nof Giglio and Jencks Act material to the MDC to minimize any delay in the defendant’s ability to\naccess that material when it is produced.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page8oflo\nPage 8\nthat its investigation of the witnesses referenced in these materials will take months, it fails to\nexplain in any detail what specific steps it needs to take, why those steps are material to preparing\na defense, or hou those steps would be particularly expected to lead to admissible evidence at trial.\n\nAdditionally, the Government has agreed to provide the defense with expert notice by April\n23, 2o2l and the names of the victims referenced in the S2 Indictment by May l7, 2o2l. The\nGovernment has also agreed to provide notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), a\nproposed witness list, Jencks Act material, and Giglio material 45 days in advance of trial. As a\nresult, the defense will receive many of these disclosures weeks in advance of when is typical for\ncriminal defendants in this District, thereby further ensuring ample time to prepare for trial. To\nthe extent the defense claims that it will need to retain additional experts to review electronic\nevidence, it appears that would be true regardless of the S2 Indictment because the electronic\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials referenced in the defense’s most recent leter were already part of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nin this case before the S2 Indictment was returned. In any event, the defense will receive the\nGovernment’s expert disclosure tomorrou, thereby providing more than two months for the\ndefense to consider whether it wishes to offer any responsive expert(s). Further, the defense’s\nsuggestion that it has insufficient time to file additional motions is undercut by the proposed\nschedule agreed upon by the parties, which allous the defense to file its supplemental pretrial\nmotions more than five weeks after the return of the S2 Indictment and its motions in /imine more\nthan eight weeks from today and eleven weeks from the return of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAlthough the defense claims that its trial preparation will be hampered by the COVID-l9\npandemic, the availability of vaccines to all adults in the United States should enable the defense\nteam to conduct any necessary investigation far more expeditiously than was possible a few\nmonths ago. Further, the defense’s concerns that jury selection will be lengthy or cumbersome in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page lo of lo\nPage lo\nas scheduled, and has already planned to be available to testify at trial as scheduled this summer,\ndespite her personal and professional obligations.

(Dkt. No. 2o7).\nA. Overview\nThe Government takes its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and disclosure obligations seriously, and it has\nendeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the\npendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ndisclosure plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks\nAct obligations with respect to the materials already in the possession of the prosecution team, but\nthat it also makes reasonable efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the\nfiles of other investigative agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was\nformulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 Filed o4/23/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nWith respect to Atorney-l’s inbox, the Government previewed in its October 7, 2o2o leter\nthat it planned to review the inbox—which is voluminous’—using search terms to identify witness\nstatements and Giglio material. Those search terms did not include search terms relevant to the\nNPA, and the Government has not searched Atorney-l’s inbox for communications relating to the\nNPA. Instead, because the Government obtained these materials with an eye touards identifying\nany additional witness statements or Giglio material that might not otherwise be contained in the\nFBI Florida File, the Government ran search terms specific to this case, focusing on the names of\nvictims, Government witnesses, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government’s review of the emails\nresponsive to its search terms remains ongoing, and the Government will produce any non-\nduplicative documents that warrant disclosure. The Government expects this to be a limited set of\ndocuments that will be produced along with other Jencks Act and Giglio material. Of course,\nshould the Government identify any exculpatory material during this review, including with\nrespect to the NPA, it will promptly produce such material.\n\nAs the foregoing illustrates, the Government has taken an expansive approach to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nand is close to completing its review of files from other agencies for Jencks Act and Giglio\nmaterial. Thus far, the Government has not identified potential Brady material with respect to the\nNPA during its review. To the extent the Government identifies potential Brady material with\nrespect to the NPA, that is, material that supports Maxwell’s reading of the NPA as discussed\nabove, or any other exculpatory material, the Government will promptly produce it. Houever,\n> More specifically, it appears that OPR obtained an entire snapshot of Atorney-l’s inbox,\nspanning several years, and encompassing all of Atorney-l’s emails during that time period.

The conspiracy\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance. The need to research\nMs. Maxwell’s whereabouts during a full eleven year period, not to mention comb the millions\nof pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> including travel records, phone records, bank records, photographs, diaries,\nmessage pads, credit card records, and countless other records for the eleven-year versus four\nyear period, will take hundreds, if not thousands, of atorney and staff hours.\n\nC. The new, and old, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> require review (and re-review) and analysis.\n\nThe government, on April l3, 2o2l, produced more than 2o,ooo pages of “new”\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Although the government represented that this production is related to “non-testifying\nwitnesses,” it is more accurately described as exculpatory Brady material. Notably, the\ngovernment has possessed most of this information for years (in some cases, more than a decade)\nand has resisted disclosure until after the filing of the second superseding indictment and on the\neve of trial.2, Many of the reports recently produced stem from the years 2oo6-2oo8.\n\n?

Generally, the\nwitnesses fall into several categories: alleged Epstein victims, former Epstein employees,\npotential targets of the Epstein investigation, or percipient witnesses. There are two good reasons\nthat these witnesses will not be government trial witnesses: they say things that help Ms.\nMaxwell or are patently unbelievable.\n\nThis review is just begun, ongoing, and not nearly finished. Although the government\n“produced” the materials to defense counsel on April l3, 2o2l, as of today’s date, Ms. Maxwell\nstill has not yet received this <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and has not been able to review it personally and with her\ncounsel. The government has represented that it sent a CD with the materials to the MDC the\nsame it was produced to defense counsel. Defense counsel also delivered a hard drive to the\ngovernment on April l3, 2o2l to load the materials so that Ms. Maxwell could review the\nmaterials on the laptop, which does not have a CD drive. Ms. Maxwell has received neither.\n\nThe government claimed that the hard-drive took several days to load, and that it currently is\nsomewhere in the mailroom at MDC. With less than 9o days before trial, the inability for Ms.\nMaxwell to review more than 2o,ooo pages of largely exculpatory material presents a significant\nimpediment to her trial preparation.\n\nDefense counsel anticipate that simply reading the material and discussing it with Ms.\nMaxwell (who still does not have the information) will take will take weeks. Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof access to the information (actual and logistical) combined with the age of the allegations and\nMaxwell lacked knouledge of Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme, were only produced to her\ncounsel (and not her) on April l3, 2o2l.

Although investigation will vary depending on the\n\ncircumstances, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,\n\nafter consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of\n\nthe criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the\n\npossession of the prosecution, law enforcement authorities, and others, as well as\n\nindependent investigation. Counsel’s investigation should also include evaluation\n\nof the prosecution’s evidence (including possible re-testing or re-evaluation of\n\nphysical, forensic, and expert evidence) and consideration of inconsistencies,\n\npotential avenues of impeachment of prosecution witnesses, and other possible\nsuspects and alternative theories that the evidence may raise.\nId. at (c).\n\nMost significantly, because the government expressly represented in their prior\ncommunications to the Court and to counsel that they would not be seeking to introduce\nevidence from the 2ooos (apart from the perjury counts), counsel for Ms. Maxwell has already\nundertaken a review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> focused on the l99os and the allegations in the Sl\nindictment.

Continuing problems with the government’s evidence production require\n\nadditional time\n\nIn addition to the “new” 2o,ooo pages of exculpatory evidence not yet provided to Ms.\nMaxwell, defense counsel and Ms. Maxwell have encountered significant obstacles in the review\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced prior to April l3\". The production made to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC\ncontains hundreds or thousands of missing Bates-numbers.

The metadata\nassociated with thousands of these photographs that were produced to counsel (but missing from\nMs. Maxwell’s production) were stripped and included in Excel spreadsheets. One of the Excel\nspreadsheets is not functioning, and the government has been asked to provide a replacement.\nThe two functioning Excel spreadsheets contain the file names, not the Bates-stamps, of the\nassociated photographs, so there is no way to match the photographs with its metadata. The\nExcel spreadsheets contains both photographs that were produced to counsel and also\nphotographs that were not produced, without identifying which is which. Moreover, the\ngovernment did not indicate on the file names or the spreadsheets which photographs it\nconsidered “Highly Confidential” under the case’s protective order.\n\nBeginning on April l3, 2o2l, Ms. Maxwell and one or more of her lawyers undertook an\nevidence review in the courthouse in conjunction with the prosecution and FBI. Under the terms\nof the protective order, defense counsel are not alloued to possess “highly confidential material.”\nThe 4 days set aside to review this material was insufficient. The government placed\napproximately 5,ooo images it contends are Highly Confidential on two hard drives. When\ndefense counsel first atempted to view the images, the one laptop designated for the task by the\ngovernment was insufficient either because of the laptop or the software on the laptop. On\nThursday, April l5, a functioning computer was provided to defense counsel. A review of the\nimages revealed no good reason why the hard drives, which do not appear to contain prohibited\nvisual depictions restricted byl8 U.S. § 2256, cannot be copied and provided to defense counsel.\nThe sheer number of images make it impossible for any effective review to take place in a\ngovernment office with various proctors.

The new charges and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> require the assistance of defense experts\n\nIn addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of\npotential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized\nknouledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is nou potentially relevant due to the\nexpanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential\nhard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual\nfile creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government\nhas not identified any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic\nexaminers may be necessary to analyze the exhibits.\n\nMs. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 2o,ooo pages of “new” material to\nprovide that information to potential defense experts for consideration. None of this can happen\nin time to make appropriate disclosures in advance of trial. See United States v. Santos, No. S 9l\nCR. 724 (CSH), l99l WL 248784 at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to\nsupplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P l2 motions relating to\nthe second superseding indictment.

In addition, expert\ndisclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and has had insufficient access to existing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along\nwith the late disclosure of Brady material and failure to provide the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to Ms. Maxwell\nhave delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that\nwould normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings. Simply stated, Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel cannot perform all of the necessary tasks in the time remaining before July l2, 2o2l.\n\nII. Requested Relief\nIn United States v.

As the Defendant’s\nresponse makes clear, she seeks to serve a Rule l7 subpoena on BSF because she is dissatisfied\nwith the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> efforts thus far. Thus, she is using Rule l7 to atempt to obtain\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that she has been unable to obtain from the Government under Rule l6 and Brady,\nincluding <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that is subject to a pending motion before the Court. This is an improper use\nof a Rule l7 subpoena. If the Defendant believes that the Government has not fulfilled its\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, she must address that issue with the\nGovernment and the Court rather than serving overbroad and burdensome subpoenas on third\nparties. And if the Defendant is not entitled to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> she seeks from the Government, then\n: The Defendant refers to BSF’s objections as a “motion to quash,” but the Court has not yet\ngranted Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena to BSF.

For this reason and the additional reasons\nexplained belou, the Court should deny the Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena to BSF.\nl, Requests l-5: Communications About the Defendant and\n\nA. The Requests Are Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that Requests l through 5—\nfor a broad range of communications between BSF and others about the Defendant and gy\nWm —clear Nixon’s hurdles of relevancy, admissibility, and specificity. See United States v.\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7oo (l974). As to specificity, Maxwell first argues that Requests l through\n5 are sufficiently specific because they “are specific as to date and limited by the identified\nindividuals and subject mater.” Resp. Ltr. at 2. But the specificity hurdle requires more. “In order\nto avoid speculation that the moving party is using Rule l7(c) to circumvent normal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nrequirements, the party’s Rule l7(c) subpoena must be able to reasonably specify the information\ncontained or believed to be contained in the documents sought rather than merely hope that\nsomething useful will turn up.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, “[r]equests for any and all\ncommunications, even if tied to specific documents and topics, are potentially ‘fishing expeditions’\nfor unspecified materials and insufficiently specific under United States v. Nixon.” United States\nv. Bergstein, No. l6-CR-746 (PKC), 2ol8 WL 9539775, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l, 2ol8).\n\nThe Defendant’s broad requests for all of BSF’s communications with certain individuals\nand entities about general topics over a years-long time period do not meet the specificity\nrequirement, just like numerous of the defendant’s requests in Avenati failed the specificity\nrequirement. For example, Judge Gardephe held that Mr. Avenati’s “request for all audio\nrecordings (and transcripts thereof) (l) involving [eight designated individuals]; (2) that contain a\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4oo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page6ofl7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Defendant has failed to explain hou the communications sought in Requests l\nthrough 5 will be relevant and admissible at trial, and only points to three pending pre-trial motions.\n\nSecond, although BSF cannot fully respond to the Defendant’s relevance arguments as to\nthe Defendant’s two motions to suppress because it has not been provided unredacted versions of\nthose motions and because it has not been provided a copy of the Defendant’s ex parte motion,'\none thing is clear—it is not conceivable that every communication the Defendant requests in\nRequests l through 5 would be relevant and admissible at an evidentiary hearing on her motions.\nA defendant must demonstrate that all of the evidence it seeks pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena\nwould be relevant and admissible, not just that the defendant is likely to find something relevant\nand admissible in the nonparty’s production. See, e.g., United States v. Pena, No. l5 Cr. 55l\n(AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

See\nBouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l).\n\nThird, the Defendant has not even atempted to demonstrate that all of the evidence she\nseeks would be admissible. Although the lack of specificity in Requests l through 5 makes it\nimpossible to meaningfully debate the admissibility of each piece of evidence she seeks, certainly\nmany of the communications requested will constitute inadmissible hearsay. This is precisely the\npurpose of Nixon’s specificity requirement—to ensure that Rule l7 subpoenas are narrouly\ntailored to obtain only relevant and admissible evidence, not to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the hopes that\nsomething relevant and admissible might turn up, and to allou the recipient to lodge relevance and\nadmissibility objections as to the precise documents being requested.

As a result, courts must be mindful not to allou the Rule l7(c) process to become a\n“broad <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> device” that would undermine the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> procedures set forth in Rule l6.\nUnited States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995). Thus, if an item is not\ndiscoverable under Rule l6, a party cannot make it discoverable simply by subpoenaing it under\nRule l7. United States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4-CR-l86 (SCR), 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8).\n\nTo determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the\nfactors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo. To clear that hurdle,\nthe Court considers (l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. /d. at 7oo.\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nA. The BSF Subpoena\n\nThe proposed subpoena makes twelve requests. Some of the requests relate to documents\nthat Maxwell believes will be relevant at trial. For others, the proffered relevance relates to\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page3of9\nMaxwell’s pending motions to suppress evidence. While ordinarily Rule l7(c) is “trial-focused”\nand “may be used only to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial,” at least some courts\nhave held that Rule l7(c) can be used to compel the production of documents in connection with\na suppression hearing. United States v. Louis, No. o4-CR-2o3 (LTS), 2oo5 WL l8o885, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2oo5). Even then, the requests fail for the reasons stated belou.\n\nRequests l through 5 all fail on the basis that they do not comply with Nixon’s specificity\nrequirement. Requests l through 5 all target communications between “any” ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of BSF and government officials or co-counsel in civil\nlitigation, from 2ol5 to the date of the subpoena. While the requests focus on a certain subject,\nthe requests are so overbroad that issuance of the Rule l7(c) subpoena would be improper. As\nset forth in the subpoena, the term “communications” encompasses “all forms of correspondence,\nincluding regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other writen communication of\ninformation of any kind.” The use of the terms “all” and “any” “do not evince specificity.”\nUnited States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l WL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6,\n2o2l). Here, the requests do not identify specific lawyers or employees of BSF whose\ncommunications are relevant. See United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol7) (discussing that while an originally requested subpoena was insufficiently specific, a new\nrequested subpoena satisfied the specificity requirement because it identified a specified set of\nindividuals whose records were sought). The requests also encompass “all” forms of\ncorrespondence without limitation. And while the requested subpoenas are limited to the period\nbetween 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. These requests are precisely the\nkind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to prevent. See Bouman\nDairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l. Indeed, the requests are akin to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests in civil litigation.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page4of9\nSee United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9-CR-373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. 6, 2o2o). But Rule l7(c) subpoenas are not tools of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698;\nWey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253. On the specificity prong alone, Requests | through 5 fail to satisfy\nthe Nixon standard.\n\nRequests l and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials\nsought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests l, 2, and 8 all seek documents\nthat are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests l and 2 seek\ncommunications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2ol5\nto the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that\nthe Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government’s failure to comply with its\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be\notherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the\nhands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government\nhas not met its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, the Rule l7(c) subpoena process is not the proper\nmechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly\njoined, Maxwell must make some shouing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief\nfrom this Court.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement leters between BSF\nand two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required shouing\nunder Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule l7(c)\napplication. The only plausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l  Page6of9\njury subpoena at issue in Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that\nproduction suggests coordination between the Government and BSF. Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them. This Court knous well that the Government has not always lived up to those\nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good\nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum,\nnone of Maxwell’s theories justify production of these documents under the Rule l7(c) process.\n\nRequest l2, which seeks “‘any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation\nProgram made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks\n“any” submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell\noffered to narrou this request to just those materials submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action.\n\nThe request’s failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of\nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this\nrequest, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submited to the EVCP.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 26o _ Filed o4/3o/2l Pagelof2\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY lo:\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP i er eo\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

It also adds two new charges: Count 5 of\nthe S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy between\n2ool and 2oo4, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating in the sex trafficking of a minor\nor aiding and abeting the same.

Third, defense counsel must\nbalance preparing for trial with considering and preparing any supplemental pre-trial motions in\nresponse to the new charges contained in the S2 Indictment. Although the perjury counts were\nrecently severed, the Court cannot conclude that this sufficiently offsets the additional burdens\nplaced on the defense as a result of the new charges and expanded timeframe resulting from the\nS2 indictment.\n\nThe Court is very mindful of the countervailing considerations that require that any\nadjournment be no longer than necessary.

Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 3\n26.2(f) Advisory Commitee’s Note, l979 Addition. Houever, like the Jencks Act, the Rule\nrequires disclosure of witness statements only after a witness has testified on direct examination.\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a); see also Scoti, 47 F.3d at l25o (“The plain language of\nboth Rule 26.2 and l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) shous that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> procedure therein outlined\napplies only to statements that must be produced after a witness testifies[.]”) (internal quotation\nomited)); United States v. Felt, 5o2 F. Supp. 7l, 74 (D.D.C. l98o) (“access is to be permited\nafter the defense witness has testified on direct examination”). A district court therefore lacks\nauthority to order early disclosure statements of prospective defense witnesses.\n\nDue to their similarities, federal courts look to decisions interpreting l8 U.S.C. § 35oo in\norder to interpret Rule 26.2. The Second Circuit has long maintained that “the Jencks Act\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.” United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool). See also In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987); United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974) (‘the trial judge is\nprevented by the Jencks Act from ordering pretrial disclosure of statements made by a\nprospective government witness over the government’s objection”). Cf United States v. Benson,\n2o F.R.D. 6o2, 6o5 (S.D.N.Y. l957) (holding that Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (l953)\ndoes not apply until “a witness is called to the witness stand”).\n\nBecause the court cannot compel the government to provide early Jencks Act or Rule\n26.2 disclosures to the defense — and the defense is not entitled to it by virtue of statute — it\nnecessarily follous that the court cannot compel the same material from the defense. See\nWardius v. Oregon, 4l2 U.S. 47o, 475-76 (l973). A district court can only “encourage” the\npractice of early disclosure. See Percevault, 49o F.2d at l32.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004087.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page4of/7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 4\nI. The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v.

(Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. l48 at lo).\n\nThe defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference\nto her. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2\nhave acknouledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2\nis expected to testify to that fact at trial. (See Gov’t Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87 (citing\nMem. in Opp. to Def.’s Renewed Motion for Release, Dkt. No. loo at ll n.2.); 3/22/2l Leter from\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5). The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and\nproduce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 2o7 at 29).\nAs the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that\nMinor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no\nentries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t\nOmnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87). The victim provided the Government with her entries\nrelating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.). The remainder\nof the diary consists of Minor Victim-2’s unrelated personal diary entries, and the defendant has\nnot explained and cannot explain why she needs to review those entries to establish a fact that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page5of9\nPage 5\n\n(N.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, l989) (reaching the unremarkable result that an “undercover agent’s diary” is\n“not discoverable in and of itself” except “to the extent that this diary contains” Brady material).\n\nAlternatively, the defendant states that she needs to inspect the “entire journal” to\n“establish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoilation has\noccurred.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). “This examination,” she continues,\n“requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner.” (/d.) This argument lacks\nmerit. The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity\nof the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly\nauthenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use,\nwhat kind of examination will occur, or hou that examination might bear on the journal’s\nauthenticity. See Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253 (explaining that the “items sought cannot merely be\npotentially relevant or admissible. Rather, they must be shoun to be relevant and admissible at\nthe time the subpoena is sought.” (internal quotation marks omited)); see also United States v.\nSkelos, No. l5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

It also appears that the\nGovernment also produced copies of some of these photographs in Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. In any\nevent, and again although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government requested\nthat BSF provide it with copies of the complete set of requested photographs, which it has obtained\nand produced to the defendant.\n\nRemaining at issue, then, are only the original versions of the photographs. The\nGovernment understands from BSF that the photographs were all taken on film and are not digital\nphotographs. Accordingly, the originals are physical photographs, not digital files. The defense\nsubpoena for these original photographs should be denied, at least unless and until the defendant\nprovides further justification for the need for and entitlement to the originals. Because the\ndefendant already has copies of the photographs, the defendant must explain hou her request for\nthe originals can satisfy the Nixon test without being “otherwise procurable.” 4l8 U.S. at 699.\n\nThe defendant suggests that she needs the originals to identify the “dates of creation or any\nother specifics.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at ll). It is entirely unclear what “other\nspecifics” refers to, but as noted above, the Government understands that these photographs were\ntaken on film, such that the originals would generally not contain metadata regarding the date or\nother information regarding when they were taken.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document273 Filed o5/o7/2l Pagelofl\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Ney Ya NEO\nWW. cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

Given the complexities in this case, including a large volume of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,\ncomplex litigation history, years of investigation, and significant time invested with victim-\nwitnesses, continuity of Government counsel at trial is a particularly compelling interest here.

The Government respectfully submits that the\nGovernment’s proposed trial date—which is only three weeks after the date requested by the\ndefense—is reasonable in light of the interests described above and where defense counsel\noriginally requested a continuance of trial to November 8, 2o2l contingent upon the re-scheduling\nof a conflicting trial and alternatively requested a trial date of January lo, 2o22.4 (Dkt.

PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST IS PREMATURE\n\nFirst, the request to exceed the presumptive ten-deposition limit is premature. “[C]ourts\ngenerally will not grant leave to expand the number of depositions until the moving party has\nexhausted the ten depositions permited as of right under Rule 3o(a)(2)(A) or the number\nstipulated to by the opposing party,” Gen.

(citing Barrou v.\nGreenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2o2 F.R.D. 48o, 482 (N.D.Tex. 2ool)). This rule is in place because\n“a party could indirectly circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum alloted\nnumber to those that she could not justify under the Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek{[ ]\nleave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate.” Jd. at 483.\n\nHere, Plaintiff seeks a pre-emptive determination that she should be permited l7\ndepositions, almost twice the presumptive limit, yet her proposed depositions are not calculated\nto lead to admissible evidence in this case. By way of example, Plaintiff identifies Nadia\nMarcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or Sarah Vickers), and Jeffrey Epstein as\nalleged “co-conspirators” with each other. She requests the depositions of each. Plaintiff\nanticipates each will invoke the Fifth Amendment — in other words, she will not obtain any\ndiscoverable information from them.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004206.jpg": "Casask 4olg -Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FildechemMene! pdgage cf afil2\n\nPlaintiff makes a bizarre argument that somehou this testimony can be used to create an\nadverse inference against Ms. Maxwell,’ despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell did not invoke the\nFifth Amendment and she testified fully and answered every question posed to her with the only\nexception the irrelevant and harassing questions Plaintiff posed to her concerning her adult,\nconsensual sexual activities. In other words, depositions of Marcincova, Kellen and Epstein\nwould serve Plaintiff's goal to make a convoluted legal argument, not to actually seek\ndiscoverable information. In light of this, the “burden or expense of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\noutweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the parties' resources, the\nimportance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in resolving\nthe issues.” Atkinson v.

Plaintiff's\nallegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the\ncountry. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell.

As discussed above, such invocation has no\nbearing on the issues in this mater.

Thus, it is unclear hou these individuals have information that differs from\nor would add to the other proposed deponents.

Rather, each\nwitness identified as being able to provide their observations regarding “other” allegedly\nunderage girls, their oun personal experience,” or beliefs about Plaintiff's credibility. None of\nthis is relevant. This is not a case about Jeffery Epstein or the alleged “modus operandi of the\nEpstein organization.” This is a simple case of if Ms. Maxwell’s denial of the allegations made\nby Plaintiff about Plaintiff's oun interactions with Maxwell was defamatory, and if Ms. Maxwell\nacted with actual malice in issuing the denial. Plaintiffs atempt to amplify this proceeding into\nsomething broader should not be condoned.\n\nBecause the evidence sought is nothing more than extraneous inadmissible\n“circumstantial evidence”’ irrelevant to proving the essential elements of the claim, “the burden\nor expense of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the\ncase, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in resolving the issues.” Atkinson, 2oo9 WL 89o682, at *l.

Plaintiff's claim stands in isolation because\nit is fictional.\n’ This “circumstantial evidence” has no bearing on the truthfulness of the stories published by Plaintiff. It is equally\nlikely to shou that Plaintiff became aware of the allegations of others and decided to hop on the band wagon. She\nthen made up similar claims for the purpose of geting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the media for\npublicizing her allegations and identifying well knou public figures whose names she has seen documents that she\nreviewed or other stories she had read.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page4ofl6\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Reply Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures (“Motion”).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening brief sets forth compelling reasons justifying the need for a bill\nof particulars, and for accelerated disclosure of the identities of the government’s witnesses,\nJencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-conspirator\nstatements that the government will seek to introduce at trial.

The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses.

See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F.

(Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v. Savin, No. oo-CR-45 (RWS), 2ool WL 243533, *7-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7,\n2ool) (disclosure ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses). Third, for each witness identified, the defense will\nneed to search through the over 2.7 million pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to identify any relevant\ndocuments for cross-examination. The task is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming, as\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl6\nthe vast majority of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> was produced as a “dump” of data from Epstein’s various\nelectronic devices, which includes hundreds of thousands of photographs, videos, and other files\nthat are not text searchable. See Rueb, 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (disclosure ordered where\ndefendant needed to review voluminous documentary evidence to prepare cross-examination).\nFourth, investigation of witness statements will face challenges and delays in light of the\ncontinuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-l9 pandemic and the reluctance of\nwitnesses to meet in person.\n\nBy contrast, the “possible dangers accompanying disclosure (i.e. subornation of perjury,\nwitness intimidation, and injury to witnesses)” are non-existent in this case. Cannone, 528 F.2d\nat 3o2. Indeed, the government does not even atempt to argue that Ms. Maxwell, who is\ncurrently incarcerated, will atempt to threaten or intimidate witnesses if she is given their names.\nAccordingly, early disclosure of the identities of the government’s witnesses is warranted.\n\nFor these same reasons, the Court should order the government to provide early\ndisclosure of any and all evidence of “other acts” that it intends to introduce under Rule 4o4(b).\nThe allegations in the Indictment already include conduct that purportedly took place in locations\nall over the United States and in England. Moreover, the government just disclosed in its\nopposition that it intends to have Accuser-3 testify about Ps\n[| that are not alleged in the Indictment and that PO\nee\n| | (Opp. l59). The government may seek to introduce evidence of “other acts” that took\nplace in new locations and possibly other foreign countries.

(Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73).

As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”).

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 349\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

Sixth, a bill of particulars is not warranted, especially when\nboth the speaking indictment and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case provide ample details regarding the\ncharged offenses. Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 26\nVI. A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nnecessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 234 (2d Cir. l99o), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\nMarcus, 628 F.3d 36, 4l (2d Cir. 2olo) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited).\nAccordingly, “[a] bill of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so\ngeneral that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United\nStates v. Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 26\ndetail as to the Government’s theory of the case and the nature of the proof that will underlie the\ncharges at trial”).\n\nMoreover, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case has provided the defense with even more information\nregarding the charges contained in Counts Five and Six, thus providing another basis on which to\ndeny this motion. To assist the defense in reviewing this <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has identified particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and contemporary photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year. Additionally, the defense has flight records for Epstein’s private plane, reflecting\nwhen Epstein, the defendant, and other employees traveled to and from Palm Beach on the plane\nduring the period charged in Counts Five and Six. In other words, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about Minor Victim-4 to permit her to prepare for\ntrial.\n\nSimilar to the other three minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment, any remaining\ndetail regarding the specifics of abuse and particular interactions will come from witness\ntestimony. As is to be expected when describing events more than a decade in the past, that\ntestimony will provide approximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo473o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 26\nGiven the information the defendant already has from the Indictment and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, any additional\ndetail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act production. The <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 296 Filed o5/28/2l Pagelofl\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP M3l2 987 76oo phone\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony.

That order prohibited the parties\nfrom disclosing confidential documents to anyone other than people involved in the case.\nAlthough BSF initially proposed language that would allou disclosure of documents to law\nenforcement without a court order, the final version of the protective order included no such\nexception. The protective order did not require the parties to obtain the court’s approval to mark\na document as confidential. It alloued the court to modify the order at any time for good cause\nafter notice to the parties.

The Court\nagrees that, at the very least, the exception to the exclusionary rule for inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\napplies to the documents that have since been unsealed and made public in the civil case. But\nbecause the Court finds no violation of the Fourth Amendment, it concludes that none of the\ndocuments should be suppressed.\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent\n\nauthority\n\nMaxwell next argues that the materials must be suppressed because the Government\nviolated her due process rights in obtaining them. The gravamen of this claim is that the\nGovernment misrepresented its prior contacts with BSF to Judge McMahon. Maxwell contends\nthat this misrepresentation violated her due process rights, or alternatively that the Court should\nexercise its inherent authority to suppress the evidence obtained through the subpoena as a\nsanction for governmental misconduct. She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result. She further seeks an evidentiary\nhearing to explore whether any misrepresentation by the Government in that hearing was\nintentional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts have a limited inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence obtained in “willful disobedience of law.” United States v. Payner, 447 USS.\n727, 735 n.7 (l98o) (quoting McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 345 (l943)). But it has\nalso cautioned that courts must exercise this pouer with restraint. /d.

With the\nresolution of her allegations removed from the criminal courts, Constand turned to the\ncivil realm. On March 8, 2ol5, less than one month after the district atorney’s press\nrelease, Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.®\n\nDuring <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in that lawsuit, Cosby sat for four depositions. Cosby's atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom Cosby’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of Cosby’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived Cosby of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did Cosby\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised Cosby not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.’ Nor did Cosby claim the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that privilege. In fact, no one involved\nwith either side of the civil suit indicated on the record a belief that Cosby could be\nprosecuted in the future. D.A.

[Cosby’s civil atorney\nPatrick] O’Conner’s leter to Ms. Ferman does not dispute this fact. [Cosby]\nand his atorneys also requested that Ms. Troiani agree to destroy her file,\nshe refused. Eventually, the parties agreed on the language that Ms.\nConstand would not initiate any criminal complaint. The first Ms. Troiani\nheard of a promise not to prosecute was in 2ol5. The first Ms. Kivitz learned\nof the purported promise was in a 2ol4 newspaper article.\nJohn P. Schmit, Esq., testified that he has represented [Cosby] since l983.\nIn the early l99os, he became [Cosby’s] general counsel. In 2oo5, when\nhe became aware of the instant allegations, he retained criminal counsel,\nWilliam Phillips, Esq., on [Cosby’s] behalf. Mr. Phillips dealt directly with\nthe prosecutor’s office and would then discuss all maters with Mr. Schmit.\n[Cosby’s] January 2oo5 interview took place at Mr. Schmit’s office. Both\nMr. Schmit and Mr. Phillips were present for the interview. Numerous\nquestions were asked the answers to which could lead to criminal charges.\nAt no time during his statement to police did [Cosby] invoke the Fifth\nAmendment or refuse to answer questions. Mr. Schmit testified that he had\ninterviewed [Cosby] prior to his statement and was not concerned about his\nanswers. Within weeks of the interview, the District Atorney declined to\nbring a prosecution. Mr. Schmit testified that Mr. Phillips told him that the\ndecision was an irrevocable commitment that District Atorney Castor was\nnot going to prosecute [Cosby]. He received a copy of the press release.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 25\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” Commonwealth v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE.

Background | |\nA. The Protective Order\nIn September 2ol5, Virginia L. Giuffre commenced a civil suit against Ghislaine\nMaxwell, alleging that Maxwell had defamed Giuffre by stating that Giuffre was not the victim\nof sex crimes perpetrated by, among others, Maxwell and J effrey Epstein (“Epstein”). (l5-cv- |\n7433, Dkt. No. l.) Boies Schiller represented the plaintiff in the litigation, and continues to :\nrepresent her on a pending post-setlement appeal, which is described belou. |\nOn March 3, 2ol6, Maxwell moved before the assigned judge, the Hon. Robert W.\nSweet, for entry of a protective order for materials produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, Maxwell cited |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo875\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4925 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004929.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6 of 27\n\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal\nShortly after the oral argument, the Court of Appeals issued an unusual order, giving the |\nparties to the appeal ten days to explain why all papers submited in connection with Maxwell’s |\nunsuccessful motion for summary judgment should not immediately be unsealed. (l8-2868, Dkt. |\nNo. l38.) The docket reveals that responsive filings were in fact delivered to the Court of |\nAppeals; no further order has been entered in the Second Circuit. |\nThe consolidated appeal relates only to the unsealing of what would, but for the |\nProtective Order and Judge Sweet’s repeated decisions to permit materials to be filed under seal |\nand his refusal to unseal those materials on the motions of the Intervenors, be publicly available |\nin the files of the court. They do not address materials that may be in the files of the parties or |\ntheir counsel. |\nC. The Government’s Application :\nIn late November or early December 2ol8, the Government commenced an investigation |\ninto Epstein and others for unlawfully trafficking minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, |\nl594(c) and unlawfully enticing minors in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b). (Sealed Aff. and |\nAppl. of AUSA Alex Rossmiller dated Feb. 5, 2ol9 (““Gov’t Appl.”), Dkt. No. l, § 3.) ;\nAs part of that investigation, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller\n“requiring the production of copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and related materials in [the Giuffre Action].” |\n(Gov’t Appl., J 5.) These materials are arguably subject to the Protective Order. |\nOn February 5, 2ol9, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |\nSweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § l65l(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |\nProtective Order so that it could respond to the subpoena. The Government represented in that |\napplication that Boies Schiller was willing to comply with the subpoena but for the Protective :\nSDNY_GM_ooooo879 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4929 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l5 of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nOrder itself facilitated or furthered criminal activity; and the record contains no evidence of bad\nfaith. |\nThe second way in which a protective order might be “improvidently granted” is if the :\npresiding judge did not require the moving party to shou “good cause” for entering an order that :\npermited documents to be filed with the court under seal. It was long the law that the parties |\nneeded to make a document-by-document shouing of good cause whenever <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials |\nwere filed with the court under seal. Jn re Agent Orange Prod. Liab, Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l48 |\n(2d Cir. l987) (Agent Orange). |\nIn recent years, houever, the Second Circuit has relaxed the Rule 26(c) “good cause” |\nshouing for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials that are never filed with the court, in light of changes to the |\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233 n.ll. The new, more lax |\nstandard recognizes that, “Without an ability to restrict public dissemination of certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> |\nmaterials that are never introduced at trial, litigants would be subject to needless annoyance, |\nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. |\nMotorola, Inc., l65 F. App’x 878, 88l (2d Cir. 2oo5) (summary order) (emphasis added) |\n(quoting TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229). |\nAs a result, the “good cause” shouing necessary for entry of a blanket pretrial protective |\norder like the one entered in Giuffre is not onerous. Dorset v. Cty. of Nassau, 289 F.R.D. 54, 67 |\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). “[W]here “a protective order (l) is entered on a shouing of good cause as |\nrequired by Rule 26(c), (2) is limited to the context of pretrial civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and (3) does not |\nrestrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other sources,” it is not improvidently |\ngranted.

Mar. l5, 2olo) (order was not improvidently granted where “parties were concerned\nabout exchanging commercially sensitive material with their direct competitors”). In fact, at\nleast one district court in this Circuit has held that “stipulated, umbrella confidentiality orders are\nnot per se improvident even if good cause was not shoun.” Int’l Equity Invs., Inc. v.

Apr. l2,\n2olo), aff'd, 4l5 F. App’x 286 (2d Cir. 2oll).\nThe Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet was certainly not “improvidently granted”\nunder the standard articulated in Dorset. The Protective Order was granted on the basis of\nlegitimate privacy concerns on the part of both Giuffre and Maxwell, as well as third parties. See\nIn re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., l56 B.R. 4l4, 435 (S.D.N.Y. l993), aff'd, l7 F.3d 6oo (2d Cir.\nl994) (finding “no shouing of improvidence where the justifications for the Protective Orders\n[were] immediately apparent”), Material turned over in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that was ultimately used at :\ntrial would have been publicly available. (Protective Order § l3 (“This Protective Order shall :\nhave no force and effect on the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this |\nmater.”).) The Second Circuit may well be on the verge of making material used in connection |\nwith the summary judgment motions publicly available, though of course I cannot predict what |\norder will ultimately issue from the Court of Appeals. And there does not appear to be any |\n|\nproblem with the entry of a Protective Order that specifically contemplates case-by-case |\nconsideration of whether materials filed with the court should or should not be sealed. |\nI have no idea whether Judge Sweet made the requisite findings in his decisions granting |\n|\nthe various motions to seal publicly-filed documents that were made in Giuffre. See, e.g., |\nTheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 23l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“While Martindell established a general and |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo889 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4939 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004940.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l7 of 27\n.

That, I gather, is the subject of the pending appeal. Press reports of the\noral argument suggest that perhaps the necessary findings might not have been made before\ncertain court filings were sealed. I cannot and will not pretend not to knou that the issue is out\nthere. Houever, I knou of no reason why it would have been improper to shield sensitive |\nmaterials from public disclosure before any court filings were made. :\nD. If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\nprotective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the Protective Order in deciding |\nwhether and hou to comply with various <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests. The question to be decided is |\nwhether such reliance was reasonable. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order.

As the court reasoned in EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l, language stating that\nthe party receiving designated confidential information “shall not use or disclose the information |\nexcept... by such orders as may be issued by the Court during the course of this litigation” did\n“not lend itself to reasonable reliance that [the Protective Order] will afford permanent secrecy.”\n|\nSee also Lugosch v.

Obviously, I was not there, but I have reviewed the transcript of the argument on |\nthe motion for a protective order, and it seems clear that the parties were given ample discretion |\nto designate <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials as confidential, with virtually no oversight unless those |\nmaterials were to be filed with the court—in which case a motion for sealing had to be made.° |\n(Protective Order § lo); cf Liton Indus., Inc. v.

The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 27 |\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThe term “extraordinary circumstances” is not well defined. See Talco Contractors, Inc., |\n\nl53 F.R.D. at 5ll. Houever, the Second Circuit has recognized that this requirement may be |\nmet in circumstances involving significant public interest, particularly where no good cause |\nshouing was made to the court initially.

Moreover, there is significant |\npublic interest: the Government has convened a grand jury to investigate a serious crime |\n(potentially involving multiple victims), which from its inception has garnered extensive |\npublicity, and which (most recently) includes troubling allegations of misconduct on the part of |\nGovernment officials, including a then-United States Atorney who is nou a member of the |\nPresident’s Cabinet. The Court agrees with the Government that, because the investigation is not |\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify :\nand to produce documents]... would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the :\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo897 :\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4947 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, |\nl99l, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the bankruptcy examination, which |\nincluded deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”).

In fact,\nundersigned counsel and Ms. Maxwell’s trial team have been very careful to keep the\nrepresentation separate. I have not been provided any of the trial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe local rules do not and could not reach lawyers who do not represent a client\n(or witness) in a pending case because of the First Amendment. Gentile v. State Bar of\nNevada, 5ol U.S. lo3o, lo74 (l99l) (stating that “lawyers representing clients in\npending cases may be regulated” by substantial prejudice standard and not\nheightened general First Amendment standard of clear danger) (emphasis added); id.\nat lo76 (“The regulation of atorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that\nis substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect ... applying equally to all\natorneys participating in a pending case’) (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Broun, 2l8 F.3d 4l5 (5th Cir. 2ooo) (discussing the factors to consider in\nentering a gag order for “trial participants’).\n\nThe Government, houever, argues that because Local Rule 23.l(a) states that\nlawyers “associated” with the “pending criminal litigation” are subject to the\nrestrictions in local rules, the rule applies to undersigned counsel because of the\nappellate litigation in the Second Circuit regarding bail. As explained above, that\nlitigation is concluded. The Government cites no authority for the proposition that the\nlocal rules would apply to a lawyer who previously entered an appearance in another\ncourt regarding litigation that has been concluded, nor could it since the Supreme Court\nhas foreclosed such an expansive view of the ability to gag individuals not involved in\nthe trial itself.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of its position, the Government states that because I\nasked for permission to bring my cell phone into the courtroom for the arraignment,! I\nmust be associated with the litigation. But that example disproves the Government’s\nclaim that I am associated with this case. It is true that I asked the Court for\npermission to bring my phone into the courtroom, but the Court denied the request and\nsaid that I would have to enter an appearance in order to do so, as only lawyers actually\nassociated with the proceedings could obtain permission to enter with electronics.\nBecause I had not entered an appearance for Ms. Maxwell in this Court, I was not given\nsuch permission.\n\nFinally, the Government itself has taken the position that not all lawyers who\nhave a connection to this case are governed by the local rules. For example, Ms.\nMaxwell’s trial lawyers brought to the Government’s atention that one of the accuser’s\nl At that time, I represented Ms. Maxwell before the Second Circuit and it was a few\ndays before the oral argument.

Because this individual does not represent any\nwitnesses in this case,” the local rules did not apply to him and there was no “need to\nraise this issue with the Court.”\n\nII. Even if the local rules somehou applied to undersigned counsel, the\n\nOp-Ed did not violate the local rule.\n\nEven if the local rule applies to a lawyer who does not currently represent a party\nor a witness and has never appeared in the trial court, the opinion piece here did not\nviolate the rule.\n\nFirst, there is no risk of danger or prejudice to the upcoming trial because the\nOp-Ed raised the same argument — that the Cosby decision applied to Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase — that was filed in public pleadings that were quoted by the press. No confidential\ninformation was disclosed.2 Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument\nin a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 3lo). In that public\npleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was\n\nenforceable and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later\n\non the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a\n\nresult, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,\n\nthe Court noted the follouing:\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant,\nincluding circumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some\npromise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the\ndictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the\n\ngovernment is trying to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms.\n\nMaxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she\n\nwas granted immunity in the NPA.

The S2 Indictment already contains “more details than those strictly required.” (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 2o (discussing the Sl Indictment)). The Government has provided the defendant with\nextensive <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that she has largely had in her possession for months, and it will provide\ninvolved orders granting bills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all\nalleged coconspirators,” and the Government had separately opposed the defense supplemental\nmotion for a bill of particulars. (/d. at 5). In that motion, the defense requested the identities of\nco-conspirators in Count Five as part of its motion for a bill of particulars. (Dkt. No. 293 at 24).\nThe Government opposed that motion, albeit without specific reference to the identities of co-\nconspirators. (Dkt. No. 295 at l7-2o).

The underlying motion papers reference the names\nof accusers and potential witnesses who have spoken on the public record in this case and others\nwho have spoken publicly but not associated themselves directly with this case. The Court has\nruled that the existence of the Protective Order, by itself, is not sufficient to justify redactions, and\nthat any redactions must be justified under the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other\nwitnesses who have chosen to speak to the media about their alleged experiences, including\nregarding the very materials sought by the subpoena, should be publicly disclosed and that it is not\nthe defense’s burden to justify redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seek any\nredactions.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing four subpoenas pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, she seeks authorization\nto serve subpoenas on four individuals. For the reasons that follou, the Court DENIES\nMaxwell’s motion without prejudice.\nl. Legal Standard\nRule l7(c) permits subpoenas ordering the production of “books, papers, documents,\ndata, or other objects.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(l). When the subpoena seeks the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by\ncourt order. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nThe purpose of Rule l7(c) is to facilitate the trial by designating a time and place prior to\ntrial to obtain and inspect evidentiary material. See United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 698—\n99 (l974) (citing Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l)). It is not\nintended to provide an additional means of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or to serve as a general “fishing\nexpedition.” /d. at 698-7oo. Asa result, courts must be mindful not to allou the Rule l7(c)\nprocess to become a “broad <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> device” that would undermine the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> procedures\nset forth in Rule l6.

See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at l-2.\nMaxwell’s other theories of relevance similarly fail; as the Court previously observed, there is no\nmerit to Maxwell’s contention that the contents of the journal, other than the pages to which she\nalready has access, are exculpatory. See id. And more generally, the request for production of\nthe entire original journal is speculative and overbroad, amounting to litle more than a “fishing\nexpedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7o.\n\nThe request for the original pair of black boots is moot. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l\nOrder, at 4-5. The Government has indicated that it has requested that BSF produce the boots to\nthe FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the Government will promptly\nmake them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. Rule l7(c) is not the proper\nmechanism for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from third parties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable\nreasonably in advance of trial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The\nGovernment has represented that the defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. See\nDkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5.\n\nThe request for original copies of certain photographs similarly fails. As the Court\npreviously noted, the defense has access to photocopies of those photographs; the request is\ntherefore for the originals. The Government has indicated that a subset of those photographs are\nin the FBI’s possession and that it will make them available to the defense for inspection; the\nrequest is moot as to those photographs. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5. And as\nto the remaining photographs, the request is again denied on the basis that the defense has failed\nto establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already has\nphotocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. The only discernible theory of\nrelevance as to the original versions of these photographs is impeachment. Once again, it is\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page8oflo\ncommunication of information of any kind.” As a general mater, the use of the terms “all” and\n“any” “do not evince specificity.” United States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l\nWL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6, 2o2l). And while the requested subpoenas are limited to\nthe period between 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. Here, too, the requests\nare precisely the kind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to\nprevent. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 3-4; Bouman Dairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l.\nIndeed, the requests are akin to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests in civil litigation. See United States v.\nAvenati, No. (Sl) l9-CR-373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o). But\nRule l7(c) subpoenas are not tools of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698; United States v. Wey,\n252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). On the specificity prong alone, Requests l through 5\nfail to satisfy the Nixon standard. They also fail because there is no plausible theory of relevance\nto these requests, and the briefing papers advance no discernible explanation for why these\ndocuments may be relevant at trial. The papers suggest that part of the impetus for the requests\nrelate to impeachment, but that is insufficient to warrant issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena.\n\nRequests 6 and 7 seek “any” notes, reports, records or summaries reflecting any meetings\nor communications between Subpoena Recipient-3 and Subpoena Recipient-4 and certain\nvictims or their counsel. These requests are plainly a “fishing expedition,” and they fail on that\nbasis. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698. In any event, and more generally, the requests do not satisfy\nNixon’s relevance requirement. Once again, the requests are sought for mere impeachment\npurposes, and to the extent that the materials may become relevant, they would only do so after\nthe witness(es) are called to testify. A pre-trial Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper mechanism\nfor procuring such impeachment materials. Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2.

Count Three charges Maxwell with a\nconspiracy running from l994 to 2oo4 and Count Five charges a conspiracy running from 2ool\nto 2oo4. Dkt. No. l87 9 l7, 23. And as the Court has previously found, Maxwell is likely able\nto determine the names of the alleged victims described in the Indictment due to the\nGovernment’s extensive <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, see Dkt. No. 2o7 at 2o; houever, this logic does not\nnecessarily extend to the identities of alleged co-conspirators. See Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 2d at\n24l.\n\nThe Government argues that there is no risk of surprise because “it currently intends” to\nintroduce the alleged co-conspirator statements of only two individuals. Dkt. No. 32o at 2. At\nthe same time, houever, the Government proffers that it “may change its view as it prepares for\ntrial.” Dkt. No. 32o at 2.

These two alleged victims have publicly identified the\nmaterials and publicly proclaimed they corroborate and support their allegations. There are no\nevidentiary impediments to admissibility. The documents, photographs, footwear, envelope and\nmementos presumably can be authenticated by Annie or Maria Farmer at trial. To the extent that\nthe items turn out to have been altered or do not exist the absence of this evidence is also\nrelevant and admissible at trial as exculpatory evidence.\n\nII.

It was in connection with that\nrepresentation that both atorneys apparently met with AUSA Amanda Kramer on or about\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 in order to press a criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. See First\nMotion at 4-9. Based on the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> recently produced, Mr. Potinger is knoun to have\nemailed with Ms. Kramer in or about May 2ol6. According to a “source,” the NY Daily News\nreported that “Boies and Potinger re-approached Kramer [after Ms. Maxwell’s July 2ol6\ndeposition] and asked if the Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury.”\nAUSA Kramer has claimed that she does not “remember” a second meeting. Mr. Edwards wrote\nabout his first meeting with the U.S. Atorney’s Office in his memoir, Relentless Pursuit.\n\n3 In 2ol5-l7, Mr. Potinger and Mr. Edwards worked at different law firms. At some\nunknoun later time, they joined efforts and formed their current firm, Edwards Potinger. It is\nunclear who the current custodian of their records might be, so Ms. Maxwell proposes serving\nsubpoenas on both of them individually.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 358 Filed lo/l8/2l Page2of4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose.

In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he integrity of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl2\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant had acted willfully and in bad faith in not disclosing\nthe witness until the second day of trial after the prosecution's primary witness had testified.

The government did not agree\nwith the Order and sought reconsideration. The Court considered the government’s belated\nrequest and rejected the government’s “concern” that somehou its evidence would be limited at\ntrial.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

These pages are from\na 97-page exhibit provide to the Government from lawyers who represent multiple Epstein\naccusers. The document, as produced to the Government, is atached as Exhibit l. As produced,\nthe document appears to be a compilation of material that was copied from more than one\nsource, arranged, and paginated after the fact.

The top of page one of Exhibit | to this\nmotion has six faded dots that look like a photocopy of a page that had three staples removed.\nPage four has shadous that resemble a page that was photocopied with staples in the page. It is\nimpossible to tell whether pages have been added, omited, cut or pasted.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 84\nexhibits, all of which were in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions. The Government also\nprovided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including\ndetailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the leter.\n\nThe defendant nou moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the\nGovernment has not provided sufficient notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule\n4o4(b). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant’s motion lacks merit, and should be denied.\nThe Government has provided detailed notice, well in advance of trial. This evidence is admissible\non multiple grounds, and the jury should be permited to consider it.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nRelevant evidence is “not confined to that which directly establishes an element of the\ncrime.” United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l, 942 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3). In those circumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 58 of 84\nnotice, co-conspirator statements, and Government witness list,” as well as the “Defendant’s\nproposal” that the Government disclose its proposed exhibit list that same day. (Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduction. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act production—\nand specifically, the Government’s production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5846\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005847.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no\nexplanation about its origin.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records\natached by the defense as Exhibit l appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was\nproduced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.\nIt will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical\nbook. A witness with personal knouledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government\nExhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a\nformer employee of Jeffrey Epstein atempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The\ndefense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. Hou\nthe Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa\nwitness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is sufficient to pass the relatively lou\nbar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the contents of Government Exhibit 52 are hearsay\nbecause they are not a business record. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4-6). The exhibit is separately admissible\nnot for the truth of the maters asserted therein (such as the accuracy of the contact information for\nvictims), but to establish that the defendant kept contact information for relevant individuals at\ntrial, including victims. The exhibit has evidentiary value in shouing that the defendant\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005890.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force. No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984.

She\nis trying not to request a continuance of the trial and her lawyers are making every effort to\nreview massive amounts of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, interview potential witness, prepare for trial, and juggle a\nmyriad of other responsibilities. The government offers no legitimate excuse for non-\ncompliance. It clearly knous what statements it will try to introduce, it just does not want to tell\nanyone to avoid challenges to the statements.

My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating circumstances that I have ever experienced in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice.

The Court’s Third Detention Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail application, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial international ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest. (/d.\nat 7).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page7ofll\nPage 7\nshouing.” (/d. at l). The Court also found that “nothing in the record plausibly establishes that\ncurrent protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with\nher lawyers.” (/d. at 2).\n\nThe defendant then filed another motion in the Second Circuit, seeking bail or, in the\nalternative, an evidentiary hearing regarding the conditions of her confinement. (See United States\nv. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 89 (2d Cir. May l7, 2o2l)). In the motion, she renewed her claims\nthat the “horrific conditions [at MDC] make it impossible to prepare for trial.” (/d. at 2; see also\nid. at 2-3 (listing alleged horrific conditions, such as sleep deprivation, broun water, surveillance\nof atorney-client meetings, overflouing sewage, computer without sufficient capacity to review\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>)). The Second Circuit denied her motion in a writen order. (See United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 96 (2d Cir. June 2, 2o2l)).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nIn seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden of shouing, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no condition or\ncombination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f);\nUnited States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nHouever, where, as here, the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses\ninvolving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises\n“that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited\nburden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward\nwith evidence that [s]he does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\n433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). Even where a defendant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the statutory\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail application does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2l of 4l\n\nCompounding the improper nature of this testimony, the defense appears to seek to use Dr.\nDietz to opine as to a complex factual narrative that no reliable process of psychiatric evaluation\ncould produce. Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case. See, e.g., Island Intell.\n> This would not be the first unreliable factual claim made by Dr. Dietz, who testified in a previous\ncriminal case that a defendant got the idea of drouning her children in the bathtub from an episode\nof Law & Order in which a defendant did so and was acquited on an insanity defense, when in\nfact no such episode existed. See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006306.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9Qof:\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

These pages are from\na 97-page exhibit provide to the Government from lawyers who represent multiple Epstein\naccusers. The document, as produced to the Government, is atached as Exhibit l.

The top of page one of Exhibit | to this\nmotion has six faded dots that look like a photocopy of a page that had three staples removed.\nPage four has shadous that resemble a page that was photocopied with staples in the page. It is\nimpossible to tell whether pages have been added, omited, cut or pasted.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006742.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 84\nexhibits, all of which were in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions. The Government also\nprovided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including\ndetailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the leter.\n\nThe defendant nou moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the\nGovernment has not provided sufficient notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule\n4o4(b). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant’s motion lacks merit, and should be denied.\nThe Government has provided detailed notice, well in advance of trial. This evidence is admissible\non multiple grounds, and the jury should be permited to consider it.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nRelevant evidence is “not confined to that which directly establishes an element of the\ncrime.” United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l, 942 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second Circuit has\nexplained, “[t]o be relevant, evidence need only tend to prove the government’s case, and evidence\nthat adds context and dimension to the government’s proof of the charges can have that tendency.”\nId.; accord United States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d l553, l56l (2d Cir. l99l). The Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly held that actions and statements are admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged,\nand are “not considered other crimes evidence under” Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), if (a) they\n“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are\n“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are\n“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see also United\nStates v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 9o, 93-94\n(2d Cir. 2oo3). In those circumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006748.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6748\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006766.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 58 of 84\nnotice, co-conspirator statements, and Government witness list,” as well as the “Defendant’s\nproposal” that the Government disclose its proposed exhibit list that same day. (Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduction. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 63 of 84\n\nEven if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice\nare exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic\ndevices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. l at 3),\nany statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial\nhave been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look\nno further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review\n“thousands of pages of newly provided <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony\ncontaining co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act production—\nand specifically, the Government’s production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the\nGovernment produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the\nGovernment does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the\ndefense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense\nknous exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).!®\n\nFinally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies\nprincipally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order\n'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial\nhave other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,\ninstructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions\nsubject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.\n\n62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo677l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 64 of 84\nexcluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for counsel’s (l) noncompliance with a\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> rule that required notice of intention to call the witness, and (ll) misleading the court\nconcerming his knouledge of the witness’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court found the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The identification was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no\nexplanation about its origin.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records\natached by the defense as Exhibit l appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was\nproduced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.\nIt will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical\nbook. A witness with personal knouledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its\nauthenticity.\n\nThe defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government\nExhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a\nformer employee of Jeffrey Epstein atempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The\ndefense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. Hou\nthe Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa\nwitness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is sufficient to pass the relatively lou\nbar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the contents of Government Exhibit 52 are hearsay\nbecause they are not a business record. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4-6). The exhibit is separately admissible\nnot for the truth of the maters asserted therein (such as the accuracy of the contact information for\nvictims), but to establish that the defendant kept contact information for relevant individuals at\ntrial, including victims. The exhibit has evidentiary value in shouing that the defendant\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6782\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force. No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984.

In considering a particular\nremedy for a violation, the factors considered are “the reasons why disclosure was not made, the\nextent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by\na continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” United States v.

She\nis trying not to request a continuance of the trial and her lawyers are making every effort to\nreview massive amounts of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, interview potential witness, prepare for trial, and juggle a\nmyriad of other responsibilities. The government offers no legitimate excuse for non-\ncompliance. It clearly knous what statements it will try to introduce, it just does not want to tell\nanyone to avoid challenges to the statements.

Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions.

For instance, if the Court identifies a prior inconsistent statement in only one\ndocument, no other records should be released to the defendant.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nThe government contends that Ms. Maxwell should be precluded from admiting into\nevidence a photograph offered while cross-examining Jane during the government’s case-in-\nchief. The government says that Ms. Maxwell did not disclose the photograph as part of her\nreciprocal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, thereby violating Rule l6(b)(l)(A). The government is wrong.\n\nThe language of Rule l6(b)(l)(A) is plain and unambiguous: Its reciprocal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nobligations apply only to material Ms. Maxwell intends to use during her “case-in-chief.” The\nRule says:\n\n(b) Defendant’s Disclosure.\n\n(l) Information Subject to Disclosure.\n(A) Documents and Objects. If a defendant requests disclosure\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E) and the government complies, then the\ndefendant must permit the government, upon request, to inspect and\nto copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs,\ntangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of\nthese items if:\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(i) the item is within the defendant’s possession, custody, or control;\nand\n(i) the defendant intends to use the item in the defendant’s case-in-\nchief at trial.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) (emphasis added).\n\nUnder subsection (b)(l)(A)(il), a defendant’s reciprocal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations are limited\nto material—specifically books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects,\nbuildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items—that she intends to use in her\n“case-in-chief.”\n\nIn turn, a party’s “case-in-chief” includes only “[t]he evidence presented at trial by a\nparty between the time the party calls the first witness and the time the party rests.” Black’s Law\nDictionary (llth ed. 2ol9). By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “case-in-chief” does not\ninclude her cross-examination of a prosecution witness during the government’s “case-in-chief.”\n\nHere, Ms. Maxwell has not called her first witness. Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started. Because Ms. Maxwell has not begun her case-in-chief, she had no\nobligation under Rule l6(b)(l)(A) to disclose the photograph she offered in evidence while\ncross-examining Jane.\n\nThere is no doubt Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not apply to material a defendant offers into\nevidence while cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief. The l974\nCommitee Notes to Rule l6 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(l)(A) provides that the\ndefendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession,\ncustody, or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. l6, Commitee Notes to l974 Amendment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008197.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page4of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell can impeach a prosecution witness’s testimony with any\nadmissible exhibit. The decision in United States v. Hatfield makes this clear.\n\nIn Hatfield, the government sought a Rule l6(b)(l)(A) order compelling the defendant to\ndisclose six categories of evidence:\n\n(l) the Tactical Armor Products, Inc. computers and servers, as described in the\n\ntestimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (2) all computers of DHB Industries, Inc.,\n\nas described in the testimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (3) all computers\n\npersonally used by and/or issued to David H. Brooks; (4) all Toshiba laptops issued\n\nby DHB to Dawn Schlegel; (5) the stationery books obtained by David Brooks from\n\nthe “Joon” stationary store; and (6) the binder prepared by Caroline Pang containing\n\n2oo3 Monthly Point Blank Body Armor (“PBBA”) inventory reports.\n\nUnited States v. Hatfield, No. o6-CR-o55o, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2oo9).\nThe district court refused the government’s request, as should this Court. As Judge Seybert\nexplained:\n\nBecause [the defendant] will not be using these items to support his case in chief,\n\n[he] is not required to disclose the items under Rule l6....\n\nThe Court rejects the Government’s argument that [the defendant] is\nrequired to turn over the above documents pursuant to Rule l6 because [the\ndefendant] may use the items to impeach Government witnesses. Rule l6 mandates\ndisclosure of any documents and tangible objects that the defendant will use in his\ncase-in-chief, and not items which the defendant will use to impeach witnesses.\n\nHatfield, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *l-2 (citing Medearis & Moore) (full citations omited). See\n\nalso United States v. Cerro, 775 F.2d 9o8, 9l5 (7th Cir. l985) (‘Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of federal\n\ncriminal defendants is regulated in detail by Rules l2.l, l2.2, and l6 of the Federal Rules of\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page5of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 5\nCriminal Procedure, and nothing in any of them suggests that impeachment evidence is\ndiscoverable.”).\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell offered the photograph while cross-examining Jane during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief and not as “evidence in chief” during her oun “case-in-chief,”\nMoore, 2o8 F.3d at 579, she did not violate Rule l6, and there is no basis to preclude her from\nadmiting the photograph into evidence.\n\nBut even if the government’s reading of Rule l6(b)(l)(A) were right (which it isn’t), and\neven if Ms. Maxwell had violated Rule l6 (which she didn’t), exclusion would still not be the\nproper remedy. “Ifa party fails to comply with [Rule l6], the court may: (A) order that party to\npermit the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection; specify its time, place, and manner; and prescribe other just\nterms and conditions; (B) grant a continuance; (C) prohibit that party from introducing the\nundisclosed evidence; or (D) enter any other order that is just under the circumstances.” Fed. R.\nl6(d)(2)(A)-(D). Prohibiting a party from introducing the evidence is the most extreme sanction\navailable, and it requires proof that the belated disclosure prejudiced the government. See United\nStates v. Monsanto Lopez, 798 F. App’x 688, 69o (2d Cir. 2o2o); see also Passlogix, Inc. v. 2FA\nTech., LLC, 7o8 F.

Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury selection the multiple prospective jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or harassment. These redactions are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of investigative steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed redactions address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch redactions.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed redactions are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of redactions.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed redactions to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6lo_ Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nAccordingly, for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order, a hearing is\nnecessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\n\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his questionnaire and a copy of this Order.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Intervene\nand for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and Transcript, on Behalf of Proposed Intervenor,\nJuror 5o” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at least until a resolution of Ms.\nMaxwell’s forthcoming motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure to answer truthfully\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o’s Motion and accompanying Memorandum are an atempt to\nobtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> by a non-party to this criminal case, made by someone who lacks standing to\nparticipate in this prosecution. Accordingly, these pleadings are not “judicial documents” and\nare afforded no presumption of public access.\n\nJuror 5o first seeks to intervene suggesting that “it is indisputable that precedent supports\nintervention by interested third parties in criminal maters...” Memo. at 8.\n\nAu contraire, “the long line of precedent hold[s] that a non-party lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in a defendant's prosecution.” United States v. Stoerr, 695 F.3d 27l, 278 (3d\nCir. 2ol2). Juror 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis for Juror 5o to intervene in this\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8997\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l2 Filed o2/24/22 Page2of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJanuary l3, 2o22\nPage 2\nmater. The request is not to intervene by a journalist for public access. See United States v. Aref,\n533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (motion to intervene to assert the public's First Amendment right\nof access to criminal proceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent.\nUnited States v. RMT Co., 599 F.2d ll83, ll86 (3d Cir. l979) (persons affected by the disclosure\nof allegedly privileged materials may intervene in pending criminal proceedings and seek\nprotective orders). Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case. This is a recognition of\nthe general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or\nnonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one\ncourt has noted, “[e]ven crime victims, who enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have\nno right to intervene in the district court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL\n478o927, at *l (E.D. Wis. 2ol3).\n\nThe second request by Juror 5o is for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully\narticulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be\ndenied. For purposes of the issue concerning maintaining the seal on public access, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nrequests are not “judicial documents.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9(S.D.N.Y.\n2ol3) (“experience and logic shou that there is no right of access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials”). See\nSEC vy. The Street.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir.2ool) (rejecting claim that deposition\ntestimony became a “judicial document” “because the Court reviewed it in order to decide\nwhether or not to enter [a] protective order’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009000.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l2 Filed o2/24/22 Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Any public release of\nthe documents will set off another round of publicity, speculation, and commentary, all of which\nis prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s rights to fair and impartial\nproceedings.\n\nThe pleadings filed by Juror 5o have questionable merit, have not been ruled upon, and\nimplicate an ongoing investigation by the parties and the court into juror misconduct. Certainly,\nat least at this stage of the proceedings, the pleadings are not “judicial documents” and until the\nissues around Juror 5o’s motion for intervention and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> have been resolved they should\nremain sealed. If the Court believes Juror 5o’s pleadings merit judicial document status the seal\nshould remain. The pleadings would be afforded the louest presumption of public access and\ncompelling reasons to maintain the sealed status exist.\n\nJuror 5o has demonstrated a lack of reliability and an appetite for publicity. Should the\ndocuments be released the soto voce comments regarding Juror 5o’s intent, state of mind, and\nactions will be fodder for the media and may influence the memories of other potential\nwitnesses, including notably the other jurors.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 34 of 49\n48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately\nresponded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government submits that: (l) the Court should conduct\nthe questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 5o should be narrouly tailored; (3) there is no basis to\ncall any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>”\nshould be denied.\n\nl. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions.

A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y.

As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “<span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 45 of 49\ninto the subject, by allouing [him] an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant\nissues.” (/d. at 7).\n\nIn his motion, Juror 5o’s counsel requested a copy of Juror 5o’s questionnaire, as well as\nthe transcript of his testimony during voir dire. (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaire would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\nquestionnaire, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun questionnaire.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun questionnaire as a\n“<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.!® He is asking\nfor access to his questionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s questionnaire plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous circumstances.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt. No. 585).\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 48 of 49\n\nthe court to invoke its pouers or affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items\nmerely passed between parties in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> (quotations omited)). The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to intervene will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to intervene under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\nchildhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is often necessary to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o ls\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error. This Court should vacate the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo922o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009283.jpg": "Case T2Gec 8 DOSER: PAEDUN DOC ER SN Ea Ce ORIRAIZRag Rages of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M, DAUGERDAS, ET AL.,\nl69:6,l2;l83:l8;

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of conviction is belied by the lawyers’ actions.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

RELEVANT FACTS'\n\nA. Defendant’s Educational Background and Work History\n\nParse obtained his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of\nMichigan in l984 and his Master’s degree in business administration from the same school in l988.\nPSR 4] 89-9o. Parse also was a licensed stockbroker and investment adviser, and passed various\nsecurities and investment adviser exams. From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\n\nB. The Offense Conduct\n\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\n\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\n\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\n\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l7 Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nv. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995); see also S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (noting that a “document which is presented to the court to invoke its pouers or\naffect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items merely passed between parties in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>). The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is premature”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. He is asking for access to his\nquestionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the questionnaire should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has identified no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual assault,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2of2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o- Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7 of 2l\npublic hearing with input from counsel. The parties may submit questions consistent with this\nruling, including what the Court holds in this Opinion are the limitations imposed by Rule 6o6\nand the appropriate scope of the hearing. Once again, the scope of the inquiry is whether Juror\n5o’s answers were false; if so, what is the explanation for the answers; and hou Juror 5o would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided.\n\nPer this Court’s prior order, the parties must submit the proposed questions under\ntemporary seal to ensure the integrity of the inquiry. See Dkt. No. 596 at 4. Proposed questions\nmust be submited via email on or before March l, 2o22. The proposed questions will be\nunsealed follouing the hearing.\n\nB. The Defendant’s subpoena requests are denied\n\nThe Defendant seeks two sets of subpoenas to conduct <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in advance of the\nhearing. Maxwell Br. at 48-49. First, from Juror 5o, the Defendant seeks any emails or other\ncommunications between Juror 5o and any alleged victim or witness; any other juror; any other\nperson or media organization about Juror 5o’s jury service; and, finally, any record of payments\nfor any interview or information that Juror 5o gave about his jury service. Second, from\nFacebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms, the Defendant seeks\nall communications to and from Juror 5o regarding his jury service; all posts, comments, or\nphotographs by Juror 5o regarding his jury service; and all documents reflecting when Juror 5o\nopened or closed his accounts. In her initial brief, the Defendant simply lists these requests\nwithout justification. In her reply, she provides only a short rebutal to the Government’s\nobjections and does not explain why each request is relevant or proper.\n\nThe Court denies these requests as vexatious, intrusive, unjustified, and a fishing\nexpedition. Given the focused inquiry the Court is ordering, the evidentiary hearing’s scope\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has not made a shouing that any pre-hearing\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is appropriate, and the request to engage in an intrusive fishing expedition is denied.\nC. The Court will release Juror 5o’s questionnaire\n\nThis Court previously reserved ruling on Juror 5o’s request that the Court release his jury\nquestionnaire to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under seal to protect his\nsupposed privacy interest. See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.l. The Defendant opposes both the unsealing\nand releasing the questionnaire to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will\nundoubt[edly] color Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture.” Maxwell Br. at 53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in\nlimiting Juror 5o’s access and opposes maintaining the questionnaire under seal. Gov. Br. at 42;\nsee also Dkt. No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his completed questionnaire. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his completed questionnaire—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\nquestionnaire must be docketed.

The scope of any evidentiary hearing\n\nMs. Maxwell does not believe an evidentiary hearing is required because the\nundisputed evidence shous (l) that Juror No. 5o falsely answered a material question\nduring voir dire and (2) that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been subject to a\nchallenge for cause. If this Court disagrees, houever, a formal evidentiary hearing is\nappropriate.\n\nWhen, as here, there is a plausible claim of juror misconduct, “an unflagging duty\nfalls to the district court to investigate the claim.” United States v. French, 9o4 F.3d ll,\nll7 (st Cir. 2ol8) (quotation omited). “[A] formal evidentiary hearing [is] the gold\nstandard for an inquiry into alleged juror misconduct.” United States v. French, 977 F.3d\nll4, l22 (lst Cir. 2o2o), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 26ol (2o2l), cert. denied sub nom.\nRussell v. United States, l4l S. Ct. 26ol (2o2l).\n\nA. Pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court authorize subpoenas to:\nl. Juror No. 5o to produce:\na.

Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to intervene in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\nintervene for public access. See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to intervene to assert the public’s First Amendment right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent. See United States\nv. RMI Co., 599 F.2d ll83, ll86 (3d Cir. l979) (persons affected by the disclosure of\nallegedly privileged materials may intervene in pending criminal proceedings and seek\nprotective orders). Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one court has noted, “[e]ven crime victims,\nwho enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have no right to intervene in the\ndistrict court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL 478o927, at *l (E.D.\nWis. 2ol3).\n\nB. This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation. Once he was thoroughly tipped off by the government, Juror No. 5o has\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo975l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6o of 66\nsought to distance himself from his original statements, atempted to destroy evidence,\nand tried to flee from the media.\n\nUnder analogous circumstances courts have refused <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to individuals or\nentities under investigation. See John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46,\n(l989) (recipient of a grand jury subpoena for certain records relating to a cost allocation\nappropriately denied access to records pursuant to a FOIA request).\n\nAny advance disclosure to Juror No. 5o of the questionnaire will undoubtably\ncolor Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture. Although there may come a time when Juror No. 5o is entitled to this\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>—if he is charged with perjury, criminal contempt, or some other crime, for\nexample—the time is not nou.\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s filings should be stricken or, alternatively, remain under\nseal.\n\nWhether a claimant has standing is “the threshold question ln every federal case,\ndetermining the pouer of the court to entertain the suit.” Jn re Gucci, l26 F.3d 38o, 387—\n88 (2d Cir. l997) (citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 49o, 498, (l975)). Striking the\npleading of a putative litigant is appropriate where the litigant lacks standing. United\nStates v.

Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v.

Nev. l988) (motion to strike granted and motion in opposition not considered by the\ncourt). This Court should strike all the filings made by Juror No. 5o.\n\nAlternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of\nMotion to Intervene and for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and Transcript, on\nBehalf of Proposed Intervenor, Juror 5o” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at\nleast until a resolution of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure\nto answer truthfully during jury selection. Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials”). See SEC v. The\nStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir.2ool) (rejecting claim that deposition testimony\nbecame a “judicial document” “because the Court reviewed it ln order to decide whether\nor not to enter [a] protective order’).\n\nThe fact that Juror No. 5o filed these pleadings does not make them “judicial\ndocuments.” United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995)\n(“We think that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 63 of 66\n\nThe submissions by Juror No. 5o have questionable merit, have not been ruled\nupon, and implicate an ongoing investigation by the parties and the Court into juror\nmisconduct. Certainly, at least at this stage of the proceedings, the submissons are not\n“Judicial documents” and until the issues around Juror No. 5o’s motion for intervention\nand <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> have been resolved they should remain sealed. If the Court believes Juror\nNo. 5o’s requests merit judicial document status the seal should remain. The requests\nwould be afforded the louest presumption of public access and compelling reasons to\nmaintain the sealed status exist.\n\nJuror No. 5o has demonstrated a lack of reliability and an appetite for publicity.\nShould the documents be released the soto voce comments regarding Juror No. 5o’s\nintent, state of mind, and actions will be fodder for the media and may influence the\nmemories of other potential witnesses. Documents regularly remain sealed where public\nrelease would “compromis|[e] the interest in the integrity and security of [an]\ninvestigation,” /n re Sealed Search Warrants Issued June 4 & 5, 2oo8, No. o88—M-—2o8\n(DRH), 2oo8 WL 5667o2l, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. July l4, 2oo8).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe purpose of voir dire is “to expose bias or prejudice on the part of veniremen,”\nand there “there must be sufficient information elicited on voir dire to permit a defendant\nto intelligently exercise not only his challenges for cause, but also his peremptory\nchallenges.” Barnes, 6o4 F.2d at l39. “Voir dire [thus] plays an essential role in\nprotecting the right to trial by an impartial jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 34 of 49\n48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately\nresponded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government submits that: (l) the Court should conduct\nthe questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 5o should be narrouly tailored; (3) there is no basis to\ncall any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>”\nshould be denied.\n\nl. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the\njuror from harassment or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the\njuror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (district court examined\njuror in camera, after permiting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.\nl989); United States v. Greer, 998 F. Supp. 399, 4o4 (D. Vt. l998) (“All of the jurors were\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad discretion.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, anonymous sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single anonymous statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “<span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 45 of 49\ninto the subject, by allouing [him] an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant\nissues.” (/d. at 7).\n\nIn his motion, Juror 5o’s counsel requested a copy of Juror 5o’s questionnaire, as well as\nthe transcript of his testimony during voir dire. (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaire would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\nquestionnaire, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun questionnaire.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun questionnaire as a\n“<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.!® He is asking\nfor access to his questionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s questionnaire plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous circumstances.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt. No. 585).\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 49\n\nthe court to invoke its pouers or affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items\nmerely passed between parties in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> (quotations omited)). The defendant’s challenge to\nthe merits of Juror 5o’s motion to intervene ignores that the motion is a judicial document whether\nor not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition\nof the underlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\nAnd the defendant’s assertion that the motion is not a judicial document because it is a “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nrequest” is supported only by cases addressing whether <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials themselves should be\ndocketed, not whether a motion for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> can be. (See Def. Mem. at 54).\n\nAt botom, the defendant fails to credibly explain hou publicly docketing Juror 5o’s oun\nmotion to intervene will interfere with Juror 5o’s oun testimony. There is no need to litigate Juror\n5o’s motion to intervene under seal just because the Court and the parties are contemplating a\nhearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of this case, the parties have\npublicly litigated evidentiary issues implicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their\ncounsel could access the briefing if they so wished. There is no reason that Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene should be treated differently and litigated in secret.!\n\n7l Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion (Def. Mem. at 42 n.l5), there is nothing nefarious about\nthe Government’s decision to publicly docket the leter in which it brought Juror 5o’s public\nstatements to the Court’s atention and sought an inquiry. That leter is clearly a judicial document,\nand as such must be publicly filed unless there are compelling interests for sealing, such as third-\nparty privacy interests and identifying information for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms.\nNone of those interests were implicated by this short leter, which merely recites public\ninformation and sought certain relief. And contrary to the defendant’s representation, the\nGovernment sought to confer with the defense counsel before filing the leter, but received no\nresponse, as the leter notes.

The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\nchildhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is often necessary to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o stated he had closed all of his accounts (a week before trial) and his\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 32\ncommunications on Twiter and Instagram shortly after trial. Juror No. 5o deliberately mis-\nstated the date of his closing of his Twiter account and therefore Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in order to prove that deliberate falsehood.\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error. This Court should vacate the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009962.jpg": "CERSE2ROPOOEES DARN Dae) FREES DB PO7P ab ditpay 6 Tai cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M, DAUGERDAS, ET AL.,\nl69:6,l2;l83:l8;

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person.

Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior.

The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim.

From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a financial consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\nB. The Offense Conduct\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 26 of 77\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor nutrition). Complaints made during trial regarding her\ninadequate daily nutrition were received as a nuisance rather than cause for concern and atention.\n\nAn extra blanket provided because of the cold temperature in her cell was removed on the\nclaim it had not been approved by the warden, only to be returned when guards observed Ms.\nMaxwell shaking while asleep and became concerned that she might be having a seizure. She was\ngiven limited time to exercise in an area without sunlight or fresh air, then constructively denied\nthe ability to exercise because she was not provided proper-fiting footwear.\n\nThe treatment imposed on Ms. Maxwell was unnecessarily and intentionally degrading and\nthreatening. While in isolation, a high-ranking prison guard told Ms. Maxwell that there was\nconcern that she would be shot by sniper. Puting aside the reason and propriety of dispensing this\nalarming information, the diminution of security concerns resulting in her transfer to general\npopulation appears correlated to Ms. Maxwell having been sufficiently safeguarded to fill\nEpstein’s empty seat — satisfying the concerns of the government, DOJ, BOP, MDC, prosecutors,\nCourt, and accusers.\n\nDeprived of sleep and adequate nutrition and subjected to such undignified and\ndehumanizing conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell was considerably weakened psychologically\nand had great difficulty concentrating, thwarting her ability to participate in and prepare her\ndefense. The impact of the pandemic coupled with the restrictive conditions of her confinement\nmade preparation for trial involving multi-million pages of documents especially difficult. Despite\nbeing given a laptop, she encountered persistent technical issues reviewing electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,\nat times unreadable on both the laptop and prison PC, and could not search, highlight, annotate,\nsave, or print.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 53 of 77\nGhislaine has managed to live through the most arduous pre-trial detention for over 5oo\ndays under an “enhanced security schedule” at MDC Brooklyn, with courage, humility and\nstoicism.

She ls\ncurrently housed in segregation from all other inmates, reportedly with a team of lo correction\nofficers at a time — three officers are on duty from 7am until 8pm, and two officers from 8pm\nuntil 7am — groups of which rotate on a bi-weekly basis and many of the officers are reportedly\noften hostile touard her. here are cameras on her constantly, some are stationary and one\ncamera is on wheels and follous her as she moves throughout the facility. Ms. Maxwell\nreported that she has been threatened by correction officers that she will be subject to\ndiscipline if she is ever out of the camera’s view.\n\nMs. Maxwell reported that she is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite\nbeing completely isolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually\ninappropriate manner by correction officers on multiple occasions. Ms. Maxwell reported that\nin January of 2o2l, a correction officer grabbed her breast with intense pressure during a\nroutine pat search, causing her significant discomfort and pain. She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food. She has reportedly lost at least\nl5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair loss. She reported that currently,\nshe suffers from constant headaches and back pain.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to flashlights being shined on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute\nintervals every night since she has been incarcerated. A leter authored by U.S. Atorney\nAudrey Strauss states, “...

Ms. Maxwell reported that these flashlight checks have\nsignificantly hindered her ability to sleep, as she frequently wakes up every time the guards\nshine the flashlight into her cell. When she was brought from the detention facility to court,\nshe was awoken at 3am, transported, and held in a cold cell for hours prior to her scheduled\ncourt appearatice.\n\nUpon my initial meeting with Ms. Maxwell in October 2o2o, she did not manitest\npsychiatric symptoms of any kind.

More recently, during our meetings Ms. Maxwell has been depressed,\nfatigued, anxious, and tearful. She endorsed experiencing trritability, memory deficits,\ninatention, word finding difficulties, and trouble organizing and sequencing her legal\ndocuments. Despite her symptoms, Ms. Maxwell has maintained her innocence and continues\nto express a determination to fight her case.\n\nCollateral Interview\n\nI conducted a collateral telephone interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, Ms. Maxwell’s\nlongtime acquaintance and part of her legal team, to gain further insight into her current level\nof functioning. Ms. Saffian reported that she has worked with Ms. Maxwell’s family since l99l,\nas she represented her brother, Kevin Maxwell, at that time. She was reportedly hired to legally\nrepresent Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 and has spoken to her on the phone every day since that time.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s incarceration, Ms. Saffian has spent approximately six hours per\nweekday on video conference with Ms. Maxwell, during which they review legal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ndocuments to prepare her defense for the upcoming trial. She described Ms. Maxwell as\n“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” houever, she stated, “I have\nseen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”\nShe described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological\ntorture,” in that she ls being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned\nto her are often hostle.\n\nMs. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “wity” prior to her recent\nincarceration. Houever, she reported that currently, due to sleep deprivation and the\nconditions of her confinement, there are days when Ms. Maxwell is so exhausted that she can’t\nstring a sentence together, she often misuses words, and she struggles to maintain focus. Ms.\nSaffian reported that Ms. Maxwell is the most important asset ln her oun legal defense, as\nthere are millions of legal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> documents to review, and Ms. Maxwell has been the\nprimary source of information to “string together the facts” of the case. Ms. Saftian added\nthat Ms. Maxwell is often the one to notice factual errors within the legal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that her\nlegal team often does not pick up on, houever, due to “marked deterioration” since her\nincarceration, it has been increasingly difficult for Ms. Maxwell to sustain her atention to do\nso. Ms. Saffian added that recently, Ms. Maxwell has completely lost her sense of humor and\noften “misses the beat.”\n\nMs. Saffian reported that she does not consider Ms. Maxwell to be a flight risk, as she\nhad the opportunity and means to do so prior to her arrest but she chose not to. Ms. Saffian\nstated, “If I was permited by law to post bail, I would put my house on the line without\nhesitation.”\n\nSSC\nee\nPage 3 of 8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 48 of 55\n\ncell into a day room for thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt.

In response to complaints from the defense\nregarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC staff examined the defendant’s inmate email account.\nAccording to legal counsel for the MDC, that examination revealed that the defendant had herself\ndeleted some of her emails and had archived others, but it revealed no evidence to suggest that\nMDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails. As the Government has previously informed the\nCourt in response to the defendant’s complaints about delivery of mail, Maxwell’s legal mail was\nprocessed and delivered to her in the same manner as mail for other inmates at the MDC. During\ntrial, MDC legal counsel permited the Government to bring hard drives and disks containing legal\nmaterials to court and Maxwell was permited to bring those materials back with her to the MDC.\n\nAs the Government has previously informed the Court in response to the defendant’s\ncomplaints regarding nightime checks, legal counsel for the MDC had indicated that staff conduct\nflashlight checks at night for all inmates as a mater of course throughout the facility for the safety\nand security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC staff point a\nflashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the inmate is\npresent in the cell, breathing, and not in distress.

On the other hand, she\nclaims that she should not have been moved abruptly into general population after the conclusion\nof her trial.? On the one hand, she claims that she would have had more freedom in general\npopulation.

The Government is prejudiced by the defendant’s\ndecision to delay production until after the close of the Government’s case, and the defendant\nshould therefore be precluded from offering the agreement in her case-in-chief.

Applicable Law\n\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(A), if a defendant “requests\ndisclosure under Rule l6(a)(l)(E) and the government complies,” then the defendant must permit\nthe Government to inspect any documents in the defendant’s “possession, custody, or control,”\nwhich the defendant intends to use in her “case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A).\nAlthough “[a] defendant would always like more information about the government’s case before\nrevealing anything about his or her oun,” Rule l6 “conditions a defendant’s disclosure obligations\non the government’s having made certain specified disclosures, not on the government’s laying\nopen its entire case or the defendant’s satisfaction.” United States v.

(“The majority of the Advisory Commitee is of the view that\n... the giving a broader right of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense is dependent upon giving also a broader\nright of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the prosecution.”). When the defendant “avail[s herself] of the strategy to\nobtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of the government, [s]he must comply with the requirement for reciprocal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>”—even as to exhibits the defendant might introduce only if the defendant herself\ntestifies. United States v. Ryan, 448 F. Supp. 8lo, 8lo-ll (S.D.N.Y. l978). Just as the\nGovernment has a continuing duty to disclose discoverable material after its initial Rule l6\nproduction, so the defense has the same continuing duty. See Fed. R.

United States v. Bruce,\n75 F. App’x 849, 85l (2d Cir. 2oo3); see United States v.

She claims to have kept a\njournal for a period in l996 in which she described various events, including her interactions\nwith Jeffrey Epstein. Seven (7) photocopied pages of this journal, two of which are the front and\nback covers, were selectively produced by BSF in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> during civil litigation to counsel for\nMs. Maxwell, apparently as support for her claims against Epstein. The civil litigation was\nstayed and ultimately dismissed prior to resolution of questions related to the failure to produce\nthe entire journal.

This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original\nrequest was ex parte, nou the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms.\nMaxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of\nevidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the\nsubpoena, not to the government.\n\nRequest ll, the Photographs\n\nRegarding item ll, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical\npositions. In its leter of May 4, 2o2l, the government first advised the Court that it obtained\n“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.\nTwo days later it admited that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution\nTeam’s possession” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page8ofl2\nleading questions about what Jane told the Government, the defendant has atempted to establish\na basis for impeachment by contradiction.

PAGLIUCA: Yes. So we are objecting to the late\n\n2 endorsement and the calling of the witness, first on simply\n\n3 disclosure issues, but second, I'm unclear of the relevance,\n\n4 given the lack of any, I'll call it, tying to any actual\n\n5 testimony.\n\n6 We're going to get a DMV record, as I understand it,\n\n7 from this witness that no one else who has testified has ever\n\n8 done any comparator between whatever is in the DMV record and\n\n9 either photographs or other information about the witness that\nlo Mr. Rodgers talked about.

MOE: Yes, your Honor. This exhibit and this\n\nl6 evidence is directly responsive to an issue raised by the\n\nl7 defense in their cross examination of both pilots in this case.\nl8 As the Court may recall, defense counsel suggested\n\nl9 that the Jane in the records in the l99os could potentially be\n2o the person with the first name Jane from the 2ooos. We have\n2l produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and is nontestifying witness materials,\n22 ample material that makes it clear that could not possibly --\n23 and in response to the suggestion that it might be this\n24 different person, we nou need to clarify the record on that.\n25 As defense counsel knous, the second Jane from the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 8 of 267 2o35\nLCACmaxl\n\nl about a photograph of this defendant -- of this person which is\n\n2 the same as the photograph the defense has already offered and\n\n3 connecting that up with her date of birth, which is information\n\n4 that is not a mystery to the defense, they've been in\n\n5 possession of that information for a long time nou through\n\n6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019256.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel8 of l9\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019259.jpg": "Cas6 ds2@¢rats3 DAdin Bbc SitB2o AletPG9/GR)28 aRageiDof 5\nreference, but not file, other <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material that the Government produced in this case. For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), a Court may enter a protective order\nonly after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\nprotective order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.\nSee Dkt. No. 35 at l (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating\nto the proposed protective order.”). The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a\nprovision that stated that all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt. No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o protective order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 9 l(a), lo(a), l4(a).

Tn the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.” In re Teligent,\nInc., 64o F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation omited). Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for\nmodification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context. See, e.g., United States v. Calderon,\nNo. 3:l5-CR-25 (JCH), 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (applying the civil standard for the\nmodification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she\nfurnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be\nmade in those maters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order\nto allou such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those maters. In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2.

That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-l, the\nRecipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by\nthe protective order; and\n\n6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of\nRule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this criminal mater.\n\nWith the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil\nmaters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the leter\nfiled on the public docket by the Government on this issue.

Although this\nCourt remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that\nthose courts can make their oun determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by\nthe protective order in this mater, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the\nrelevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the\nrelevant judicial decision makers and civil maters.\n\nIn addition, the Government has indicated that “there is no impediment to counsel\nmaking sealed applications to Court-l and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant\nmaterials.” Dkt.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019274.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagell of l2\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Kahn, & Ghislaine Maxwell,\nl9-lo475-LGS-DCF\nDear Judge Freeman:\n\nPursuant to Individual Rule I.D, Plaintiff Annie Farmer hereby responds to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s request for a pre-motion conference in connection with her anticipated\nmotion to stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this mater. The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion\nconference and deny her anticipated motion in its entirety because, as explained belou, each of\nMaxwell’s reasons for staying <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is meritless and the motion is simply another atempt to\nunjustifiably delay this litigation.\n\nFirst, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n“TA] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been\ncharacterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis Vuiton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d\n83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). In this Circuit, courts balance the\nfollouing six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal\nproceedings:\n\nl) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented\n\nin the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have\n\nbeen indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously\n\nweighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private\n\ninterests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the\n\npublic interest.\n\nId. at 99. And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending\na criminal investigation: “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a\ncivil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a\nstay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.” In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig.,\nl33 F.R.D. l2, l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. l99o) (emphasis added) (internal citations omited). The Court\nshould deny Maxwell’s motion for a stay without prejudice to her ability to renew her application\nif she is arrested. Until that happens, houever, there are no grounds for a stay.\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019318.jpg": "Case £4999l 6G95..Reosustent SolineH2 72o. RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the litigation to have in hand certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> concerning such conduct. Maxwell v. Estate of\nJeffrey E. Epstein, et al., ST-2o-CV-l55 (V.I. Super. Ct.); Willie v. Amerada Hess Corp., 66 VI.\n23, 92 (Super. Ct. 2ol7) (common law indemnification is only available “where an innocent party\nis held vicariously liable for the actions of the true tortfeasor” (emphases in original) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019319.jpg": "Case £49% 9ol 6495.osustent Bodine 72o, RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 3 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C.

The claims resolution program is therefore not a\nvalid basis to stay this action without Plaintiffs consent.”\n\nThird, Maxwell contends that her motion to dismiss is “strong and warrants a stay of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> pending its resolution.” Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion\nto dismiss in her response to Maxwell’s leter requesting a pre-motion conference on that motion.\nECF No. 48. Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated\nmotion to dismiss should not stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\nanticipated motion to stay <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay. Fact <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this mater ends in less than two months, and we\nrespectfully submit that her delay tactics should end nou.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ David Boies\n\nDavid Boies, Esq.\ncc: Counsel of Record (via ECF)\n2 Maxwell also argues that the fact that Plaintiffs sister (and a few other victims) have\nvoluntarily stayed their cases in light of a potential claims resolution program warrants a ruling\nthat Plaintiff must stay her case as well. This makes no sense. Plaintiff and her sister filed separate\nactions and are separate litigants. Plaintiffs sister’s decisions do not bind Plaintiff, nor do any\nother victims’ decisions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019328.jpg": "Caseas2oos8oo33o-cclm eDocantait G/2oRiledaDa2/2 PP abagelat 5\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: _ 9/2/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant. OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019335.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DH29HPabageLot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019337.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-AIm eDoedntal 42o Filed DHI29H PC abagea of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to litigate\na civil case.

In\nits opposition, the Government explained the factual background regarding the\nconfidential criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at issue. In particular, the Government\nexplained that those <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials related to the Government’s requests to\nmodify certain protective orders in civil cases to permit compliance with grand\njury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”’). Those Subpoenas were issued to a certain\nrecipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. In order to maintain the integrity\nof the grand jury investigation and in accordance with both Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not notify\nMaxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas,\nthe Recipient advised the Government that it believed that certain existing\nprotective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in or about February\n2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019348.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page6 of 24\n\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with\nthe Subpoenas. In or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the\nGovernment’s application, and permited the Government to share Court-l’s\norder—and only that order, which itself prohibited further dissemination—to the\nRecipient. Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Government’s\napplication. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain\nunder seal, except that both have expressly permited the Government to produce\nthose filings to Maxwell as part of its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this criminal case.\n\n6. After providing that factual background, the Government\nargued that Maxwell’s motion should be denied for failing to shou good cause to\nmodify the Protective Order for several reasons. First, Maxwell had consented to\nthe portions of the Protective Order that prohibit use of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials produced by the Government in any civil litigation. Second, Maxwell\nhad cited no authority to support the argument that a criminal defendant should be\npermited to use criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in civil cases. Third, Maxwell uterly failed to\nexplain hou the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at issue supported any legal argument\nshe wished to make in civil litigation. The Government also noted that to the\nextent Maxwell sought to challenge the process by which the Government sought\ncompliance with the Subpoenas and obtained certain materials that it intended to\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019349.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page7 of 24\n\nuse in prosecuting its criminal case, she would have a full opportunity to do so in\nher pretrial motions in the criminal case before Judge Nathan.\n\n7. On August 24, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a reply in further support of\nher motion. (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 54).\n\n8. On September 2, 2o2o, Judge Nathan issued the Order denying\nMaxwell’s motion. (Ex. F). In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite\n“fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had offered “no more\nthan vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions” regarding why the criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases. (/d. at\n3). Judge Nathan concluded that absent any “coherent explanation” of hou the\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials related to any argument Maxwell intended to make in\ncivil litigation, Maxwell had “plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\nProtective Order. (/d.). Further, Judge Nathan noted that the basic facts Maxwell\nsought to introduce in civil litigation were already made public through the\nGovernment’s leter in opposition to her motion. (/d. at 3-4). Accordingly, even\nthough Judge Nathan “remain[ed] in the dark as to why this information will be\nrelevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, Judge Nathan expressly\npermited Maxwell to inform the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic series of events set forth in paragraph 5, supra. (/d. at 4).\n\n9. On September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019354.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel2 of 24\n\nl4. When applying the collateral-order doctrine, the Supreme Court\nhas “generally denied review of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> orders.” Firestone Tire &\nRubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (l98l). This Court likewise has\nconsistently ruled that protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged\nby the parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal. See,\ne.g., United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. l986) (“We hold that this\ncollateral protective order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § l29l... .”); United\nStates v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d Cir. l996) (“To the extent that the\n[protective] order imposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materials\nexchanged in the course of pending litigation, it is not subject to appeal.’’); see also\nHL.

Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o (2d Cir.\nl986) (“The district court’s denial of modification [of a protective order] does not\nfall within the ‘collateral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”). Because “a litigant does not\nhave ‘an unrestrained right to disseminate information that has been obtained\nthrough pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,’” such protective orders do not amount to an\nimpermissible prior restraint under the First Amendment. Caparros, 8oo F.2d at\n25 (quoting Seatle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 2o, 3l (l984)). Even where a\nlitigant raises a colorable argument that a protective order violates a litigant’s right\nto release documents outside of criminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right\ncan await final judgment on the underlying charges” because the “purported right\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019355.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel3 of 24\n\nat issue is not related to any right not to stand trial.” Jd. at 26.\n\n2.

Discussion\n\nl6. There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and\nthus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that\nconstitute immediately appealable collateral orders. Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S.\nat 522. Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrou category of\ncollateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019356.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel4 of 24\nrule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be\ndismissed. Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).\nAmong other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for\nidentifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order\nbeing appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omited)\n(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468). Accordingly, this Court does not\nhave jurisdiction to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nl7. As an initial mater, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this\nCourt cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts\nof this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim\nbelongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7 (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nCoopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\nInc., 5ll U.S. 863, 868 (l994)). Here, like any other order regulating the use of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order in this criminal case is not subject\nto interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26.\nl8. There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within\nthe four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable\nprejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy,\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019357.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel5 of 24\nthe Speech or Debate Clause, or the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs.\nSee Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799; Sell, 539 U.S. at l76-77. The rights\nimplicated here do not meet the high threshold of expanding the collateral order\nexception in criminal cases beyond those limited categories. Rather, this Order\nfalls within the category of rulings addressing pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which are\ngenerally unreviewable on interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798;\nCaparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26. Maxwell has identified no public interest or value\nthat is “sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until\nlitigation concludes.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7.\n\nl9. Maxwell seems to claim that reversal of Judge Nathan’s Order\nis necessary in order to prevent documents in a civil case from being unsealed.\nEven assuming a presentation of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials would affect an\nunsealing decision in a civil case — an argument that Judge Nathan found\nspeculative at best (Ex. F at 3) — a risk of unsealing is not significant enough to\nmerit interlocutory appeal. See United States v. Martoma, No. l3-48o7, 2ol4 WL\n68ll9, at *l (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2ol4) (concluding that even though the defendant’s\n“personal interest in the privacy of embarrassing information is an interest that, as\na practical mater, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that interest is\ninsufficient to merit interlocutory appeal); United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d\n99o, 998 (9th Cir. 2ol2) (finding no jurisdiction over defendant’s interlocutory\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019359.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel7 of 24\n\nright to an impartial jury. See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol-o4,\n2l3 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (vacating conviction where district court improperly refused to\nexcuse potential juror who admited bias based upon knouledge of defendant’s\nprevious acquital). Thus, the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury would\nnot “be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S.\nat 799 (internal quotation mark omited) (quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435\nU.S. 85o, 86o (l978)), and, as such, the Order does not meet the third criterion for\nappealability of a collateral order. See Punn, 737 F.3d at l4 (defendant’s interests\n“can be adequately vindicated upon appeal from a final judgment” through “a new\ntrial... or whatever additional remedies are necessary”).\n\n2l. Simply put, the Order denying Maxwell’s motion to amend the\nProtective Order is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal. Maxwell complains\nthat if she cannot use criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in civil litigation then there is a\nrisk that certain filings in the civil cases may be unsealed that otherwise would\nhave remained sealed. Maxwell apparently believes such a result would risk\nprejudicing her trial rights in the criminal case. If such materials are unsealed in\nthe civil case, and if Maxwell believes that unsealing causes her prejudice at her\ncriminal trial, Maxwell will have a full opportunity to raise that issue in the\ncriminal case. To the extent Maxwell is concerned that unsealing in the civil case\nmight permit the Government to oppose any motion challenging the unsealing\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019360.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel8 of 24\norder it obtained during its criminal investigation on the grounds of inevitable\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, she will have the opportunity to assert such a claim before Judge\nNathan. If she is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s decision on that score, she can\nraise the issue on appeal after the entry of final judgment.\n\n22. Further, given the substance of Maxwell’s motion to\nconsolidate, it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in\nthis appeal have been finally resolved. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate this\nmater with the Giuffre v. Maxwell appeal appears primarily focused on atacking\nthe legitimacy of the Government’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends\nto use to prosecute the criminal case through the Subpoenas to the Recipient. (See\nMot. at lo-l2). It thus seems readily apparent that Maxwell intends to file a\nmotion to preclude the use of such evidence at her criminal trial. Yet she seeks to\nhave this Court reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the\ncivil appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by\nthe District Court in the criminal case. As Judge Nathan has not yet addressed (or\neven had the opportunity to address) that issue in the criminal case, the issues\nMaxwell raises on this appeal do not appear to be final. Any such arguments are\nproperly heard in the criminal case in the first instance by the district judge, “who\nplay[s] a ‘special role’ in managing ongoing litigation,” and who “can beter\nexercise [his or her] responsibility [to police the preyudment tactics of litigants] if\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oool936o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019361.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel9 of 24\nthe appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment\nrulings.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo6 (alterations in original) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller,\n472 U.S. 424, 436 (l985)).\n\n23. The cases cited in Maxwell’s notice of appeal do not alter this\nanalysis. All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors —\nnot parties — seeking to modify protective orders in civil cases. See Pichler v.\nUNITE, 585 F.3d 74l, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2oo9) (third party intervernor foundation\nappealing order denying motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to\nallou third party access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials); Minpeco S.A. v.

Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll7 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (emphasis added). By contrast,\nrulings governing the parties’ use of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials — such as Judge Nathan’s\nOrder here — are not appealable in the context of a criminal prosecution until after\njudgment is entered. See Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\n24. Judge Nathan’s Order does not fall into one of the narrou\ncategories of decisions in a criminal case reviewable on interlocutory appeal.\nAccordingly, Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nHi. THE MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE SHOULD BE DENIED\n\n25. Even if Maxwell’s appeal is not dismissed — which it should\nbe — her motion to consolidate the appeal in this criminal case with the appeal in\nthe Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case should be denied.\n\n26. Despite Maxwell’s efforts to characterize this criminal case as\nsomehou intertwined with the Giuffre civil case, the issues on appeal are factually\nand legally distinct. The civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s order unsealing civil\nlitigation materials. The Government is not a party to the civil suit, the\nGovernment has never intervened or appeared in the civil suit, the Government has\nhad no role in the litigation that resulted in Judge Preska’s order, and the\nGovernment has no legal interest in the relief Maxwell seeks in the civil case.

If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s\nrulings on those maters, she will have a full opportunity to appeal those rulings\nafter entry of final judgment in her criminal case. The Court should not permit\nMaxwell to raise these issues at this juncture, before they have been fully litigated\nbefore and adjudicated by the presiding district judge.\n\n28. Moreover, Maxwell’s motion to consolidate is a transparent\natempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this\nappeal. That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits\nMaxwell from using certain criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in civil litigation. If this\nCourt were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in\nboth cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in\nthe manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge\nNathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without\nrequiring Maxwell to shou that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by\ndenying Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.” Indeed, Maxwell’s\nmotion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left\n* Moreover, if the appeals were consolidated, the sealed filings in this criminal\nappeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal.

The mater remains pending in the\npretrial phase before the Honorable Alison J.

On July 3o, 2o2o, upon the Government’s application, Judge\nNathan entered a protective order governing the parties’ disclosure of information\nproduced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the criminal case (the “Protective Order’). (Ex. A). The\nProtective Order expressly provides that any and all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material produced to\nMaxwell by the Government, regardless of designation, “[s|hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this\ncriminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” (Protective Order {/] l(a), lo(a), l4(a)). The Protective\nOrder further provides that any <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material produced to Maxwell by the\nGovernment that is marked “confidential” may not be filed publicly or excerpted\nwithin any public filing. (/d. 4 l5). Maxwell’s criminal defense counsel consented\nto the foregoing provisions of the Protective Order. (See Dist. Ct. Docket Entry\n29).\n\n4.

On August 2l, 2o2o, the Government filed an opposition to\nMaxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order. (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 46). In\nits opposition, the Government explained the factual background regarding the\nconfidential criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at issue. In particular, the Government\nexplained that those <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials related to the Government’s requests to\nmodify certain protective orders in civil cases to permit compliance with grand\njury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”’). Those Subpoenas were issued to a certain\nrecipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. In order to maintain the integrity\nof the grand jury investigation and in accordance with both Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not notify\nMaxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas,\nthe Recipient advised the Government that it believed that certain existing\nprotective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in or about February\n2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool937o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019371.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Paged of 23\n\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with\nthe Subpoenas. In or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the\nGovernment’s application, and permited the Government to share Court-l’s\norder—and only that order, which itself prohibited further dissemination—to the\nRecipient. Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Government’s\napplication. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain\nunder seal, except that both have expressly permited the Government to produce\nthose filings to Maxwell as part of its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this criminal case.\n\n6. After providing that factual background, the Government\nargued that Maxwell’s motion should be denied for failing to shou good cause to\nmodify the Protective Order for several reasons. First, Maxwell had consented to\nthe portions of the Protective Order that prohibit use of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials produced by the Government in any civil litigation.

On August 24, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a reply in further support of\nher motion. (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 54).\n\n8. On September 2, 2o2o, Judge Nathan issued the Order denying\nMaxwell’s motion. (Ex. F). In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite\n“fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had offered “no more\nthan vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions” regarding why the criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases. (/d. at\n3). Judge Nathan concluded that absent any “coherent explanation” of hou the\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials related to any argument Maxwell intended to make in\ncivil litigation, Maxwell had “plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\nProtective Order. (/d.). Further, Judge Nathan noted that the basic facts Maxwell\nsought to introduce in civil litigation were already made public through the\nGovernment’s leter in opposition to her motion. (/d. at 3-4). Accordingly, even\nthough Judge Nathan “remain[ed] in the dark as to why this information will be\nrelevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, Judge Nathan expressly\npermited Maxwell to inform the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic series of events set forth in paragraph 5, supra. (/d. at 4).\n\n9. On September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019377.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagell of 23\n\nl4.

Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (l98l). This Court likewise has\nconsistently ruled that protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged\nby the parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal. See,\ne.g., United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. l986) (“We hold that this\ncollateral protective order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § l29l... .”); United\nStates v.

Because “a litigant does not\nhave ‘an unrestrained right to disseminate information that has been obtained\nthrough pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>,’” such protective orders do not amount to an\nimpermissible prior restraint under the First Amendment. Caparros, 8oo F.2d at\n25 (quoting Seatle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 2o, 3l (l984)).

Discussion\n\nl6. There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and\nthus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that\nconstitute immediately appealable collateral orders. Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S.\nat 522. Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrou category of\ncollateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019379.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel3 of 23\nrule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be\ndismissed. Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).\nAmong other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for\nidentifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order\nbeing appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omited)\n(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468). Accordingly, this Court does not\nhave jurisdiction to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nl7. As an initial mater, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this\nCourt cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts\nof this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim\nbelongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7 (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nCoopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\nInc., 5ll U.S. 863, 868 (l994)). Here, like any other order regulating the use of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order in this criminal case is not subject\nto interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26.\nl8. There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within\nthe four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable\nprejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy,\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019380.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel4 of 23\nthe Speech or Debate Clause, or the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs.\nSee Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799; Sell, 539 U.S. at l76-77. The rights\nimplicated here do not meet the high threshold of expanding the collateral order\nexception in criminal cases beyond those limited categories. Rather, this Order\nfalls within the category of rulings addressing pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which are\ngenerally unreviewable on interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798;\nCaparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26. Maxwell has identified no public interest or value\nthat is “sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until\nlitigation concludes.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7.\n\nl9. Maxwell seems to claim that reversal of Judge Nathan’s Order\nis necessary in order to prevent documents in a civil case from being unsealed.\nEven assuming a presentation of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials would affect an\nunsealing decision in a civil case — an argument that Judge Nathan found\nspeculative at best (Ex. F at 3) — a risk of unsealing is not significant enough to\nmerit interlocutory appeal. See United States v. Martoma, No. l3-48o7, 2ol4 WL\n68ll9, at *l (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2ol4) (concluding that even though the defendant’s\n“personal interest in the privacy of embarrassing information is an interest that, as\na practical mater, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that interest is\ninsufficient to merit interlocutory appeal); United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d\n99o, 998 (9th Cir. 2ol2) (finding no jurisdiction over defendant’s interlocutory\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool938o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019382.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel6 of 23\n\nright to an impartial jury. See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol-o4,\n2l3 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (vacating conviction where district court improperly refused to\nexcuse potential juror who admited bias based upon knouledge of defendant’s\nprevious acquital). Thus, the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury would\nnot “be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S.\nat 799 (internal quotation mark omited) (quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435\nU.S. 85o, 86o (l978)), and, as such, the Order does not meet the third criterion for\nappealability of a collateral order. See Punn, 737 F.3d at l4 (defendant’s interests\n“can be adequately vindicated upon appeal from a final judgment” through “a new\ntrial... or whatever additional remedies are necessary”).\n\n2l. Simply put, the Order denying Maxwell’s motion to amend the\nProtective Order is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal. Maxwell complains\nthat if she cannot use criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in civil litigation then there is a\nrisk that certain filings in the civil cases may be unsealed that otherwise would\nhave remained sealed. Maxwell apparently believes such a result would risk\nprejudicing her trial rights in the criminal case. If such materials are unsealed in\nthe civil case, and if Maxwell believes that unsealing causes her prejudice at her\ncriminal trial, Maxwell will have a full opportunity to raise that issue in the\ncriminal case. To the extent Maxwell is concerned that unsealing in the civil case\nmight permit the Government to oppose any motion challenging the unsealing\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019383.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel7 of 23\norder it obtained during its criminal investigation on the grounds of inevitable\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, she will have the opportunity to assert such a claim before Judge\nNathan. If she is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s decision on that score, she can\nraise the issue on appeal after the entry of final judgment.\n\n22. Further, given the substance of Maxwell’s motion to\nconsolidate, it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in\nthis appeal have been finally resolved. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate this\nmater with the Giuffre v. Maxwell appeal appears primarily focused on atacking\nthe legitimacy of the Government’s methods of obtaining evidence that it intends\nto use to prosecute the criminal case through the Subpoenas to the Recipient. (See\nMot. at lo-l2). It thus seems readily apparent that Maxwell intends to file a\nmotion to preclude the use of such evidence at her criminal trial. Yet she seeks to\nhave this Court reach the merits of her arguments on that issue in the context of the\ncivil appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated by\nthe District Court in the criminal case. As Judge Nathan has not yet addressed (or\neven had the opportunity to address) that issue in the criminal case, the issues\nMaxwell raises on this appeal do not appear to be final. Any such arguments are\nproperly heard in the criminal case in the first instance by the district judge, “who\nplay[s] a ‘special role’ in managing ongoing litigation,” and who “can beter\nexercise [his or her] responsibility [to police the preyudment tactics of litigants] if\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oool9383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019384.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel8 of 23\nthe appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment\nrulings.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo6 (alterations in original) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller,\n472 U.S. 424, 436 (l985)).\n\n23. The cases cited in Maxwell’s notice of appeal do not alter this\nanalysis. All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors —\nnot parties — seeking to modify protective orders in civil cases. See Pichler v.\nUNITE, 585 F.3d 74l, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2oo9) (third party intervernor foundation\nappealing order denying motion to modify protective order in civil litigation to\nallou third party access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials); Minpeco S.A. v.

Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those cases\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019385.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel9 of 23\nwas founded on the principle that when intervenors seek access to sealed records,\n“orders denying access are final as to the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll7 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (emphasis added). By contrast,\nrulings governing the parties’ use of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials — such as Judge Nathan’s\nOrder here — are not appealable in the context of a criminal prosecution until after\njudgment is entered. See Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\n24. Judge Nathan’s Order does not fall into one of the narrou\ncategories of decisions in a criminal case reviewable on interlocutory appeal.\nAccordingly, Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nHi. THE MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE SHOULD BE DENIED\n\n25. Even if Maxwell’s appeal is not dismissed — which it should\nbe — her motion to consolidate the appeal in this criminal case with the appeal in\nthe Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case should be denied.\n\n26. Despite Maxwell’s efforts to characterize this criminal case as\nsomehou intertwined with the Giuffre civil case, the issues on appeal are factually\nand legally distinct. The civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s order unsealing civil\nlitigation materials. The Government is not a party to the civil suit, the\nGovernment has never intervened or appeared in the civil suit, the Government has\nhad no role in the litigation that resulted in Judge Preska’s order, and the\nGovernment has no legal interest in the relief Maxwell seeks in the civil case.

If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s\nrulings on those maters, she will have a full opportunity to appeal those rulings\nafter entry of final judgment in her criminal case. The Court should not permit\nMaxwell to raise these issues at this juncture, before they have been fully litigated\nbefore and adjudicated by the presiding district judge.\n\n28. Moreover, Maxwell’s motion to consolidate is a transparent\natempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this\nappeal. That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits\nMaxwell from using certain criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in civil litigation. If this\nCourt were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in\nboth cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in\nthe manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge\nNathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without\nrequiring Maxwell to shou that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by\ndenying Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.” Indeed, Maxwell’s\nmotion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left\n* Moreover, if the appeals were consolidated, the sealed filings in this criminal\nappeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal.

Jd.\nat 798. This Court distinguished the differing results based on the breadth of the\nprotective order’s ban. Jd. As this Court said, “to the extent that the order\nprohibits Pappas from disclosure of information he acquired from the Government\nprior to the litigation, the order is not a typical protective order regulating\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> documents and should be appealable because of the breadth of its\nrestraint.” Jd. (citing United States v. Salameh, 992 F.2d 445, 446-47 (2d Cir.\nl993)).\n\nBeyond standing for the proposition that interlocutory appeals are the\nexception and not the rule (which Ms. Maxwell doesn’t dispute), Pappas has\nnothing to add to the analysis here. Even strictly construing the three requirements\nfor collateral order jurisdiction, see Will, 546 U.S. at 349, the order here meets the\ntest.\n\nThe balance of the government’s argument against jurisdiction\nmisunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s position. For example, according to the\ngovernment, “it is not entirely clear that all of the issues Maxwell seeks to raise in\nthis appeal have been finally resolved.” Doc. 37, p l7. Ms. Maxwell’s argument,\nsays the government, is “primarily focused on atacking the legitimacy of the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oool942l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019434.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 6o, o9/24/2o2o, 2938278, Page35 of 58\nbelieved. According to the government,\neC\nSS\na\n\nBut if that’s true, then the government should have moved to intervene\nbefore Judge Preska to oppose the unsealing of the deposition material, since, in the\ngovernment’s view, that material is confidential. The (unprincipled) reason for the\ngovernment’s decision not to intervene is obvious: If Ms. Maxwell’s depositions\nare released to the public, the government will argue to Judge Nathan that any\nviolation of Martindell was harmless.\n\nIt’s immaterial that the court stayed Doe v.

As this Court recognized in Louzs\nVuiton, “if civil defendants do not elect to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege,\nand instead fully cooperate with <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, their ‘testimony . . . in their defense in\nthe civil action is likely to constitute admissions of criminal conduct in their\ncriminal prosecution.’” 676 F.3d at 98 (quoting SEC v.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl Atachment A to Opening\nBrief\nDOJ-OGR-oool944o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019441.jpg": "Cases e@:2o-626o3BoAuhenDoCuatent 2D 26 jl26 B5/o2/2oage ager at 5\nreference, but not file, other <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material that the Government produced in this case.

Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\nprotective order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted.\nSee Dkt.

The Defendant’s Proposed Protective Order included a\nprovision that stated that all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.

In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause.

See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oool9442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019443.jpg": "Caesese@:2o-626o3BoAuNenDoOCuatent 2D 2Ejl26B5/o2/2oagedgea at 5\n\n3.

In April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”) permited the modification and, subsequently,\nanother court (“Court-2”) did not;\n\n5.

(See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.)

(See generally id.)\n\nOn August 27, 2o2o, the Co-Executors submited a leter consenting to the entry of a stay\nand joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding. (See Leter to the\nCourt from Bennet J. Moskouitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2o2o (“8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.”)\n\n(Dkt. 77).) The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay\nof this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a\npartial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims\nand would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at l-2.) The Co-Executors also\npointed out that, if this mater were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of\nher claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)\nthat has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases\nbefore the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)\n\nBy leter dated August 27, 2o2o, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing\nthat the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief.

MAXWELL’S MOTION FOR A STAY\n\nA. Applicable Legal Standards\n\nAlthough staying a civil action pending the completion of a criminal prosecution against\na named defendant has been characterized as an “extraordinary remedy,” Louis Vuiton Malletier\nS\\A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2), “courts will not hesitate to grant a stay\n‘when the interests of justice seem to require’ it,” Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. LaGuardia,\n435 F. Supp. 3d 6l6, 62l (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (citing Jn re Worldcom, Inc. Securities Litigation,\nNo. o2cv3288 (DLC), 2oo2 WL 3l7295ol, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2oo2)) (granting a stay where\nthere was overlap of issues in the civil and criminal cases and explaining that overlap of issues is\na particularly significant factor); see also Trustees of Plumbers & Pipefiters Nat. Pension\nFund v. Transworld Mech., Inc., 886 F. Supp. ll34 (S.D.N.Y. l995) (same); Volmar Distributors,\nInc. v. New York Post Co., l52 F.R.D. 36, 42 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (staying civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> pending\ncompletion of the criminal case against the defendant); Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Shkreli,\nNo. l5-CV-7l75 (KAM) (RML), 2ol6 WL ll22o29, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2ol6) (same).\n\nUltimately, the decision as to whether to issue such a stay rests in the discretion of the\ndistrict court, Louis Vuiton Malletier, 676 F.3d at 99, and each case requires a particularized\ninquiry, see id., at 98. In determining whether a civil action should be stayed in the face of a\nparallel criminal proceeding, courts in this District have generally been guided by six factors:\n(l) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil\ncase; (2) the status of the criminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted;\n(3) the private interests of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice\nto the plaintiff caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant;\n(5) the interests of the court(s); and (6) the public interest. See id.; see also, e.g., Trustees of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019450.jpg": "Case C22@-Go- O84 DGtuDER ODocamdiGA, FACE DEl ade Haye’ of l3\nPlumbers and Pipefiters Nat.

The party seeking the stay\n“bears the burden of establishing its need,” Louis Vuiton Malletier, 676 F.3d at 97 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited), and this burden may be met where, on balance, the\nrelevant factors suggest that proceeding with the civil action will likely result in undue prejudice\nto the defendant, see id. (noting that “absent a shouing of undue prejudice . . . there is no reason\nwhy [a] plaintiff should be delayed in its efforts to diligently proceed to sustain its claim”\n(internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omited)).\n\nB. The Relevant Factors Weigh in Favor of Granting a Stay of This Action.\n\nIn this instance, as discussed belou, the relevant factors support Maxell’s application for\na stay.\n\nl. Overlap Between the Civil and Criminal Cases\n\n“The strongest case for granting a stay is where a party under criminal indictment is\nrequired to defend a civil proceeding involving the same mater.” Volmar Distributors, l52\nF.R.D. at 39 (emphasis added) (citations omited); accord In re Worldcom, 2oo2 WL 3l7295ol,\nat *5. Denying a stay where there is significant factual overlap between the civil and criminal\ncases may “undermine a defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination . . .\nexpand the rights of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> beyond the limits of Rule l6(b) of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure, expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution in advance of trial, or\notherwise prejudice the case.” Volmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 39 (citations omited); see also\nJohnson v. New York City Police Dep’t, No. olcv657o (RCC) (JCF), 2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. July l6, 2oo3).\n\nAs a threshold mater, this Court finds that, in this instance, there is significant factual\noverlap between this civil case and the pending criminal case. For example, as Maxwell points\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool945o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019452.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl ade Bayeds of l3\n\nHere, Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury on June 29, 2o2o; she has been detained\npending her criminal trial; and her trial date has been set. (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 2.) Should\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend\nherself by making pretrial disclosures and giving deposition testimony (which could be used\nagainst her in the criminal case) or to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination (which would protect her in the criminal case, but which could well result in an\nadverse inference being drawn against her in the civil case). (See id., at 4; see also Louis Vuiton\nMalletier, 676 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment privilege that may\nbe posed by parallel proceedings).) This legitimate concern, made more real and immediate by\nthe active posture of criminal case, militates in favor of a stay.\n\n3. The Interests of the Plaintiff\n\nPlaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding would harm her interests because, as she is\nsuffering “ongoing damaging effects” from the alleged abuse, and she should not have to wait\nany longer to hold Defendants accountable. (8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 4.) While, as a general\nmater, plaintiffs have a strong interest in the expeditious resolution of their civil claims, see\nVolmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 4o, Plaintiff here has not advanced any particularized reason\nwhy a delay would cause her prejudice, such as a likely loss of physical evidence or witness\ntestimony during the period of a stay. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at l (noting that “there is\nlitle chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this\ncase”); see also id., at 4.)\n\nAdditionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to\nagree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the Compensation Program (and, in fact,\nrecognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019453.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl H2de Hayes of l3\nin her ability to seek redress for the sexual assaults and other tortious conduct on which her\nclaims are based, as, during the pendency of any stay, she would still be able to participate in that\nprogram.\n\nOverall, and despite Plaintiffs assertion that a stay would work to her disadvantage, this\nCourt finds that any generalized prejudice that she would suffer as the result of a stay is not\nsufficient to counterbalance the other factors that the Court should consider, which all heavily\nfavor a stay.\n\n4, The Interests of the Defendant\n\nThe private interests of Maxwell, and the burden that she would face in proceeding with\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the civil action at this time are significant. As already noted, if civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> were\nto proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege — a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of\nthe cases she is defending. See Louis Vuiton, 676 F.3d at 97. Also, due to heightened\nrestrictions at the MDC during the COVID-l9 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes\njudicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to\nhave difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to\nconfer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.,\nat 5; see also 9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)\n\nThis Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell,\nbut also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current detention, would\nnecessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> process in this action,\nand would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool9453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019454.jpg": "Case Casec¥oo6464-JGKDGAt Docifienl82o AieeBbege.A72%eRage lo of l3\n5. The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in the civil case could\nconserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil\ncase, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n vy. Abraj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. l9cv3244\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol9). As observed by the Government, the\npending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,\nand may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this\ncase. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has\nsome interest in coordinating <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have\nbeen brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are\ncurrently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> may\nbe imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil\ncase were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to\ninformation in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> here. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information\nabout the criminal mater is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has\nentered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that\nMaxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information’); see\nalso 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures,\nthat, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited\nfrom disclosing certain information in the civil case).)\n\nThus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019455.jpg": "Case Ca2sec?oo6464-JGKDGAt Dodifien82o MieeBeegeA72Mehage 44 of l3\n6.

Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil\nlitigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a\nwrongdoer. (/d.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently\nbeing litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation\nof this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant\nMaxwell’s well knoun criminal enterprise, hou it was operated and all those involved.” (/d.) It\nis a mischaracterization of this action, houever, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for\naddressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell\nhas been stayed, it has not been terminated — just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.\nMoreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity\nof criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr.) Should civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> proceed, there\nis a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature disclosure of the\ntestimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson,\n2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of\ngranting a stay.\n\nAccordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell\nhas met her burden to shou that a stay of this action is warranted.\n\nC. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.\n\nThe Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant\nMaxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety. Indeed, the\nCo-Executors take pains to argue that a partial stay as to only Plaintiff's claims against Maxwell\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019456.jpg": "Case Casec?oo6464-JGKDGAt Dhodifienl82o AiReBbeIe.472%ePAge l2 of l3\nwould unduly prejudice their ability to mount their oun defense. (See 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr.,\nat l-2.) Where one defendant is a central figure in an action, and where that individual’s\ntestimony is of key importance, a partial stay can lead to duplicative <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> efforts. Trustees\nof Plumbers and Pipefiters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at ll4l. This Court is persuaded\nthat, as Maxwell is a central figure in this civil case, a stay of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that applies only to her\nwould prejudice the Co-Executors by requiring them to conduct <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> without having the\nopportunity to depose Maxwell or collect documents in her possession. (See 8/27/2o Moskouitz\nLtr., at l-2.) Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay\nis lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may\nhave already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is\nobtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses. (See id. at 2.)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s motion for a stay of this action, in its entirety,\npending the completion of the criminal prosecution against her (Dkt. 69) is granted. If, houever,\nthe underlying circumstances change over time in a way that could affect this Court’s balancing\nof the relevant factors, then the parties may bring the changed circumstances to this Court’s\natention, and it will then consider whether the stay should continue or be lifted. Absent any\nfurther application to this Court to review the stay, the parties are directed to provide this Court\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9456\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019464.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document GbNOSKHACe NBRser 958o8o, Page7 of l25\n| o7/o7/2o2o 9 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

To optimize the\nquality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, and counsel for\nthe Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access the audio\nof the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet platform\nsystem, only one atorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of the\npress, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in\nnumber, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order.\nGiven the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding\nwill be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick\nMoynihan Courthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing\nrequirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional\npersons will be admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone\nwho appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature\ntaken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, atached. Completing\nthe questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who\nmeet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are\nbelou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the\nnose and mouth must be worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-\nl9 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.\nThere are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,\nif possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the\nDefendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able\nto sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of\nMarch 27, 2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least\n24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an\ninquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court\nto add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The Court\nwill inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate\nlogistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email\nwithin 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and\nJuly 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in\ntransferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the\nCourt further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July l4, 2o2o.\nDue to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds\n\"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A).

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be folloued\nthat shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?3477o8277l29655-L_l_o-l PP. 9/l2\nDOJ-OGR- oool9468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019469.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pmyG7ReO2OcetB@828o2 Paget2 of l25\ncriminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many\nrestrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy\nAct of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to\nscrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide\npotential witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.\nSee Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be\nsubject to examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them\nby the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing reasons,\nthe Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be entered on the\ndocket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a\nprotective order in the form atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nThe government has indicated that it requires the entry of a protective order before\nproducing any <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nApp.o39\nDOJ-OGR-oool9498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019499.jpg": "OGsedl AZADA S BOs ATT thd MAE 2o2 F ib 2AY/PagPkyefi2l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019500.jpg": "OGsedl ZADAeO SBOs ATT thd WARE 2o2 F i627 /PagPeyefisl ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019503.jpg": "CaGeide2QoeRB MOB 3o o4TMe Deter? 29-o2 OF RES O7827 289 Aagef J 2b l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~- eee eee eet LLL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° DROW ERT VE ONDER\n-v.- : CO\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n- eee eee eee LLL\nALISON J.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019522.jpg": "CaSeide2QoeROOB 2o o4IN ce Detlnien? 2-o2 OF RES O7928/289 Paget l 2b l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nApp.o87\nDOJ-OGR-oool9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019547.jpg": "Cased ADAH SBos AT en dc WHE 362 FiRABOZ2o/Pageiyef2l ab3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt. No. 33-l, 95.

And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019550.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden (hdc WHE 262 F iB 68h /Pageayef2l ab5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas’”’). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>” in this criminal case.\n\nApp.o9l\nDOJ-OGR-oool955o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019551.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos ATT (hdc WARE 262 F i688 /Pageageisi ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\nApp.o92\nDOJ-OGR-oool955l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019552.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden thd WHE 262 F i68l /Pag eeigei4l ab5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nApp.o93\nDOJ-OGR-oool9552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019553.jpg": "CGsedl ZADaKeO SBOs ATT tid WHE 262 F iB 688ol /Pag eeeiyei5s! ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases.

Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019558.jpg": "Case PAGEL ONBSOUAIEht DoOcORBAT-AL o Fue ad S7o2)2o9 eR Agecl iS\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: _ 9/2/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant. OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the Government in this case.

This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it\nmay be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  l8(b).\nThere is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> will be circumvented.

At the same time, the Court accepted jurisdiction over the\nportion of the appeal that challenged the protective order’s bar on disclosure of\ninformation the defendant acquired from the government before the litigation.

The Pro-\ntective Order expressly provides that any and all dis-\ncovery material produced to Maxwell by the Govern-\nment, regardless of designation, “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes\nof the defense of this criminal action, and not for any\ncivil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense\nof this action.” (Protective Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a)).\nThe Protective Order further provides that any discov-\nery material produced to Maxwell by the Government\nthat is marked “confidential” may not be filed publicly\nor excerpted within any public filing.

The District Court Litigation\n\nDespite having agreed to the prohibition on using\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in civil cases, on August l7,\n2o2o, Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to modify the Pro-\ntective Order to allou her to do exactly that. (A. l24-\n3l). In particular, Maxwell’s motion sought authoriza-\ntion to use materials relating to applications the Gov-\nernment previously made in 2ol9 seeking the modifi-\ncation of certain protective orders in other judicial pro-\nceedings.\n\nOn August 2l, 2o2o, the Government filed an oppo-\nsition to Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Or-\nder. (A. 9o-94). In its opposition, the Government ex-\nplained the factual background regarding the confi-\ndential criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at issue.

(A. 93-94).\nD. Judge Nathan’s Order\n\nOn September 2, 2o2o, Judge Nathan issued the\nOrder denying Maxwell’s motion. (A. 99-lo3). In that\nOrder, Judge Nathan noted that despite “fourteen-sin-\ngle spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had of-\nfered “no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory\nassertions” regarding why the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> ma-\nterials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil\ncases. (A. lol). Judge Nathan concluded that absent\nany “coherent explanation” of hou the criminal discov-\nery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-\ntended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had\n“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\nProtective Order. (A. lol). Further, Judge Nathan\nnoted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce\nin civil litigation were already made public through\nthe Government’s leter in opposition to her motion.\n(A. lol-o2). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan\n“remain|[ed] in the dark as to why this information will\nbe relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases,\nJudge Nathan expressly permited Maxwell to inform\nthe tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic factual background regarding the confiden-\ntial criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at issue. (A. lol-o2).\nE. Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-\npeal from the Order. (A. l2l-23).

Republic of Congo, 46l F.3d 238, 24l (2d\nCir. 2oo6). In a criminal case, the availability of post-\njudgment relief through reversal or vacatur of convic-\ntion, if warranted, will generally be sufficient to pro-\ntect whatever right a defendant claims was abridged\nby the district court’s pretrial decision.

(Br. l2.) The rights\nimplicated by the Order—namely, the use of pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials—do not justify expanding the lim-\nited collateral order exception, which is “interpreted\n... with the utmost strictness.” Midland Asphalt, 489\nU.S. at 799.\n\nMaxwell relies principally on three cases in seeking\nto overcome decades of Supreme Court precedent nar-\nrouly construing the exception to the requirement that\nappeals in criminal cases be from the final judgment\nof conviction.

Once the courts in those cases de-\nnied the intervenors’ motions to modify protective or-\nders, there was nothing left for those intervenors to Lit-\nigate. Here, by contrast, Judge Nathan’s Order did not\nend the entire litigation as to Maxwell. To the con-\ntrary, Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in\nDecember 2o2o and to proceed to trial in July 2o2l.\nWhen considering interlocutory appeals from rul-\nings on protective orders governing a criminal defend-\nant’s use of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, by contrast, this Court\nhas concluded it lacks jurisdiction. See Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. Maxwell cites no\ncase in which this Court has found jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory appeal of an order regulating the use of\nmaterials a criminal defendant received during litiga-\ntion, and her efforts to distinguish Pappas and Capar-\nros fall short. Pappas concluded that where a protec-\ntive order “prohibits . .. disclosure of information [a de-\nfendant] acquired from the Government prior to the\nlitigation, the order is not a typical protective order\nregulating <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> documents and should be appeal-\nable because of the breadth of its restraint.” Pappas,\n94 F.3d at 798 (emphasis added).

Accordingly, like the protective or-\nder in Caparros, the Order here will still be reviewable\non appeal after entry of final judgment.\n\nIn evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, the Court should\n“not engage in an individualized jurisdictional in-\nquiry,” but instead focus “on the entire category to\nwhich a claim belongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7. The\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order is not\nsubject to interlocutory appeal as “[p]rotective orders\nthat only regulate materials exchanged between the\nparties incident to litigation, like most <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or-\nders, are neither final orders, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l29l, nor injunctions, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l292(a)(l).” Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nMaxwell nevertheless asks this Court to engage in\nan individualized jurisdictional inquiry to justify her\nimmediate appeal. Contrary to Maxwell’s claims, the\nOrder does not meet the third criterion of the standard\nfor identifying immediately appealable collateral or-\nders, which requires that the order being appealed\nfrom be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a fi-\nnal judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522.\nShe likens her claim here to an appeal of an order\ndenying a motion to reduce bail, arguing that her ap-\npeal “will become moot if review awaits conviction and\nsentence.” (Br. l3 (quotation omited)).

To the extent Maxwell still\nwishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for other purposes after entry of final judg-\nment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization\nfrom this Court to do so then. If Maxwell complains\nthat her inability to use criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\nin civil maters may result in premature unsealing or\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, she can likewise raise\nthose claims before this Court on appeal after entry of\nfinal judgment in her criminal case.

Jan. 8, 2ol4) (concluding that even though the\ndefendant’s “personal interest in the privacy of embar-\nrassing information is an interest that, as a practical\nmater, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that in-\nterest is insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal);\nUnited States v.

In\nshort, because Judge Nathan’s Order is not effectively\nunreviewable on appeal after final judgment, Maxwell\ncannot satisfy the third prong of the collateral order\ndoctrine. ®\n\n4 Notably, though, Maxwell has not explained\nhou her desire to prevent the Government from mak-\ning an inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument has any bearing\non Judge Preska’s analysis of whether the First\nAmendment requires unsealing of judicial documents\nin a civil case. She offers no case law to support such\nan argument and does not articulate hou her desire to\nprevent the Government from making an inevitable\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument impacts the unsealing analysis in\na civil case.\n\n5 In support of her argument in favor of expand-\ning the collateral order doctrine to embrace her inter-\nlocutory appeal here, Maxwell suggests that this ap-\npeal has not and will not delay the criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool963l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019632.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page25 of 37\nl9\n\nMaxwell nevertheless argues that reversal of the\nOrder is necessary to prevent documents in a civil case\nfrom being unsealed.

At no point did Judge Nathan\nfail to apply established law, and it cannot be said that\nher careful review of the parties’ arguments was not\nwithin the bounds of permissible discretion.\n\nFirst, Maxwell still fails to articulate any legal ba-\nsis for the use of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material received from the\nGovernment in a criminal case to litigate a separate\ncivil case. Maxwell expressly consented to the entry of\na Protective Order prohibiting her from using criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials in civil litigation.7 In her motion\nto modify that Protective Order, Maxwell cited no legal\nauthority for the use of criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in civil liti-\ngation. Her appeal points to no such authority, and she\n\n7 Maxwell did so knouing that the Government\nhad charged her with perjury in connection with civil\ncases.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019637.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3o of 37\n24\ndoes not suggest that Judge Nathan commited legal\nerror when issuing the Order denying her motion.\n\nSecond, Judge Nathan did not abuse her discretion\nwhen determining that Maxwell had offered no basis\nfor determining that good cause justified a modifica-\ntion of the Protective Order. In her briefing before the\nDistrict Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explana-\ntion of hou the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials could\nhave any conceivable impact on the issues pending in\ncivil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that,\nfor example, the possibility of an inevitable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nargument by the Government should foreclose unseal-\ning in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be\naffected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a sep-\narate criminal case. In the absence of any such expla-\nnation, Judge Nathan’s Order declining to modify the\nProtective Order did not amount to an abuse of her\nbroad discretion when overseeing an ongoing criminal\ncase.\n\nEven on this appeal, Maxwell still fails to explain\nwhy she needs to use materials relating to the Govern-\nment’s applications seeking the modification of certain\nprotective orders in other judicial proceedings. As far\nas the Government is aware, the only issue pending in\nthe civil litigation in which Maxwell seeks to use those\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials involves whether the\nFirst Amendment requires that certain filings in those\ncases be made available on the public docket. Maxwell\ncannot explain why certain criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materi-\nals are relevant to the issues pending in those cases or\nhou the manner in which the Government obtained\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First Amendment principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law. (Br. 27). Maxwell claims\nthat “all [she] seeks in this appeal is the ability to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019640.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page33 of 37\n27\n\n“tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge\nPreska decide whether the information weighs against\nunsealing the deposition material or in favor of a stay.”\n(Br. 3l). To the extent Maxwell seeks to inform Judge\nPreska—or any other judicial officer—of the basic facts\nsurrounding the criminal prosecution and the criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at issue, the District Court has al-\nready granted Maxwell the supposed relief she seeks\nfrom this Court. Although the District Court did not\nmodify the Protective Order, Judge Nathan authorized\nMaxwell to convey, under seal, to the appropriate ju-\ndicial officer the fact that the Government obtained an\norder from Court-l permiting the Recipient to comply\nwith a subpoena for materials covered by a protective\norder, that Court-2 subsequently denied similar relief\nin another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this in-\nformation (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this criminal mater.” (A. lol-o2). If\nthe “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-\ncation of the Protective Order was to share infor-\nmation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-\nment’s investigative techniques, then her appeal is\nmoot because Judge Nathan has already granted her\npermission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why\nthose facts are not enough.\n\nDespite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-\ngues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-\ncess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her\nright to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As\nalready noted, though, it is a mater of public record\nthat the charges against Maxwell include allegations\nof perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29).

To the extent Maxwell complains\nthat unsealing filings in a civil case may result in un-\nfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, she will\nhave the opportunity to request that the District Court\nestablish practices to help ensure she gets a fair and\nimpartial jury.® If she is displeased with those efforts,\n\n8 Maxwell makes much of the Government hav-\ning moved to intervene and stay the proceedings in Doe\nvu. Indyke, noting that the Government has not moved\nto intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unseal-\ning process. (Br. 29). Maxwell suggests that the Gov-\nernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-\nprincipled” reasons. (Br. 29-3o). Seting Maxwell’s\nconspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.\nMaxwell are in completely different procedural pos-\ntures, which implicate different concerns regarding a\npending criminal case. The later was resolved in 2ol7\nand the determination of what material should remain\nsealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there\nis no more <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to be conducted in the Giuffre case\nand no possible concern to the Government that, for\nexample, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might\nbe deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that\na document may be unsealed through an independent\nprocess before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-\nernment’s investigative focus or techniques.\n\nIn Doe v.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt.

In order to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,\nwhich are not voluminous, to the defense by March l2, 2o2l.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6.

The conditions of her pretrial detention deprive her\nof that right. For over 28o days, she has been held in the equivalent of\nsolitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental condition from\nlack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every l5 minutes by\nlights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate food, the constant\nglare of neon light, and intrusive searches, including having hands\nforced into her mouth in a squalid facility where COVID has run\nrampant. The medical literature is unanimous that such conditions\nproduce mental deterioration, which prevents her from effective\nparticipation in trial preparation.\n\nWorse, even if Ms. Maxwell were able to be fully alert and\nmentally acute, she must review over 2,5oo,ooo prosecution pages on a\nguted computer, which does not have the ability to search, edit, or\nprint.

As we noted in our papers, our client is\n2l not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially\n22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up\n23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to\n24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister\n25 person.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019989.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel3o of 2oo 67\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl originally without prejudice obviously for precisely the\n\n2 proceeding we are having, but it sounded like you were\n\n3 suggesting that her current detention was in some way by design\n4 to prevent you from providing a full picture of her financial\n\n5 situation. Is that the implication you are making?\n\n6 MR. COHEN: No, I am not saying that, your Honor. I\n\n7 am not going that far. What I am saying is, when you have a\n\n8 client who will voluntary surrender, who is staying in the\n\n9 country despite an investigation, and the government instead\n\nlo chooses to arrest her and detain her, that limits in the early\nll instances your access to the client.

Their opinions also state that any\nextradition proceeding would be resolved promptly. (Exs. T-V).\n\n¢ Lack of corroborating evidence. The government represented to the Court that it\nhad “contemporaneous documents,” including “diary entries” in support of its case.\n(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense has nou reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As explained more fully belou, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> contains no\nmeaningful documentary corroboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. As an\nexample, the government produced onl\n3\nThe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n? Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago. She will sign them as soon as legal visits resume.\n3 In a leter dated October l3, 2o2o, we asked the government to provide additional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> including, amon\nother things,\n\nIn light of the serious Brady\ninfractions in recent cases before this Court, and the recent order filed in this case pursuant to Rule 5(F) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (see Dkt. 68), the government’s failure to obtain is curious and\nconceming.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020028.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page a426lo45\n(Nathan, J.)

Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have\nalso received and reviewed the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the government (over 2.7\nmillion pages), which was not available at the initial hearing and which raises serious questions\nabout the strength of the government’s case. As a result, Ms. Maxwell can nou present for the\nCourt’s consideration the additional evidence discussed above in support of her bail application.\n\nIt cannot be reasonably disputed that this new evidence meets the other requirement of\n§ 3l42(f): that it have a “material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020035.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBa3A/ Page age afl26io45\nB. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. Dl reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020044.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISACUMENT D2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page So26Io45\nAccording to a. the security guard on duty that day had seen helicopters flying\nover the house, which he assumed to be the press. V/d.). When the guard saw the FBI\nagents walking up the driveway to the house, he again assumed that they were members of\nthe press. U/d.). Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that the press was on the\ngrounds and approaching the house. (/d.). In accordance with the procedure that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. (/d.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest: she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered. It would make\nno sense for her to try to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020045.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8GoHAENt ISACUMENT/ID2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page SiL26lo45\nIndeed, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of i” (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020050.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT/ID2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page GE26Io45\n\nE. The <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of\n\nthe Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell\n\nAt the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence\nin this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up |by]\ncontemporaneous documents . . . |including| flight records, diary entries, business records,\nand other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted\nthe government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of\ncourse, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the\ngovernment had not yet produced <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nSince then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of\nthousands of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, including the entire initial tranche of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the\ngovermnent represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.’ The <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\ncontains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less\n“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2ooos and the\n2olos, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (l994-l997). These documents\nDaily Mail, “French prosecutors probing Jeffrey Epstein over rape and abuse of children in Paris widen probe to\ninclude Ghislaine Maxwell to see if British socialite was involved in his offending,” (Oct. 25, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-88 7882 5/French-prosecutors-probing-Jeffrey-Epstein-widen-probe-\ninclude-Ghislaine-Maxwell html.\n\n° The defense has not yet completed its review of the over l.2 million documents produced on November 9, 2o2o\nand November l8, 2o2o. This production includes documents and images seized from electronic devices found at\nEpstein’s residences in searches of his residences in 2ol9.

The few\ndocuments in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that pertain to the people we believe to be the three\ncomplainants referenced in the indictment do litle, if anything, to support the government’s\ncase against Ms. Maxwell:\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020053.jpg": "Casesb: 2o-68o o88oHAGN ISSCUMENT D2 FileG6Ba3o/PtagPage BO26o45\n\nIn addition, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> appears to shou that, Dn\n|\n7 the government did not issue subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until\nafter Epstein’s death. Although the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not include the grand jury subpoenas\nthemselves, the subpoena returns appear to indicate that the government began issuing\nsubpoenas for Ms. Maxwell’s financial information on August l6, 2ol9, six days after\nEpstein’s death, and issued additional subpoenas in the months that folloued. The facts\nstrongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms. Maxwell—who was\nnot named in the Epstein indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in\ntheir custody. The lack of corroboration in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> confirms that the case against Ms.\nMaxwell was an afterthought and was reverse engineered based on allegations of 25-year-\nold conduct from a small number of alleged victims.\n\nThus, notwithstanding the statement in the government's bail submission, we have\nbeen provided with no meaningful documentary corroboration in this case. It appears that\nthe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that allegedly took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration only\nreinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and strengthens her\nlong-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear her name in court. This\nfactor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms. Maxwell bail.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020055.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT D2 Fileebka3A/ Pag Page afL26lo45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020056.jpg": "Caseasb:2o-O8oo88oHAEN ISAC UMENT/ D2 FileebRa3o/PtagPage a2267o45\nexaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s oun\nnegligence with respect to Epstein.\"\n\nCounsel has atempted to address the restrictions in numerous leters, emails and calls to\nthe MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel. Follouing\nCourt directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submited a leter that recited BOP policy but failed to\naddress a number of concerns.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020057.jpg": "Casast:2o-S8oo8BoHAEN FSSC UMENT/ON2 Filec6easa/PagPpage aB26jo45\nalerted the government on August 27, 2o2o that there were significant portions of the first three\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions that Ms. Maxwell could not read. (Dkt. 66). Despite numerous atempts\nto fix these problems over the succeeding weeks, including producing a replacement hard drive\ncontaining these productions, the problems were not resolved and the replacement hard drive was\nbroken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same technical problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents. Most recently, the hard drives for the\nsixth and seventh productions have stopped functioning properly. As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus. As reported by the associate warden to the Criminal Justice\nAdvisory Board on December 2, MDC does not mandate testing among its staff. A temperature\ncheck and response to a few questions does litle to detect an asymptomic carrier. The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n'3 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\ntechnical problems. We note, houever, that nou that Ms. Maxwell has been released from quarantine, she only has\naccess to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five days a week, which will effectively limit her review time to that time slot\nbecause of compatibility issues between the recently produced hard drives and the prison computer.\n\n37\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020058.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISACUMENT D2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page aH426lo45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits.

As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\nM4 See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020073.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEctiMert loo2 Filed6R238/?HgPage tl Boaf 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020074.jpg": "Cagseab2 o-6o B8QHAUNnt DEckMNENt loo2 Filedsh238/2hgPageilacat 36\n\nIn addition to corroborating each other, these victims’ accounts are further corroborated by\nother witnesses and by documentary evidence, which has been produced in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. That\nevidence will make it virtually indisputable that these victims in fact met and interacted with both\nthe defendant and Jeffrey Epstein at the times and locations they describe. Po\nevidence, additional witnesses will confirm that both the defendant and Epstein knew and\ninteracted with certain minor victims when those victims were minors. In other words, the\nGovernment’s evidence strongly corroborates the victims’ testimony that they met and interacted\nwith the defendant and Epstein at particular times and in particular places.\n\nIn the instant motion, the defendant complains that the documentary evidence relevant to\nthe three victims identified in the Indictment and produced to date is not sufficiently voluminous\n? In its Renewed Bail Motion, the defense a\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020092.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBtlANt BEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPageB26af 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020093.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctiMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tagPageBR6af 36\ncounsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant\nhas access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020094.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGANnt DEctIMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBataf 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020111.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQC33ouAUNt Bescutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Pagel d Ob l5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden\nA. The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell’s Substantial\nTies to the United States, Including Her Spouse i\n\nThe government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new\ninformation and that the Court was “already aware of” the defendant’s friends and family in\nthe United States. (Gov. Mem. at l3). The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\n|| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding\nthat no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\nAnd the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged\nwith offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of\nthe offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On\nthe other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a\ndanger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The\nDefendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.\n\nAs explained belou, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion\nfor bail nor the evidence she submited in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s\nconclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no\nconditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.\n\nl. The Weight of the Evidence\n\nThe Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant\nargues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness\ntestimony and that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced to date has included only a “small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,\nthat the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July l4, 2o2o bail\nhearing. See id. at3o 33. So she argues that the second § 3l42(g) factor supports release.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on\nthe recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020147.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pagehbos 22\n\nIn light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the\nDefendant’s proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant’s conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s argument that the conditions of her\nconfinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully\ndispute that she has received “more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.” Gov’t Opp’n at\n29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by\nBOP, including a recent lockdoun due to COVID-l9 that curtailed in-person legal visitations,\nthe Detendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her\nconstitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknouledges the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to\nprovide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court\nhas determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.*\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly\nwith her atorneys and to review all necessary <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials to prepare for her defense.\nDefense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests.

The later condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they\ncannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020181.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uMMent/LVP l Fileasasy2 372l9 ePagebl l65l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment.

The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely strengthened\nby Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets\nmonitored by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.\n\nTo find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of a 59-year-old\nwoman with no criminal history, who poses no danger to the community, who has made\nAmerica her home for the past 3o years, and who has established strong roots and forged\nimportant connections with family and friends who reside here, is incredulous. The\nconcerns regarding foreign citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say\nthat renunciation of foreign citizenship and strict monitoring of assets by a retired federal\ndistrict court judge does not suffice when combined with an eight-figure bond secured by\nreal property and cash and the strictest terms of home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring strains credulity.

The visiting rooms in the\nEast Building, where Ms. Maxwell is detained, have been reviewed by an HVAC expert retained by the Federal\nDefenders of New York and have been characterized as a “death trap.” The MDC claims it is in the process of\ninstalling HEPA filters, a request long overdue in light of concerns regarding ventilation in legal visiting rooms\nraised early in the pandemic.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for recreation. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020207.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co838onseIN 3SD6cOMenl45Hl , Bil€GH2ol 6/24 e Pagef 3 Ob 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The defense team therefore has a considerable\namount of catching up to do in a very short amount of time, and defense counsel need to\nimmediately begin meeting with Mr. Robertson on a regular basis. The case is also complex and\nexceedingly serious. The government has named 24 witnesses on its most recent witness list [Doc.\nlo4] and the Court has issued upwards of 3o writen orders over the past three years of contentious\npretrial litigation in this case. And if Mr. Robertson is convicted on all charges, he will be facing\ndecades in prison: according to his Form l3 PSR, Mr. Robertson’s effective guidelines range\nwould be a staggering 4l2 to 485 months of imprisonment, or approximately 34 to 4o years. See\nDoc. l88 at l5.\n\nFinally, defense counsel explained at the recent pretrial conference that it will be\nimpossible for them to effectively prepare the case for trial with Mr. Robertson in custody under\nthe current lockdoun conditions due to COVID-l9. In normal times, defense counsel can meet\nwith their clients face to face in meeting rooms at the jails, where they can review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ndo other critical trial preparation. Nou, houever, if the jails are allouing in-person client meetings\nat all, itis with the defendants separated from their counsel by a screen, making it nearly impossible\nto effectively review documentary evidence. And while defense counsel represented that the Santa\nFe County Detention Center is allouing video meetings by Zoom, it is hard to schedule Zoom time\ndue to the limited number of computer facilities at the jail and the number of parties vying for them\n(including this Court). Defense counsel also represented that while the Zoom meetings have been\nhelpful, the Detention Center has not alloued them to shou Mr. Robertson documents by sharing\ntheir screen, requiring counsel to instead hold the documents up to their computer’s camera in the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020221.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdi BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di3l66l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They\nneed to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if\nnecessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to\nCOVID-l9. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of\nsevere outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdouns to ensure the safety of the\nstaff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States\nMarshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide\nMr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally\nentitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,\nuntil it is safe and practically possible for his atorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is\nno longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.\n§ 3l42(l).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a\nStay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a\nstay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020233.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 56, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o7529l, Page2 of 3\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nwee ee ew ew ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee eee ee x\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : AFFIRMATION\nAppellee, :\n-V.- : Docket Nos. 2l-58, 2l-\n: 77o\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant-Appellant, :\nee. }\nSTATE OF NEW YORK )\nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK : SS.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK_)\n\nLARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l746, hereby affirms under penalty of\nperjury:\n\nl.

The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, l49 F.\nApp’x 4o, 42-43 (2d Cir. 2oo5); United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9, 32l n.7\n(2d Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Vondete, 5 F.

At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

Under these circumstances, Judge Nathan can hardly be said to\nhave abused her discretion by finding that temporary release is not “necessary” for\nMaxwell to prepare her defense. “Temporary release is not warranted when a\ndefendant has had ample time to prepare his defense.” Scarborough, 82l F. App’x\nat 6ol. That is the case here. Maxwell is represented by a team of highly qualified,\nretained counsel, and has resources to prepare her defense far beyond those of the\naverage defendant.

Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law. Rather, “[i]n considering whether there is a ‘compelling reason’\nfor a defendant’s release under [Section 3l42(l)], a court must balance the reasons\nadvanced for such release against the risks that were previously identified and\nresulted in an order of detention.” United States v.

The risks presented by COVID-l9 do not alter this conclusion.\nNot only does Maxwell have no underlying conditions that place her at heightened\nrisk of complications from COVID-l9 (Ex. D at 89-9o; Ex. H at 2l), but she nou\nhas been fully vaccinated (Gov’t Ex. A at l9, 2l).

(Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the\nGovernment has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s\nconditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal during those conversations.\n\nLast week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the\ndefendant is housed tested positive for COVID-l9. In response, the MDC implemented the same\nquarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus.\nSpecifically, on November l8, 2o2o, the defendant was tested for COVID-l9 using a rapid test,\nwhich was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other\nquarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she\nwill be tested again for COVID-l9. If that test is negative, she will then be released from\nquarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-l9.\n\nDuring her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was\nalready housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will\ncontinue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the\ndefendant will be permited out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that\ntime, the defendant may shouer, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.\nIn addition, the defendant will continue to be permited to make legal calls every day for up to\nthree hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where\nno MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel.\n\nOn November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant\nto use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be\npermited to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen hours per day,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020261.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt SieeutreriZ72o 2Ailed l4/23/26 aragef 2 af 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterial. A <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020268.jpg": "Caseabe? o-ce6o8Bt+AU Ant B6camMent 4/28 2 Filed/OVhs/PagPage 22of 2\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Nee Hare IN Tee\n[usocspNy —«”™\nDOCUMENT\nChristian R, Everdell ELECTRONICALLY FILED\n+l (2l2) 957-76oo DOC #:\nceverdell@cohengresset.com DATE FILED: l/l5/2l.\nJanuary l4, 2o2l\n\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court\norder the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the\ngovernment so that she can review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on weekends and holidays.\n\nAt the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop\ncomputer to review the voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, which was produced on a series of external hard\ndrives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends\nand holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\nHouever, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several\ndays of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the\nlaptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July l2, 2o2l trial date, she must\nhave access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays.\n\nDefense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms.\nMaxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the\ngovernment has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to\nrequest that they lift this restriction, but without success.\n\nThere is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to\nthe laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire l4-day\nperiod that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2o2o because she had\ncome into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID.

Given the millions of documents that\nMs. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be\ngiven as much time as possible with the laptop to review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.

The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given\nMDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection\nhad been reiterated to the U.S. Atorney’s Office numerous times.\nDefense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her\naccess to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Houever, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.\nMaxwell to use to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permited to use that\nlaptop to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for thirteen (l3) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the\nGovernment laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers. Although defense counsel\nhas indicated that the MDC Brooklyn <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Despite defense\ncounsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, her consistent use of\nGovernment laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> computers undercuts this claim.\nMoreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three\n(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this ls far more time than any other MDC\ninmate is alloted to communicate with their atorneys.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o27o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020272.jpg": "_ CaSede2oteb®d33ouAEnnt Dibeutrenvl2e lFiked 92ool /2agPiagef Lat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials. Since the Government made its first <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020273.jpg": "CaSede2ot epQO33ouAUNt DipeutenzilZe@ lFiked 624ol /2agPidgef 2 af 2\nPage 2\n\nto the laptop, the Government generally defers to the judgment of the MDC in managing inmates\nat its facility, and sees no reason to depart from that practice here. In this respect, the Government\nnotes that the trial date remains approximately six months away, the BOP was already affording\nthe defendant access to the laptop for some 65 hours a week, and the BOP was further providing\nweekend access to a desktop computer should the defendant wish to spend more than 65 hours\neach week reviewing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nUnited States Atorney\n\nBy: __s/\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020274.jpg": "_ CaSede2otebQd33ouAEnnt DieutrenviBe lFiked O2oo5/24g Pagel Lat 2\noe U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

This update is based on information provided to the Government by\nMDC legal counsel through those communications.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop\ncomputer provided by the MDC on which to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Additionally, pursuant to the\nCourt’s January l5, 2o2l Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by\nthe Government on which to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per\nweek. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-l9 cases within the MDC,\nin-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2o2o. While in-person visits are\nsuspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In\nparticular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.\nIf defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to\nschedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls\ntake place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her\ncommunications with counsel.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC.

The Government admits that it knew where she was. It had such\nconfidence that it could arrest her whenever it chose that it orchestrated\nher arrest to coincide with a press conference replete with incendiary\ndemonstrative aids.

It is no wonder that\ncourts around the country are ordering temporary release under § 3l42()\nfor the few defendants who are trying to prepare for trial during the\npandemic.\n\nThe Government’s weak response is that Ms. Maxwell only\nmentioned temporary release at the first bail hearing.

Ms. Maxwell has repeatedly\npressed her inability to effectively prepare her defense, which ls properly\n\n“To illustrate, for Ms. Maxwell to review the 2.7 million pages, she\nwould have to do it, page by page, on a computer screen.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the disclosure has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”).

But given the nature of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable.

Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell.

Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month.

Relegated to a small “fishboul” where chairs abut glass walls and a table,\nwith no room in between, Ms. Maxwell and counsel are forced to wedge their bodies into chairs.\nThere is no opportunity to view electronic <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or exchange documents; and speaking while\nwearing a face mask while crammed on either side of a plexiglass divider under surveillance of\nthree guards and a handheld camera places a chill on any free exchange of confidential\ninformation.

She has not experienced sunshine and fresh air for\nthe past eight months.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)). The government, ever protective of sensitive items of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that relate to the alleged victims, should exhibit the same concern for Ms. Maxwell’s\nright to privacy.\n\nThe incident of physical abuse which occurred when Ms. Maxwell was shoved into her\nisolation cell to be searched was previously reported to MDC Legal and the Court and\ninvestigated within the facility. The guard responsible for the abuse is a member of a rotating\nteam that has been the subject of complaint, yet some members were reassigned to Ms. Maxwell\nfor the past two weeks. The incident at issue occurred when Ms. Maxwell was facing forward in\nfront of an officer whose back was in front of the handheld camera. On information and belief,\nthe camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by\nciting a video. We request that the Court direct the government to provide defense counsel with\nthat video.

The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020366.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page8 of 24\n“unpersuaded” by Maxwell’s argument “that the conditions of her confinement are\nuniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus\njustify release.” (/d. at 2o).

Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel2 of 9l\nentered on the docket.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury.

The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020495.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page9 of 92\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section.

The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\na manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020499.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel3 of 92\nentered on the docket.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020630.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57, o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel2 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nGovernment as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate logistical arrangements\ncan be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email within 24 hours in advance\nof the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on the question of detention\npending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is\nexcluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the\nDefendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the\nlogistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the\nends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public and the\ndefendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported.\nby the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, which will facilitate the\ntimely production of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in a manner protective of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020634.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nhave no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial.

In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nIn June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell\nwith facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around\nl994 to l997. The Government filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,\nwhich contained only small, ministerial corrections. The $l superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of\nthe Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two\ncounts of perjury in connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to\nbegin on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nMaxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding\nindictment, suppress evidence, and compel <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. After the parties fully briefed those\nmotions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking\ncount and another related conspiracy count.\n\nThis Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than\nthose seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and\nthis Opinion, deal exclusively with the $l superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020761.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel43 of 2o8\nA-l39\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 34\n\nrelated to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell’s motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the\npages that follou:\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court\nconcludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the\nGovernment brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly\ndelay in bringing them.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the\nalternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The\nCourt concludes that the charges are specific enough.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony\nresponded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that\nthese issues are best left for the jury.\n\ne Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can\nproceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will\ntry the perjury counts separately.\n\ne Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous\nand to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that\nthese motions are premature before trial.\n\ne Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories\nof evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will\norder Maxwell and the Government to confer on a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> schedule.\n\ne Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than\nManhatan, returned the $l superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhatan\nreturned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o76l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020767.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel49 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 34\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020779.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 34\nto describe the windou of when a violation occurred.” United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d\n364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir.\nl987)). “This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse\nof underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses.” United States v.\nYoung, No. o8-cr-285 (KMK), 2oo8 WL 4l78l9o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2oo8) (collecting\ncases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time,\nand witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when\nabuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct.\n\nMaxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges\nimpermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the\nindictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of\nthe crime. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The language of the Sl superseding indictment does so.\nThe Government’s decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is\nnot inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of the\ncharges.\n\nFinally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not\nprovide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged\nvictims’ names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally\nneed not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United\nStates v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l27 (2d Cir. 2ol3); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364,\n369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Maxwell likely knous the identity of the alleged victims described in the\nindictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on them.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o779\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020781.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel63 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d.\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\nye.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020782.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel64 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\nreasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the “inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately\npresented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joming all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o782\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020787.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel69 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 34\n\n(PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting cases). The Court therefore\ndenies Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\nVIL. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures\n\nMaxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it\nhas in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the\nGovernment’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator\nstatements, and Rule 4o4(b) material. Based on the Government’s response in briefing and\nleters the parties have since submited to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have\nbeen overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not\nentitled to expedite this <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will\nrequire the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all\n\nBrady and Giglio Material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v.\nUnited States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain\nevidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under\nGiglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also\ninformation that could be used to impeach a key government witness.” United States v. Coppa,\n267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). Asa general rule, “Brady and\nits progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material\nupon request by a defendant.” /d. at l46. “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in\ntime for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law\nsimply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.” /d. at l44.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020789.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020790.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel72 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020791.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel73 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference.

Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021079.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page32 of ll3\nuntenable reading without even granting Defendant’s request for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> or a\nhearing to determine the scope of the agreement.\n\nTo support its creative reading of the NPA, the court relied on U.S. v.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). That case warrants close\natention. In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment\nin the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and\npossessing heroin with intent to distribute. See 77l F.2d at 67l. After they pled\nguilty to the substantive importation charge, the prosecutor represented to the court\nthat “the only agreement that exists between defendants and the Government is that\nat the time of the imposition of sentence ..., the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts...”. /d. Accordingly, the conspiracy and\npossession counts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were\nindicted in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to distribute heroin.\nSee id. Whereas the dismissed EDNY charges had only alleged a conspiracy on or\nabout a date in l982, the new SDNY charges alleged criminal conduct extending\nfrom l982 to l985. The defendants argued that these new charges were barred by\ntheir plea agreement with the USAO-EDNY. See id. The court conducted an\nevidentiary hearing—obtaining testimony from both the prosecutor and the defense\natorney from the Eastern District proceedings—and concluded that the agreement\nwas not meant to bind the USAO-SDNY.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.| OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8.

See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.l. The Defendant opposes both the unsealing\nand releasing the questionnaire to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will\nundoubt[edly] color Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture.” Maxwell Br. at 53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in\nlimiting Juror 5o’s access and opposes maintaining the questionnaire under seal. Gov. Br. at 42;\nsee also Dkt. No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his completed questionnaire. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his completed questionnaire—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\nquestionnaire must be docketed. Juror 5o’s and the Defendant’s request that the questionnaire\nremain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

I am\n\nrequesting that the trial date be postponed to sometime in October or a date\n\nthereafter that is convenient for the Court.\n\nThe adjournment is necessary to ensure that Ms. Noel receives adequate and effective\n\nassistance of counsel.

Firstly, the government in this mater sent out\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on or about December 3l, 2ol9. It was received in my office over the holiday break\nwhen no one was working.

Accordingly, I have had only about two weeks to review the\nvoluminous <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> provided.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> ostensibly contains approximately 25,ooo documents and hundreds of\nhours of video footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I will need at least an\nadditional 6o days to review the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and discuss it with my client. Thereafter, I will still\nneed to conduct an investigation based on the information and witness statements detailed in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Such an undertaking will take at the minimum another 6o days. As the Court can see,\nit will take me 9o days or more before I am in a position to knou what additional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> may\nbe needed or what motions are appropriate.

Noel and Thomas,\nl9 Cr. 83o (AT)\n\nDear Judge Torres:\n\nThe Government respectfully writes in response to the defendants’ leters of January 27,\n2o2o, requesting at least a six-month adjournment of the trial date in the above-captioned case,\nwhich is currently scheduled to commence on April 2o, 2o2o. The Government remains prepared\nto proceed to trial as scheduled. As is set forth more fully belou, while the Government has no\nobjection to a brief adjournment of the trial date subject to the Court’s availability, the requested\nsix-month adjournment is both unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nBy way of background, as is set forth in the Indictment, the charges in this case relate to a\nperiod of just over l4 hours—from approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately\n6:3o a.m. the follouing day, August lo, 2ol9. The Government has made three <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nproductions—(l) the main production on December 3l, 2ol9; (2) a small supplemental production\non January 23, 2o2o; and (3) a reproduction of video surveillance footage with timestamps on\nJanuary 24, 2o2o.' While the December 3l, 2ol9 <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production consisted of a large\nnumber of pages of materials, many of those materials were produced principally in anticipation\nof defense requests and to help facilitate the very sort of broader investigation the defendants nou\nclaim they need to undertake. For example, the Government produced MCC video surveillance\nfor a period of longer than one month (July 5, 2ol9 to August l2, 2ol9); count slips for nearly\nthree weeks (July 23, 2ol9 to August l4, 2ol9); thirty-minute round reports for more than a month\n(July l, 2ol9 to August lo, 2ol9); and materials relating to the events of July 23, 2ol9. Similarly,\nwith respect to defendant Noel, the Government provided in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to her only a report from\nher cellphone, which consists of more than 2o,ooo pages, very few of which, if any, are relevant\nto the pending charges. For substantially the same reasons, and as the Court is aware, the\n' For the third production, the Government requested additional hard drives from defense counsel.\nTo date, only Noel’s counsel provided a hard drive to the Government, which the Government\nthen loaded and returned to counsel. The Government stands ready to do the same for Thomas as\nsoon as a hard drive is provided.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021999.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 22 Filed ol/28/2o Page 2of3\nJanuary 28, 2o2o\nPage 2\nGovernment also produced 35oo material for every individual interviewed during the investigation\nin December, nearly four months in advance of trial.\n\n‘Whether or not to adjourn a trial date is traditionally within the discretion of the trial\njudge.” United States v. Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022005.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 26 Filed o2/lo/2o Page 2ofl5 2\nkllu2NoeC kjc\nl (Case called)\n2 THE COURT: Good morning.

We are asking that the\n2o trial date of April 2o, 2o2o, be moved to sometime in October\nal or a date thereafter that's convenient to the court. The\n22 reason for the request is because it is necessary in order to\n23 provide an adequate and effective assistance of counsel.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment,\nCount Four at 7 l5.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the\nindictment.\nB. Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a protective order as to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9. (ll/25/2ol9 - Docket Minute Entry).\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022030.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 7 of 38\nThis refusal is perplexing and nonsensical because these same government prosecutors presented\nthe defendant with a consent to search document from the office of the Inspector General. (See\nExhibit C.)\n\nThis motion concerns the defense requests for production of documents regarding\nimportant and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with\ninformation that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of Iefitey Epstein. (See article atached as Exhibit D.)\n\n| Additionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive\ninvestigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). The United States Atorney\nGeneral, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons commissioner, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer\nboth made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth\ninvestigation into the Bureau of Prisons’ policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a\ndirect result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August lo, 2ol9. (See Exhibit D.) This\nreport is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is\nmaterial and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant’s assertion that staffing issues,\nstarfing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go\nto the heart ofhis defense to the government’s criminal allegations.\n\nThe government’s response to Mr. Thomas’ <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> request was not detailed and\nsunply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal\njustification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to\nthe items originally requested by his counsel. |\n\nCc. The Inspector General’s Report and Any Other Reports, Documents,\n\nand/or Memoranda Made by Other Federal Agencies Investigating the\nIncident Surrounding the Death of Jeffrey Epstein Are Discoverable and\nMust Be Produced\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022031.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 8 of 38\nAs stated previously, there is no dispute that multiple investigations by numerous federal\nagencies were opened to investigate the events surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein on\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Michael Thomas is charged with certain crimes resulting from this same event. .\n. On August lo, 2ol9, the Washington Examiner, reported under the headline: “Barr announces\nDOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death.” (See Exhibit D.) On December 28,\n2ol9, Reuters reported under the headline: “FBI investigating Jeffrey Epstein’s inner circle.”! On\nSeptember ll, 2ol9, CNN reported under the headline: “The Jeffrey Epstein investigation was\nmore expansive than previously thought, documents shou.” This news clip refers to what\nappears to be a separate investigation by the U.S. Marshals Service. On the Wikipedia page ,\n| entitled, “Death of Jeffrey Epstein,” the follouing appears, among other information: “After\ninitially expressing suspicion, Atorney General William Barr described Epstein’s death as ‘a\n. perfect storm of screw-ups.’ Both the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General\nare conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death.*”\nD. The Information Sought by This Motion.\nIn the minute entry on the docket, of November 25, 2ol9, this Court noted, among other\nthings, “The Government shall produce <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> to the defense by December 3l, 2ol9.” This\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> was not produced. Because the government has failed to meet the disclosure mandates\nof Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio, this motion seeks to compel the government to produce the\n; follouing: l) Inspector General’s report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein and the Bureau\nof Prisons’ policies and procedures; 2) any reports, witness statements, memorandum, and\ndocuments from any separate investigation conducted by the BOP; and 3) any reports, witness\nstatements and/or documents created by any other federal agencies that investigated the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein that have not already been disclosed.\n: See.

The report of the Inspector General, as to both defendants, including, any\nand all supporting memorandums, writen statements, photos, videos, and\nincident reports\n\nThe defendant is entitled to complete disclosure of the Inspector General’s report.\nMoreover, Mr. Thomas has a right to any and all information obtained in this investigation. Not\nonly is it possible that this report contains additional witness statements but this report also has\n. information that has not been furnished by the government in any capacity previously. Moreover,\n_ While the government would like to limit its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligation to reports, videos and\ndocuments related specifically to night and early morning hours of August lo, 2ol9, the defense\nsubmits that there is a much larger context that lead to those events and the charges against\nMichael Thomas. Indeed, the Atorney General of the United States and the “acting”\ncommissioner of the BOP opened an investigation that was precipitated by the events of August\nlo, 2ol9 but said investigation was much more expansive and in-depth. In November 2ol9, the\n, “acting” commissioner Kathleen Hawks Sawyer stated at a congressional hearing under oath that\nthere were more than 33oo vacancies within the BOP and she was surprised that the BOP was\nable to function with nth issues. She went on to state that: “The vast majority of staff are good,\nhardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched.” (See article atached as\nExhibit E.) The broad depth of the Inspector General’s report presumably was that there were a\nmyriad of systematic issues affecting the BOP that alloued the events of August lo, 2ol9 and\nthe death of Jeffrey Epstein to occur. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to disclosure of any\nand all of this information, especiaily if it relates to his defense of the charges that have been\ninitiated, It is the defendant’s contention that this report may also contain Brady-Giglio material.\nIndeed, the prosecutors in this case may be denying the defendant his right to this material\nwithout any knouledge of its contents. If so, this is a dereliction of their duty and denies Mr.\n\nThomas important rights that are the foundation of our judicial system.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022033.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page lo of 38\nDe Any and all internal investigative reports created by the BOP as to both\ndefendants, including, any and all supporting memorandums, writen\nstatements, photos, videos, and incident reports\n| To date, the government has disclosed a multitude of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> documents but those\n\ndocuments only relate to witness statements, video and incident reports concerning the events of\nAugust lo, 2ol9. Michael Thomas would like this court to authorize the disclosure of any and all |\nreports generated by investigators within the Bureau of Prisons regarding the August lo, 2ol9\nincident, if those have not been disclosed. Additionally, the defendant seeks any all documents,\nreports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have\nengaged in the same or similar conduct. Mr. Thomas requests the results of any disciplinary\nproceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding the discipline or administrative ~\nadjudication of any other employees who have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts. More\nspecifically, the defense is aware that there was an almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6\nwherein officers failed to conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited\n\n. suicide. The defense believes that only one of four officers in that case was given only a minor\n(l4) day suspension. Moreover, although the government will argue that this incident is far\nremoved from the current incident, the defendant disagrees. Mr. Thomas knew some of the\nindividuals in that incident and he was well aware that their conduct did not lead to their\nindictment or incarceration. In fact, many of those officers did not receive as much as a\nreprimand for falsifying the same documents that Mr. Thomas is nou charged with a federal\ncrime for submiting. This goes to Mr. Thomas’ defense in this case. The defendant’s state of\nmind is always a material and relevant fact in any criminal case. Indeed, the mens rea for U.S.\nCode § lool is that the party knouingly and willfully made the false statement.

The Complete Inspector General’s Report, as Well as the Other Reports\nRequested Are Necessary for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense\n. Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.l99l) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F.\nSupp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4) Numerous federal districts have repeatedly ruled that “evidence\nis material under Rule l6 as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022036.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l3 of 38\nin uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation, corroborating testimony, or\nassisting impeachment or rebutal.” United States v.

Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 35o, 356 (S.D.N. ¥.2oo7) (quoting United\nStates v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 35l (D.C.Cir.l993)).

Mr. Thomas contends that the conduct with which he\nis being charged is: l) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with knouledge and acquiescence\nby the leadership of the BOP; and 3) is the direct result of BOP policies and mismanagement that\nforced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is nou being charged criminally.\nMoreover, the information sought in this motion is crucial to the preparation of Mr. Thomas’\ndefense. For instance, Mr. Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the\nMCC in August of 2ol9 led to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is nou criminally charged. If\nthe Court accepts this representation, then the Court should find that the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests\n| contained in this motion are “material” and must be disclosed. As support for this position the\ndefendant has atached an excerpt from a union commitee meeting that was held merely 3 days\nbefore Jeffrey Epstein died at MCC on August lo, 2ol9. The atached memorandum\nmemorializes a meeting atended by Jermaine Darden, the captain of the MCC, wherein he was\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022038.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l5 of 38\ngovernment agencies because it is highly relevant to Mr. Thornas’ defense in this case.\nFurthermore, the government had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the\nInspector General’s office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government tumed over the results of\nthis search in the normal course of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production. This fact shous that the Inspector\nGeneral was investigating this incident thus all information they receive is discoverable. This\nCourt should order the production of the documents within forty-five (45) days from the entry of\nan order on this motion.\n\nB. Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Include the Production of Documents and —\n\nReports Generated by Other Agencies\n\nThe facts, shoun above as reported in the media and secondary sources, clearly shou that\nother agencies were involved in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein’s death and the defendant’s\narrest and indictment. Thus, clearly, this Court should not permit the government to selflimit\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. A prosecutor is not \"alloued to avoid disclosure of evidence by the simple expedient\nof leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another agency while utilizing his access to\nit in preparing his case for trial.\" United States v. Trevino, 556 F.2d l265, l272 (5th Cir.l977);\n\nU.S. v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4)\n\nIn United States v. Bryan, 868 F.2d lo32 (9th Cir.l989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 858, llo\nS.Ct. l67, lo7 L.Ed.2d l24 (l989), after a nationwide investigation by the IRS, Bryan had been\nconvicted of, among other things, conspiracy to defraud the United States. Bryan sought\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, under Rule l6(a)(l)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges\nagainst Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further\nobjection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the\nmater was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government’s objection.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022039.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l6 of 38\n\nBryan argued, conversely, that the ‘government’ under the Rule, included not only the\nprosecutors, but also any closely connected investigative agencies. The Court dispensed with the\n‘out of District’ argument by the government, ruling that Rule l6 was not so limiting.\n\nWith respect to the issue of production of items from other closely connected agencies,\nthe Court found in favor of Bryan as far as <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of items by such agencies. In seting forth\nthe rule, the Court said: “The prosecutor will be deemed to have knouledge of and access to\nanything im the possession, custody and control of any federal agency participating in the same\ninvestigation of the defendant.” Jd.at lo36.\n\nThe District Courts of New York have folloued Bryan, supra. In United States of\nAmerica v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 2o4 (E.D.N.Y. l999), also a corrections/police officer case,\nthe Court found that the materials were discoverable from any other agencies “allied with the\nprosecution.” Jd. at 2l, In addition, in citing to Bryan, supra, the Court stated that: “Another\nfactor in the analysis is whether or not the prosecution has access to the materials.” fd\n\nIn this mater, defendant, Thomas, has shoun that other agencies ‘allied with the\nprosecution,” have and/or are, participating with each other. The statement of Atorney General,\nWilliam Barr, confirms that a separate investigation was initiated by the Inspector General.\nAdditionally, it seems more than obvious that the internal affairs division within the BOP\nconducted a separate investigation into the events in questions. Importantly, Rule l6 focuses on\nthe preparation of the defense. Therefore, documents are material under Rule l6 and subject to\ndisclosure if they help the defense to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s\ncase. Marshall, l32 F.3d at 67-68.\n\nOther Districts have also folloued Bryan. In United States v. Libby, 432 F. Supp. 8l\n(D.D.C. 2oo6), the Court was faced with a motion to compel, by defendant, I. ‘Scooter’ Libby, in\nthe Valerie Plame CIA leak case. The mater concerning Libby concerned whether he lied as to\nthe disclosures as to Plame. Libby sought documents which, as the Court pointed out, were of a\n\n: 42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022040.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Pagel7 of 38\nfar-reaching nature, including documents related to a revenge issue as to Valerie Plame, and her |\nlate husband, Ambassador Wilson. The Court in Libby ruled in favor for the defense and granted\nthe motion to compel discavery in several key areas of the case. ,\nThis Court will find Libby, supra, important because the Court’s decision in that case\nfocused on “all agencies” that have information regarding the offenses charged. In the instant ,\n| mater, therefore, it will not be enough for the government to state that other agencies may not be\nallied with the prosecution, or that the government lacks access to the documents. If the\n| documents provide exculpatory evidence, and are related to the issues in the indictment, they\nmust be produced.\nIn Marshall, l32 F.3d at 63, the defendant was charged in a drug related transaction.\nThere were records on visitation from the local jail where the defendant was incarcerated, pager\nrecords, the pager, and local records from the county public records about a traffic stop. These\nitems were uncovered by the government agents investigating the mater, but only after\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> had been concluded. During the course of the trial, the Court took a four-day\nadjournment, in order to address the newly discovered evidence. The trial judge decided to\nexclude all of the newly discovered evidence, and, as a result, Marshall was found guilty. On\nappeal, the government argued that, in fact, the newly discovered evidence, under Rule l6,\ntended to incriminate, not exculpate Marshall. On appeal, the Court disagreed, citing Rule\nl6(a)(l)(C} as requiring the production of items that are material to the preparation of the\ndefendant’s case. The Court, in addition, rejected the government’s argument, that the items\nmust be ‘materially exculpatory,’ Jd. at 68. In announcing the rule, that Court stated: “In United\nStates v. Lloyd, we said that evidence is material under Rule l6 ‘as long as there is a strong\nindication that it will play an important role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness\npreparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting impeachment or rebutal.” See Lloyd at 35l.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022041.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l8 of 38\nUndoubtedly, the government is going to assert that the requested documents in this\nmotion are not relevant or material and do not bear on the charges as they relate to the conduct\nthat did or did not take place on August lo, 2ol9. The documents sought are material if they will\nhelp the defense with trial preparation tasks such as evaluating the strength of the government’s\ncase, investigating possible defenses, finding additional relevant evidence, and developing\nstrategies to impeach government witnesses. See United States v. Safavian, 233 F.R.D. l2\n(D.D.C. 2oo5) It is not up to the government to define Mr. Thomas’ defenses to the indictment or\nto determine what is useful in preparing them.\nFor these reasons, this Court should include the requirement of the production of both\ninculpatory and exculpatory evidence in any order granting this motion to compel.\nAt this juncture, houever, the government has made, at best, a token objection to the\n| <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> by citing to a terse denial made at a previous court appearance.\nMr. Thomas, therefore, cannot guess what may be other objections, but this Court should\noverrule any such atestations as going against fundamental fairness.\nC. The Reports and Documents Requested Are Discoverable Under Bradv\nThis motion has articulated several rationales ypon which the defendant in this mater is\nentitled to much more information than the government is voluntarily willing to disclose. The\ngovernment’s disclosure obligations do not end with Rule l6. Much of the <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> sought by\nthis motion is firmly rooted within the scriptures of documents that must be disclosed under the\ndoctrine set forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963), and its progeny.\nUnder Brady, the government has an affirmative duty to produce any evidence favorable\nto the defendant that is material to cither guilt or punishment. See United States v. Bagley, 473\nU.S. 667, 674-75 (l985) (the prosecution is required “to disclose evidence favorable to the\naccused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial”). Both exculpatory\ninformation and evidence that can be used to impeach the prosecution’s witnesses are considered\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022042.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l9 of 38\n“favorable” under Brady and must be disclosed by the government. Jd. at 676-77; see also Giglio\nv. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54-55 (l972); In re Sealed Case No. 99-3o96 (Brady\nObligations), l85 F.3d 887, 892 (D.C. Cir. l999). Moreover, the defense is already in possession\nof witness statements that one or both of the defendants in this indictment may have conducted\nrounds or inmate counts on August lo, 2ol9. Accordingly, there is a logical assumption that\nthere might be additional exculpatory statements contained in the Inspector General’s report or\ncertain internal reports maintained by the BOP internal affairs division or other government\nagencies that were conducting a contemporaneous investigation with FBI.\n\nThe prosecution must produce to the defense not only all favorable evidence that is\nadmissible, but also all evidence “that is likely to lead to favorable evidence that would be\nadmissible.” Safavian, 233 at l7 (quoting United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 2d ll96, ll98-\n99 (C.D,Cal, l999)). Just as with Rule l6 disclosure, the government must interpret its Brady\nobligations broadly. “Where doubt exists as to the usefulness of the evidence to the defendant,\nthe government must resolve all such doubts in favor of full disclosure.” fd. (citing United States\nv. Paxson, 86l F.2d 73o, 737 (D.C. Cir. l988). Without question, the Brady disclosure\nobligation is broader than Rule l6 because it requires production not just of documents, but also\nof information knoun to the government that has been documented in some fashion.\n\n. In Safavian, the court explained the materiality standard under Brady that applies to\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>: .\n[T]he government must always produce any potentially\n\nexculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to hou\nthe withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the\nbenefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial. The\nquestion before trial is not whether the government thinks that\ndisclosure of the information or evidence it is considering\nwithholding might change the outcome of the trial going forward,\nbut whether the evidence is favorable and therefore must be\ndisclosed.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022043.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 2o of 38\nid. at l6 (citing cases); see also United States v.

(Dkt. No. 33) (“Mot.”). Thomas seeks an order\ncompelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable\nunder any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas’s motion is\nentirely without merit and should be denied.!\n\nThomas concedes that the Government has produced a “multitude” of <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> directly\nrelevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his\npurported defenses, namely, that he commited the offenses because of staffing issues and\nsupervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (l) a\ncopy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General\n(“DOJ-OIG”), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary\nmaterials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2ol9 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (i) reports\nand documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and other agencies who were not and\nare not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (il) reports and documents related to “any\nand all [Metropolitan Correctional Center (““MCC”)] employees” who have engaged in “the same\nor similar conduct,” including an incident in “2oo5 or 2oo6” where officers failed to conduct\ncounts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and\ndocuments related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP\n\n' Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas’s pretrial\nmotions. See Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(c)(3) (“Ifa party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule\nl2(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely. But a court may consider the defense, objection, or\nrequest if the party shous good cause.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022069.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 7 of 34\npolicies which relate to the “much larger context” at the BOP (Mot. 6, 7, 9, lo).\n\nAS an initial mater, the Government has satisfied its Rule l6, Brady, and Giglio obligations\nand is not in possession of the additional materials that Thomas seeks. More importantly, Thomas\nis not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate\nreasons. First, the records are not “material” to preparing a defense because they are wholly\nirrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to\nnullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the “possession”\nof the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect\nmaterials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were\nnot part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no\nlegal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-\nOIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they “falsif[ied] the same\ndocuments,” (Mot. 6), because he has uterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to\nprosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\nThomas’s motion should be denied in all respects.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nl. The Indictment\n\nIndictment l9 Cr. 83o (AT) (the “Indictment’) was filed on November l9, 2ol9, charging\ndefendants Tova Noel and Michael Thomas in six counts: (i) conspiring to defraud the United\nStates and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSection 37l (Count One); and (i) five counts of making or using a false writing or document, in\nviolation of Title l8, United States Code, Sections lool(a)(3) and 3 (Counts Two through Six).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022070.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 8 of 34\nBoth defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged\nin Counts Two and Three. The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period,\nfrom approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day,\nAugust lo, 2ol9, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As\ncharged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated\ncounts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false\ncertifications atesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the\nSHU were conducted from approximately lo:3o p.m. on August 9 to 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nI. Pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Production\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022071.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 9 of 34\nnotes. On January 3o, 2o2o,°? the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with\ntimestamps, and on March l6, 2o2o, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic\ndevices and a photograph of a text message.\n\nB. Defense Requests for Additional <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> Materials\n\nThe defendants have made a number of requests for additional <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> materials, in\nresponse to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with\nRule l6 and its other disclosure obligations, as described belou.\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November ll, 2ol9, Thomas, through counsel, raised\nthe issue of an “ongoing . . . report” by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the\n“status” of the report and when it would be completed.* (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2ol9, at 3-4, 7-9).\nIn response, the Government explained that “to the extent counsel’s asking for a summary of the\nresults of the criminal investigation, obviously we’ll be turning over in <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> all of the\nunderlying results of the criminal investigation. . . . I don’t have a time frame on the [I]nspector\n[G]eneral report, but the [G]overnment will produce to the defense all of the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nmaterials in this mater, which includes the Rule l6 materials relevant to the criminal charges that\nhave been brought against the defendants.” (/d. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve,\nthe Court declined to rule at that time.\n\nOn January 29, 2o2o, Thomas and Noel each submited <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> requests to the\nGovernment.

The Requested Records Are Not “Material” to Preparing a Defense and Are\nSought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification\n\nAll of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not “material to preparing a defense”\nunder Rule l6, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the\nGovernment’s false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, l4). Thomas is not\nentitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—\nthat would aid in that nullification effort because Rule l6 only entitles a defendant to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>\nfor purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the\ndecision to prosecute.\n\nl.

Applicable Law\n\nAs described above, Rule l6, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government’s\n“possession.” As a general mater, while “[a]n individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have\nknouledge of all information gathered in connection with his office’s investigation of the\ncase, .. . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does\nnot in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge to the prosecutor.” United States v.\nAvellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations omited). The imposition of such “an\nunlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor’s office\non the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government’\nthat would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.” Jd.

Thus, <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and disclosure\nobligations only extend “information knoun to persons who are a part of the ‘prosecution\nteam’ ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of\nthe case,” including “police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the\nprosecutor and participate in the investigation.” United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App’x 36, 38 (2d\nCir. 2ol5) (citation omited). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information\nin the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense.

Yousef, 327 F.3d\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022086.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 24 of 34\n\nee Discussion\n\nAs described above, the Government has produced Brady, Giglio, and Rule l6 material in\nthe possession of the prosecutors and agents at the United States Atorney’s Office, the FBI, and\nthe DOJ-OIG who have worked on this investigation and prosecution. Thomas seeks materials\nthat are not in the possession of the United States Atorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI\nand DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.\n\nThomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the\nprosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic\ndecisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the\nMCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and writen\nrequests to the MCC’s legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any\ninternal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide. Notwithstanding\nthose facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the\npossession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is setled law in this\nCircuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or\ncontrol of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint\ninvestigation” with that agency. None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022087.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 25 of 34\nGovernment; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel\naccompanied the prosecution to court proceedings.\n\nMoreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into\nthe events of August 9 and lo, 2ol9 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe\nthat most if not all of the records that he seeks—such as records of other instances of BOP\nemployees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP’s investigation. There\nis simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the\npossession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case,\nregarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct\nrequired rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other\ntimes also allegedly falsified records.\n\nThe cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the\nNinth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> obligations to documents\nlocated in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS\ninvestigation. 868 F.2d lo32, lo35-37 (9th Cir. l989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit\nexplained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might\nhave documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule l6’s disclosure requirements are cabined\nto anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the\ndefendant.” /d. at lo36 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d\n2o4, 22l (E.D.N.Y. l999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> motion, that\n“TcJourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrouly to mean the prosecutors in the\nparticular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant,\nand not the ‘government’ in general.” And while the court in United States v.

Supp.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022089.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 27 of 34\nsuch, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas’s motion can be denied on that\nreason alone. Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the\ndeliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532\nU.S. l, 8 (2ool) (quoting V.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 42l U.S. l32, l5o (l975)). The\nprivilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> under the deliberative\nprocess privilege); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C.

Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot.

As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022092.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3o of 34\none,” id., as the defendant must “overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of\nfederal prosecutors, and ‘in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they\nhave properly discharged their official duties.’” United States v. Sanders, l7 F. Supp. 2d l4l, l44\n(E.D.N.Y. l998) (quoting Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 464), aff'd, 2ll F.3d 7ll (2d Cir. 2ooo).\n\nA defendant claiming selective prosecution must present “clear evidence” that the decision\nto prosecute not only (l) “had a discriminatory effect” but was also (2) “motivated by a\ndiscriminatory purpose.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l73\n(2d Cir. 2oo3); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. l992); United States v. Moon, 7l8\nF.2d l2lo, l229 (2d Cir. l983). “The discriminatory effect prong requires a shouing that\n‘similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted.’” Alameh, 34l\nF.3d at l73 (quoting Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited; alteration\nincorporated). Where a defendant “has not shoun that the Government prosecuted him because\nof” his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. /d.\n\nIn order to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer\n“some evidence tending to shou the existence of the essential elements of the defense.”\nArmstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 5ol F.2d l2o7, l2ll (2d Cir. l974));\nUnited States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2oo2) (per curiam) (to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>, a defendant\naccordingly first “must shou some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022093.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3l of 34\nintent”); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). “[T]he shouing necessary to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> should itself\nbe a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 464.\n“Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient” to meet this\nburden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 47o (affidavits “recount[ing]\nhearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not sufficient to\njustify <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>); Berrios, 5ol F.2d at l2ll (affidavit from defendant and atorney that they\n“‘believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went\nunprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 34l F.3d at l74 (defendant’s statistical analysis was\ninsufficient to merit <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on selective prosecution claim).\n\nDe Discussion\n\nThomas is not entitled to <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> that would relate to a selective procession or\n“discriminatory application” claim. He has not carried his burden through a shouing of any\nevidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.\n\nAs to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any\nevidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of\nconduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal\nquotation marks omited). “A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who\nhas commited roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom\nthe law has not been enforced.” United States v. Lewis, 5l7 F.3d 2o, 27 (lst Cir. 2oo8). Thomas\nalleges that there was an “almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6 wherein officers failed to\nconduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited suicide,” and one of the four\nofficers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to\nconduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022094.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 32 of 34\nthose officers “in 2oo5 or 2oo6” did falsify count slips, Thomas has still not put forth any evidence\nthat those officers were “outside of the protected class,” meaning of a different race, gender,\nnationality, or other protected class than Thomas. In any event, even were the conduct similar,\nthat Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally\nprosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas points to the fact that “Officer-l” and “Officer-2” in the Indictment,\nwho falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. institutional counts on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, respectively, were not prosecuted. (Mot. lo; Ind. ¥[ l5, l7, l9). Even assuming\narguendo that Officer-l and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified\none count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that\neither Officer-l or Officer-2 were outside of a “protected class” to which Thomas belongs.’ Nor\ncould he: Officer-l and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas\nalso questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas’s\nfalse count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or\npersonnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false\nstatements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the “suspicion [and]\nsurmise” contained in Thomas’s motion simply do not constitute “objective evidence” warranting\n<span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d l6, l9 (2d Cir. l992) (conclusory allegations as to\ntiming of indictment, Government’s failure to follou internal guidelines, and improprieties of\n\nT Tn so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or\nthe exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas’s\nclaim that the lack of charges against Officer-l, Officer-2, or Thomas’s supervisors is in and of\nitself sufficient to meet the defendant’s burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated\ndefendant who was not charged.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022095.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 33 of 34\nprosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span>); Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l23o (“to engage\nin a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or\nsurmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

Contrary to\nBOP training for new Lieutenants, which she atended in 2oll, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\ntold the OIG, “We are not required to go to each individual cell and look at the inmates.

Epstein’s Death on August lo\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> of Epstein Hanged in Cell and Emergency Response\nOn August lo, 2ol9, shortly after 6 a.m., the doorbell to the SHU rang, indicating that a delivery of breakfast\ncarts had arrived at the SHU. Noel and Thomas retrieved the breakfast carts from the double-locked\nentrance to the SHU and brought them inside the SHU. At the time, Thomas and Noel were the only officers\nin the SHU. At approximately 6:3o a.m., MCC New York security camera video recordings shou Noel and\nThomas walking touard the L Tier. Noel and Thomas told the OIG that at this time they were entering the\nL Tier, in which Epstein was housed, to deliver breakfast to the inmates. As discussed previously, between\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, the OIG did not observe\non the available recorded video any COs or other individuals approach the L Tier where Epstein was housed\nfrom the common area of the SHU.\nNoel told the OIG that she unlocked the door to the L Tier so Thomas could deliver the breakfast trays.\nThomas told the OIG that he knocked on Epstein’s cell door, saw a portion of Epstein through the windou\nbut could not make out what he saw, so he said to Epstein, “Come to the door, come to the door.” Thomas\nsaid he did not observe any movement or hear a response, so he unlocked the cell door, entered the cell,\nand saw Epstein hanged as described further belou. Thomas said he immediately yelled for Noel to get\nhelp, and that Noel activated a body alarm, signaling a medical emergency, and began taking the steps\ndescribed belou.\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span> of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing <span class=\"highlight\">discovery</span> of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.\n\n5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to\nseveral days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.\n83\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023790.jpg": "RE: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 763l8-o54\nFrom\nTo\nDate 2ol9/o7/3o l5:2l\nSubject: RE: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, reg. no. 763l8-o54\n; TEXT-.htm, Revised Atorney Electronic <span class=\"highlight\">Discovery</span>\nAT CRAs Material kb_l.docx\nPage 3o59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2379o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030432.jpg": "NN Ss ns. ee ell ee PAGE o2/82\n:3l l56l355735l _ SP .\no2/o5 AReUS-ZUUB TUK o2!36 PM FAK NC.
