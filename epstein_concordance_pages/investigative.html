These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> challenges posed by COVID.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations.

In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo).

Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool732", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 53 Filed o9/o8/2o Page 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review.

The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 2 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J.

The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and disclosure obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the disclosure of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material.

The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 5of8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 7\n\nAlthough the Government does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails\nsent or received by atorneys at the USAO-SDFL as part of their separate, prior investigation, the\nGovernment nonetheless intends to gather and review the emails sent to or from Atorney-l to the\nextent those emails were preserved and gathered by OPR. As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or\nreview any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n%* %* XK\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will\ncontinue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants disclosure in this case, including\nin connection with its production of Giglio and 35oo material.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool793", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page l of 7\n2) Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nJeffrey Pagliuca\nHADDON\nMook oe N l5o East loth Avenue\nSOUS ee be Denver, Colorado 8o2o3\nPH 3o3.83l.7364 Fx 3o3.832.2628\nwww.hmilaw.com\njpaglisca@hmfilaw.com\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nAt the initial conference in this case, the Government promised Ms. Maxwell and the\nCourt that it would review and produce “prior <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> files from another investigation in\nthe Southern District of Florida,”! which it characterized as part of “the core of the case” against\nMs. Maxwell,” after a “careful and exhaustive and through review of all of the materials,” with\nthe “bulk” of the discovery produced by “the end of this summer [2o2o].”? Summer is gone,\nWinter is coming, and the Government has failed to make good on its promises.\nAlthough it casts the October 7, 2o2o leter to the Court as a “response to the Court’s\nprior inquiry regarding” its plan to produce discovery, the Government is, in fact, abandoning the\ndeadlines to which it already agreed and reneging on (or redefining) its assurances to the Court\nthat it would engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of questions and issues with\nrespect to actively retrieving any appropriate files.” In fact, the promised “substantial”\nproduction of discovery is “substantial” in size, not substance. Approximately one fourth of the\nproduction relates to materials gathered in civil litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was a party. The\nremainder of the discovery contains documents from the 2ooos that relate largely to Jeffrey\nEpstein and therefore have nothing to do with the time period of the conspiracy charged in the\n!

Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 4\ninvestigation. The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v. Teman, No. l9-CR-696\n(PAE), 2o2o WL 3o34o34, at *43 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2o2o) (citations omited), see also, Bagley\nv. Lumpkin, 798 F.2d l297, l3ol (9th Cir. l986); United States v. Librach, 52o F.2d 55o, 554\n(8th Cir. l975).\n\nThe Government is the Team\n\nIn an atempt to minimize what it promised, the Government redefines who it believes is\non the Team. The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record\nassurances that it gave the Court on July l4, 2o2o:\n\n“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> files\n\nfrom another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. l2:lo-l3\n\n“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at\n\nthe New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned and photographed to\n\nmake sure that a comprehensive review can be conducted, and they are physically in New\n\nYork so that we can have access to those files.” Jd., l4:lo-l4\n\nNou, the Government seeks to distance itself from its oun files, which are in New York,\nnot Florida, by arguing that they are excused from reviewing or producing information because it\n6 Pursuant to this Court’s practice standards regarding discovery, Ms. Maxwell, on October l3, 2o2o, sent a detailed\nleter requesting the production of discovery materials under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972). The Government has yet\nto respond.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter. Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files.

Despite repeated requests, the government refuses to produce any\nevidence. Without knouing the who, what, when, and why of these allegations, the task of\nidentifying dead and missing witnesses, percipient witness, travel records, phone records, or\ntemporally relevant documents is challenging and limited by the vagueness of the claims. For\nexample, the government produced part of its voluminous 2oo6 <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> case file\nconceming these issues. The names of the alleged witnesses, the agents who conducted the\ninterviews and the agents who conducted the investigation are, houever, redacted. Ms. Maxwell\nhas no ability to conclusively identify these individuals much less interview them and therefore\ncannot represent to the Court whether they are alive, remember anything, or have useful\nevidence. By withholding this information, the government is purposefully preventing Ms.\nMaxwell from fully litigating this issue and presenting a defense.\n\nWhat we knou, so far, houever, will be sufficient to establish prejudice. Potential\ndefense witnesses are dead, missing, otherwise unavailable, or unable to recall key events\nclearly.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 22\ndecision in Martindell v.

In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIL. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2633", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002634.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of l4\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.°\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n. The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2634", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48-5 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2 of 2\nDOCUMENTS RELATED TO DEFENSE MOTIONS\n\nl.

Lovasco, 43l\nU.S. at 79o. The defendant’s motion fails because she has not demonstrated the other necessary\nelement to prevail: that the claimed delay by the Government was intentional and deliberate to\ngain a strategic advantage. Here, as in Lovasco, any pre-indictment delay was the result of the\nGovernment’s continuing investigation of the case. The Lovasco Court held that the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ndelay did not deprive the defendant of his due process rights and noted that imposing a duty upon\nprosecutors to file charges as soon as probable cause exists “‘would have a deleterious effect both\nupon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.’” Jd. at 79l (quoting\nUnited States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. ll6, l2o (l966)).\n\nThe same is true in the present case. The defendant has not shoun—and cannot shou—\nthat the Government caused any pre-indictment delay in this case to gain a tactical advantage. The\ndefendant argues that “[t]actical, reckless, and bad faith motives can reasonably be inferred from\nthe way the government has ignored evidence, delayed any prosecution, enlisted partisan lawyers\nto do its bidding, circumvented established precedent to illegally obtain evidence, and\nmisleadingly quoting banal testimony so that it could be labeled ‘perjury.’” (Def. Mot. 7 at l5).\nBut rhetoric aside, the defendant offers nothing beyond baseless speculation in support of her\nclaims.\n\nThe defendant claims a twenty-six-year delay on the part of the Government in bringing\nCounts One through Four and a four-year delay as to Counts Five and Six. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4).\nThat is not so. The USAO-SDNY opened its investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators in\nlate November 2ol8. See Section IV, infra. Epstein was charged by indictment on July 2, 2ol9.\nThereafter, the Government continued its investigation, which included interviewing two victims\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ol5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003016.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 82 of 239\n(Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-3) for the first time. In particular, Minor Victim-l first agreed\nto be interviewed in September 2ol9, and Minor Victim-3 first agreed to be interviewed in August\n2ol9.7! The Government conducted multiple additional interviews of both victims, as well as\nother witnesses, and took additional <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps over the next several months before it was\nprepared to seek an indictment charging the defendant. Those two victims were critical to the\ninvestigation, as they helped form the basis of the charges in the Indictment, which the Government\nsought on June 29, 2o2o, less than a year after the victims came forward. That period of time—\nand, in particular, less than one year between when key victims came forward and the Indictment\nwas obtained—cannot possibly give rise to a colorable due process violation.” See Cheung Kin\nPing, 555 F.2d at lo72 (finding that “the government is not responsible for a period of delay during\nwhich an important witness is unavailable to it” and describing the delay as the period between the\nwitness’s cooperation and the date of indictment); United States v.

As noted above, two\nkey witnesses who helped give rise to the instant charges did not agree to speak law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9, facts that significantly undercut the notion that the Government was intentionally\nsiting on a criminal case against the defendant for any meaningful period of time.

The USAO-SDNY Commences the Instant Investigation in 2ol8\n\nOn or about November 29, 2ol8, the USAO-SDNY initiated its investigation into Epstein\nand possible co-conspirators, and formally opened the investigation by completing the requisite\npaperwork to open an investigation on or about November 3o, 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction. See Julie K. Broun, “Even\nfrom Jail, Sex Abuser Manipulated the System. His Victims Were Kept in the Dark,” Miami\nHerald (Nov. 28, 2ol8).*!_AUSA-l was not involved in the decision to open the investigation or\nin the investigation itself. (See Ex. 4 at 6). Indeed, AUSA-l stopped serving as the Office’s\nHuman Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator as of April 2ol7.\n\nShortly after initiating the investigation, the prosecutors involved in the investigation\nlearned of the prior February 2ol6 meeting and requested copies of AUSA-l’s notes and records\n3l Indeed, on July 8, 2ol9, at the press conference follouing the arrest of Epstein, Geoffrey S.\nBerman, then United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York, stated that while he\nwas not “going to go into any aspects of hou our investigation originated[,] I will say that we were\nassisted from some excellent <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> journalism.”\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v.

It does not suffice to shou\nthat the government created the opportunity for the offense, even if the government’s ploy is\nelaborate and the engagement with the defendant is extensive.” (internal citations omited)). The\nSecond Circuit has “yet to identify a particular set of circumstances in which government\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> conduct was so egregious that it shocked the conscience and violated fundamental\nguarantees of due process.” United States v. Heyward, No. lo Cr. 84 (LTS), 2olo WL 4484642,\nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2olo); see also United States v.

DiGregorio, 795 F. Supp. 63o,\n635 (S.D.N.Y. l992).

In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory\nevidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this\nrepresentation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be\ndenied.\n\nFifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the\nGovernment to produce copies of a// subpoenas it has issued for the defendant’s records as part of\nits investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. lo at ll). This incredibly broad request is nothing more\nthan a fishing expedition inappropriately seeking the details of <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> requests made through\nthe grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government\nto provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other\nmaterials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the\ndefendant’s records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of\nrequests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the\ndefense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable\nmaterial that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In\nthe absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the\nreasons discussed above in Sections I and I'V, the defendant is not entitled to discovery or a hearing\nrelating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress\nsubpoena returns.\n\nSixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any\nBrady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. lo at ll-l3).

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 348\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.*®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7 of 348\n2.

Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 348\nD.

On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo325o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 348\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAUGUST 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7. I have conferred\nwith U.S. Atorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of\nincarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,\nhe is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\nSincerely,\nR.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo326o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 348\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !“°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'* When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.'°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “‘to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\noo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l9 of 348\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also recetved a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3424", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 275 of 348\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI. DEPARTMENT POLICY: THE 2oo5 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR\n\nVICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2oo5 GUIDELINES)\n\nIn 2oo5, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to\nincorporate the provisions of the CVRA. The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “‘to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA.

Responsible officials must advise a victim\npursuant to this section at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which\nit may be done without interfering with an investigation. To comply with this\nrequirement, it is recommended that victims be given a printed brochure or card\nthat briefly describes their rights and the available services, identifies the local\n249\nDOJ-OGR-oooo345l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3464", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 289 of 348\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> records; court transcripts; <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3of6\n\ne AK’s recollection is that the atorneys did not make any suggestions regarding what\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps SDNY should take. The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\nJustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case.

For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and\nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a\nmodel scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.\npassports for young girls to “work” as models.

(Dkt. No. 2o7).\nA. Overview\nThe Government takes its discovery and disclosure obligations seriously, and it has\nendeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the\npendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its discovery and\ndisclosure plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks\nAct obligations with respect to the materials already in the possession of the prosecution team, but\nthat it also makes reasonable efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the\nfiles of other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was\nformulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3955", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\nalso noting what the Government has not done and does not believe it is obligated to do with\nrespect to materials that are potentially related to the NPA.\nB. The Prosecution Team’s Files\n\nAs the Court is aware, the charges in this case arose from an investigation opened in 2ol8\nand conducted by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\n(“SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York\nPolice Department (“NYPD”; collectively, the “Prosecution Team”).

The\nGovernment has obtained the full <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file from the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident Agency\n(the “FBI Florida Office”), which conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein between 2oo5 and 2olo (the “FBI Florida File”), and whose file also contained the\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file for the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) related to that same\ninvestigation (the “Florida Investigation”). The Government has reviewed and produced all Rule\nl6 materials, including potential Brady material, contained within the Prosecution Team’s Files,\nincluding the FBI Florida File and the PBPD file. The Government has not identified anything\nwithin the files of the Prosecution Team, the FBI Florida File, or the PBPD file that constitutes\nBrady material with respect to the NPA.\n\nC. The Government’s Collection and Review of Other Agencies’ Files\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the Government submited a leter to the Court seting forth its plan\nfor collecting and reviewing certain files from other agencies with potential relevance to this case.\n(Dkt. No. 63). Although Second Circuit law did not require the Government to do so because\nthose other agencies were not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government endeavored to collect\nand review certain of those materials as part of its commitment to go above and beyond its\ndisclosure obligations. (/d. at 4). In particular, the Government noted its intention to collect: (l)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3957", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page 7 of l4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

First, BSF admits that these communications occurred. Second, the\ncommunications about trying to get Ms. Maxwell indicted were “prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation or for trial,” admiting both relevance and admissibility.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time).

AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved.

See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 349\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.*®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8 of 349\n2.

Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 75 of 349\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nSee Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\na As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4372", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 85 of 349\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAuGust 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7, I have conferred\nwith U.S. Atorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of\nincarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,\nhe is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\nSincerely,\nR.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4382", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 87 of 349\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll7 of 349\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order.

As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.'°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “‘to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\noo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4423", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein.

The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ... to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafa\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4477", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22o of 349\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation.

FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4546", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 276 of 349\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI. DEPARTMENT POLICY: THE 2oo5 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR\n\nVICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2oo5 GUIDELINES)\n\nIn 2oo5, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to\nincorporate the provisions of the CVRA. The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA. Investigation Stage\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency’s responsibilities begin with the report of the crime and extend\n\nthrough the prosecution of the case. In some instances, when explicitly stated, the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency’s responsibility for a certain task is transferred to the prosecuting\nagency when charges are filed.\n\n2. Identification of Victims. At the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at\n\nwhich it may be done without interfering with an investigation, the responsible official of\n\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency shall identify the victims of the crime.\n\n3. Description of Services.\n\na. Information, Notice, and Referral\n(l) Initial Information and Notice. Responsible officials must advise a victim\npursuant to this section at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which\nit may be done without interfering with an investigation. To comply with this\nrequirement, it is recommended that victims be given a printed brochure or card\nthat briefly describes their rights and the available services, identifies the local\n249\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4573", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 289 of 349\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4586", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29o of 349\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.\"!3\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne § Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafaia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\noa According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4587", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l4 of 349\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> records; court transcripts; <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 26\n\ntime the defendant was indicted in July 2o2o or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was indicted in 2ol9.\nSpecifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in or about 2oo7 in\nconnection with a prior investigation conducted by the USAO-SDFL, Minor Victim-4 did not\nagree to be interviewed by the prosecution team handling this case until July 2o2o. The\nGovernment then conducted two preliminary interviews with Minor Victim-4 by video\nteleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the difficult nature of the interview topics,\nhouever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4 over video. Due to travel\nconstraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic, the Government was unable\nto travel to meet with Minor Victim-4 until late January 2o2l, at which time the Government\nconducted multiple in-person interviews with Minor Victim-4. The Government then took\nadditional <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps and sought the S2 Indictment in late March 2o2l, approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges. Any suggestion that the Government\nintentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in\nfact. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay, much less an\nintentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nFinally, the defendant again asks the Court to “defer consideration of this motion until\ntrial.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The Court should again reject the defendant’s invitation to defer ruling\non this motion. See Apr. Op. at l8 (denying motion but allouing renewal of motion if the “factual\nrecord at trial shous otherwise’); see also United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS), 2olo WL\n289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order. Permissive |\nintervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |\nprotective order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na protective order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o |\n(2d Cir. l986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |\nTel.

For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations.

To Be Filed Under Seal |\nand that such an order should not be vacated or modified merely to accommodate the |\nGovernment’s desire to inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal |\ninvestigation[.]” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.\nSince Martindell, “It is well-setled [in this Circuit] .. . that a Rule 26(c) protective order |\n\nmay be overturned or modified [only] based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary |\ncircumstances or compelling need.” Andover Data Servs., a Div. of Players Computer, Inc. v. |\nStatistical Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir. l989). Moreover, the Second Circuit |\nhas held that Martindell applies to the Government, as well as to any other third party seeking to |\nmodify a protective order. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229 n.7. |\nThe Government argues that Martindell should not apply to the instant application, for |\n\nthree reasons. (Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-5.) |\nFirst, it argues that the rule of Martindell is inapplicable because here the grand jury |\n\nissued a valid and proper subpoena to Boies Schiller, while in Martindell the Government “‘was |\nproceeding outside of its usual <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> pouers to secure the requested testimony, not by |\ngrand jury subpoena,’ Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422.” (See Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-4.) Houever, the |\nstatement from Davis that is quoted above concerned the testimony of a non-party appellant |\nwhose testimony was not subject to a Rule 26(c) protective order, but rather to an informal )\n“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing. Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. |\nThe opinion underscored that the parties’ unwriten understanding about the confidentiality of\nthis deponent’s testimony would not trump a formal grand jury subpoena. That discussion is |\nirrelevant to the question of whether this Court is required to apply the Martindell rule in |\nevaluating this application. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo884 |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4934 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004936.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l3 of 27\n: To Be Filed Under Seal\n\na grand jury subpoena, with which the party (the defendant) complied. At no point did the\ndefendant seek relief from the protective order. Id. When the other party to the protective order |\nlearned of the defendant’s blatant disregard of its obligations, it moved for sanctions in the civil |\naction. Id.\nThe district court condemned the defendant’s behavior as “entirely unnecessary and |\ninappropriate,” but nonetheless refused to sanction the defendant—apparently because, had the |\ndefendant sought relief from that order, the judge would have granted its request. Jd. at 93-94, |\nWhile the Martindell factors were never mentioned expressly by the district court, Judge |\nBroderick observed that the confidentiality order did not implicate “technological trade secrets, |\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which |\ncould benefit rivals”—factors that, if present, he would have had more difficulty balancing |\nagainst the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> needs of law enforcement. Id. at 94. |\nThere are three reasons why Chemical Bank does not justify this Court’s refusing to |\napply the Martindell factors to the Government’s application. First and foremost, the opinion of ,\nanother district judge does not trump an opinion from the Second Circuit. Second, while a reader |\nof Chemical Bank cannot be certain whether the district court complied with Martindell, the |\n|\nlanguage quoted above certainly suggests that the district court engaged in the balancing exercise |\nthat Martindell contemplated. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the Government’s |\ninvestigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I will return later |\nin this opinion. |\nThe Court will, therefore, analyze the Government’s request in light of the Martindell |\nfactors. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo886 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4936 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—\nthat caused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related |\nApplication.” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5.) |\nTo be sure, the convenience of having potentially incriminating testimony readily |\navailable does not in and of itself rise to the level of an extraordinary circumstance. In )\nMartindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |\n“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the maters in connection with |\nwhich the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |\ngrand jury <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |\nthe mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 4o |\nF.3d 592 (2d Cir. l994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :\nshouing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |\none day invoke the Fifth Amendment at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |\nprosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |\ncivil proceeding]... [.] Prosecutors often make do without the testimony of a defendant.” Jd. at |\n595-96 (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296). |\nHere, houever, the extraordinary amount of publicity surrounding all aspects of what I |\nwill call the Epstein mater does create practical limitations to the grand jury’s ability to secure |\ncertain information with the secrecy it requires to conduct an appropriately thorough and |\nthoughtful investigation. Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a situation in |\nwhich the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |\nindependently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743. This is not a case, like United States v. :\nOshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696, 7o3 (S.D.N.Y. l988), where the Government was trolling for evidence\n24\nSDNY_GM_ooooo898 !\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4948 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding. See also Botha y. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97-cv-7587, l998 WL 88745, at\n*3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb, 27, l998) (“[I]he Government may not use its ‘awesome’ <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> |\npouers to seek modification of a protective order merely to compare the fruits of . . . discovery |\nin a civil action with the results of a prosecutorial investigation in a cdinaital action.”). |\nAdditionally, the Government is not on a fishing expedition, merely hoping to inspect the |\nprotected materials for possible use in a future criminal investigation. In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, |\nl99l, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the bankruptcy examination, which |\nincluded deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”).

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo (l974), to justify these additional subpoenas.\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\nrequirements of a Fed. R. Crim. P. l7 subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o\n(S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nI. The Additional Subpoenas\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks to serve Rule l7 subpoenas on the follouing law firms and\n\nindividuals. The subpoenas seek specific items each identified in their respective Atachment A:\nl. Annie Farmer (Ex. l)\n\n2. Maria Farmer (Ex. 2)\n\n3. Brad Edwards, Esq. of Edwards Potinger (Ex. 3)\n\n4.

Request\n\nMs. Maxwell filed various pretrial motions which are currently pending before the Court.\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that one or more of her pending motions will require the presentation of\nevidence, that certain evidence central to the accusations in this mater will need to be examined\nin advance of trial as part of the investigation of her defense, and that the requested evidence is\nadmissible at trial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks production of these materials in advance of\ntrial. She makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in favor of an ex parte”\nprocess and because she is providing detail regarding her <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> and trial strategy to\ndemonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility requirements of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nIt is well-established that the Court may order that the materials should be produced to\ncounsel’s office, rather than to the courtroom itself. See, e.g., United States v. DNRB, Inc., No.\n4:l5-cr-o362, 2ol7 WL 28o625l, at *3 (W.D. Mo. June 27, 2ol7) (directing production to\nrequesting party); United States v. Jewell, Crim. No. 4:o7-cr-oolo3, 2oo8 WL 387l736, at *3\n(E.D. Ark. Aug. l5, 2oo8) (directing third-party to produce nonprivileged responsive material to\ndefendant’s counsel). Once delivered to counsel's office, the materials are not automatically\nrequired to be shared with the government. Whether they are required to be shared is determined\nby other applicable rules, e.g., Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b).\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 362 Filed lo/2o/2l Page4of4\n\nWashington, DC 2ooo5\n\n(2o2) 795-93oo\n\nktounsend@rcfp.org\nThe Miami Herald The National Press Club\nAmerican Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

First, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court protect the dignity and privacy of victims by\npermiting certain witnesses to testify under pseudonyms or using only their first names, and\npermiting the filing of related trial exhibits under seal. Second, the Government moves to admit\nprior consistent statements made by the minor victims in this case. Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with irrelevant and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors. In particular, the Government moves to preclude the defense from calling\nagents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), in an improper effort to put the\nGovernment on trial. Fourth, and relatedly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npreclude the defense from offering argument or evidence at trial in support of the defense’s\nunfounded theory that the Government is prosecuting the defendant for nefarious reasons. Fifth,\nthe Government moves to preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the credibility of\nindividuals who will not be witnesses at trial. Sixth, consent is not a legal defense in this case,\nand the defense should be precluded from suggesting to the jury that the victims consented to\ntheir abuse. Seventh, the Government requests that the Court require the defendant to explain the\nrelevance of any evidence she seeks to offer shouing that she did not commit crimes with which\nshe is not charged, before she offers that evidence or makes argument based on that evidence.\nEighth, the Government requests that the Court preclude the defense from offering out-of-court\nstatements by the defendant, which are hearsay. Ninth, the Government moves to preclude the\ndefense from offering irrelevant evidence to garner sympathy for the defendant. |\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5396", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 54\ninvestigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2ol9 indictment against Epstein\nand a 2o2o indictment against the defendant.\n\nThe defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging\ndecisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of54\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No 293 Ex. A). Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\nenforcement agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an extensive sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 54\nhearsay. See id. at 246 (majority op.) (charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination\nonly “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *l-2 (precluding cross examination of\nagent regarding district atorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).\n\nThe Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are irrelevant,\nhearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5423", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5426", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o-l Filed lo/29/2l Page2of3\n| COHEN & GRESSER LLP Nea irk IEE\nChristian R.

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is irrelevant?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is irrelevant? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps” with “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 69\nparticular “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique” to prepare its case. See United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4\nF.3d 5o, 52-53 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order); United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary\norder); United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May\n22, 2ol9). We do not intend to violate that rule.\n\nNevertheless, conducting a shoddy investigation is not an “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique.” As\npreviously discussed, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence and argument challenging the\n“thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at\n445; see also id. at 446 (citing Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense\nlawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”)\nand Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42 (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”).\n\nAs the people with the most knouledge of the scope and progress of the investigations,\nthe case agents are the most appropriate witnesses for the defense to call to explore these topics.\nAnd because the government has assiduously avoided calling them in its case-in-chief, the\ndefense must call them in its oun case. It is meritless for the government, at this stage of the\ncase, to try to preclude entire topics or areas of questioning, or to preclude the defense from\ncalling the case agents at all. The Court should not permit this. If particular questions to the\ncase agents are objectionable, those objections can be addressed at trial.\n\nE. A Proffer Regarding the Basis for the Case Agents’ Testimony is Unnecessary\n\nand Unwarranted\n\nThe government asserts that the defense should be precluded from calling the case agents\nas witnesses unless and until it provides a proffer identifying a “proper basis for their testimony.”\nGov’t Mot. at 32-33. The defense already did so in its Jouhy leter and the government has cited\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382-7 Filed lo/29/2l Page4of7\n\ne AK’s recollection is that the atorneys did not make any suggestions regarding what\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps SDNY should take. The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case. AK asked\n\n3\nSDNY_GM_o2742889\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5549", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 4o\nUnited States v.

Carton, No. l7 Cr. 68o (CM),\n2ol8 WL 58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charged crimes. See United States v. Duncan,\nNo. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (“The length of the\ninvestigation, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially\na target of the investigation are all irrelevant pursuant to this principle.”); United States v.\nAleynikov, 785 F.

The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About Irrelevant\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v.

May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is irrelevant); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39l Filed lo/29/2l Page4ofll\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell commited the charged crimes between l994\nand 2oo4.

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III). Accordingly, if the defense plans\nto call case agents for such testimony—which the Court should preclude—the defense must\nprovide expert notice of such testimony.\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5867", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 29\nll6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946).

First, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court protect the dignity and privacy of victims by\npermiting certain witnesses to testify under pseudonyms or using only their first names, and\npermiting the filing of related trial exhibits under seal. Second, the Government moves to admit\nprior consistent statements made by the minor victims in this case. Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with irrelevant and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors. In particular, the Government moves to preclude the defense from calling\nagents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), in an improper effort to put the\nGovernment on trial. Fourth, and relatedly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npreclude the defense from offering argument or evidence at trial in support of the defense’s\nunfounded theory that the Government is prosecuting the defendant for nefarious reasons. Fifth,\nthe Government moves to preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the credibility of\nindividuals who will not be witnesses at trial. Sixth, consent is not a legal defense in this case,\nand the defense should be precluded from suggesting to the jury that the victims consented to\ntheir abuse. Seventh, the Government requests that the Court require the defendant to explain the\nrelevance of any evidence she seeks to offer shouing that she did not commit crimes with which\nshe is not charged, before she offers that evidence or makes argument based on that evidence.\nEighth, the Government requests that the Court preclude the defense from offering out-of-court\nstatements by the defendant, which are hearsay. Ninth, the Government moves to preclude the\ndefense from offering irrelevant evidence to garner sympathy for the defendant. |\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6363", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 54\ninvestigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2ol9 indictment against Epstein\nand a 2o2o indictment against the defendant.\n\nThe defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging\ndecisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the\nGovernment that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning\nthe scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\ntaken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews\nthey conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”\n(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests\nand prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over\nthe course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and\ncenter” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).\n\nThe Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (l) charging decisions in\ncriminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those\ndecisions, and (2) the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken during the current and prior investigations,\nincluding the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely\nwithin its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the\nGovernment has no obligation to use any particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique. The Court should\nnot permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshou that would\nsignificantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the\ndefense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6382", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 54\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6385", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No 293 Ex. A). Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\nenforcement agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an extensive sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 54\nhearsay. See id. at 246 (majority op.) (charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination\nonly “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *l-2 (precluding cross examination of\nagent regarding district atorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).\n\nThe Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are irrelevant,\nhearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6393", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page2of3\n| COHEN & GRESSER LLP Nea irk IEE\nChristian R.

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is irrelevant?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is irrelevant? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is irrelevant? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps” with “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 69\nparticular “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique” to prepare its case. See United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4\nF.3d 5o, 52-53 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order); United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary\norder); United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May\n22, 2ol9). We do not intend to violate that rule.\n\nNevertheless, conducting a shoddy investigation is not an “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> technique.” As\npreviously discussed, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence and argument challenging the\n“thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at\n445; see also id. at 446 (citing Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense\nlawyers is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”)\nand Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42 (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”).\n\nAs the people with the most knouledge of the scope and progress of the investigations,\nthe case agents are the most appropriate witnesses for the defense to call to explore these topics.\nAnd because the government has assiduously avoided calling them in its case-in-chief, the\ndefense must call them in its oun case. It is meritless for the government, at this stage of the\ncase, to try to preclude entire topics or areas of questioning, or to preclude the defense from\ncalling the case agents at all. The Court should not permit this. If particular questions to the\ncase agents are objectionable, those objections can be addressed at trial.\n\nE. A Proffer Regarding the Basis for the Case Agents’ Testimony is Unnecessary\n\nand Unwarranted\n\nThe government asserts that the defense should be precluded from calling the case agents\nas witnesses unless and until it provides a proffer identifying a “proper basis for their testimony.”\nGov’t Mot. at 32-33. The defense already did so in its Jouhy leter and the government has cited\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439-7 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4of7\n\ne AK’s recollection is that the atorneys did not make any suggestions regarding what\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps SDNY should take. The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because experienced FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case. AK asked\n\n3\nSDNY_GM_o2742889\nDOJ-OGR-oooo65ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 4o\nUnited States v.

Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous irrelevant topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is irrelevant); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page4ofll\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell commited the charged crimes between l994\nand 2oo4.

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents identified\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III). Accordingly, if the defense plans\nto call case agents for such testimony—which the Court should preclude—the defense must\nprovide expert notice of such testimony.\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

Farhane, 634 F.3d l27 (2d Cir.\n\nl9 2oll).\n2o Third legal principle: There is no per se bar on\n2l admiting evidence of the government's charging decisions.\n22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- \"inquire into\n23 its relevance and probative value to the respective case.\"\n24 United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235 (2d Cir. 2ol2); see also,\n25 United States v. Ngono, 8ol F.App'x. l9 (2d Cir. 2o2o).\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page l9 of l27 l9\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl the other individual. Watson, 64o F.3d, 5ll-l2.\n\n2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges\n3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a \"common method of\n4 undermining a prosecution\" by, for example, cross-examining\n\n5 officers on which leads they folloued and which they did not.\n\n6 See, for example, Gray v. Ercole —-— I don't have that full\n\n7 quote —--— 2oll WL 5o82868 (E.D.N.Y 2oo8). Or defense counsel\n\n8 may, on cross, examine investigating officers if they\n\n9 considered alternative suspects. United States v. Birbal, 92\nlo CR 98, l996 WL l92924 at *7, that's the District of the\n\nll Vermont, l996. That was affirmed by the Second Circuit at ll3\nl2 F.3d l23o. And I will quote here, \"The length of the\n\nl3 investigation, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques used, and the fact\nl4 that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\nl5 investigation are all irrelevant pursuant to\" the principle\n\nl6 that the government's failure to use particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nl7 techniques does not tend to shou that the defendant is not\n\nl8 guilty. See, for example, United States v. Duncan, No. l8 CR\nl9 289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9); see also, United States\n2o V. Aleynikov, 785 F.Supp.2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll).\n2l The other two cases the defense cites, neither of\n22 which is binding on the Court, don't suggest anything different\n23 than the law I just referred to. In Bouen v. Maynard, the loth\n24 Circuit held that Brady evidence in the government's possession\n25 was material because it suggested that another likely suspect\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2o of l27 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of l27 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007074.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 23 of l27 23\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl is the relevant basis for the jury's determination of guilt or\n2 innocence. Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 29 of l27 29\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl THE COURT: (Continuing)\n\n2 I imagine this can be done through cross—-examination\n\n3 questions if the witness has personal knouledge. I would also\n4 encourage the parties to discuss stipulations in this regard to\na provide the jury any necessary and non-prejudicial context or\n\n6 background, or other proposals for permiting the jury to\n\n7 understand the background or context without crossing over into\n8 the 4o3 prejudice line.\n\n9 I also would permit the defense to cross-examine law\nlo enforcement officers about the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps that were\n\nll taken if the government puts the thoroughness of the\n\nl2 investigation into issue as this, too, would be permissible\n\nl3 impeachment and cross.\n\nl4 These articulated lines of cross-examination of\n\nl5 government witnesses would be relevant to impeach a witness by\nl6 suggesting bias or otherwise implicating their credibility.\n\nl7 Moreover, denying Ms. Maxwell these lines of questioning would\nl8 have implications under the confrontation clause. The Court\n\nl9 expects that the probative value would not be substantially\n2o outweighed by 4o3 prejudice if done along the lines of what I\n2l have indicated, especially if accompanied by a limiting\n22 instruction by the Court that, for example, prior inconsistent\n23 statements are to be considered for their impeachment value and\n24 the like.\n25 Similarly, the Court may instruct the jury that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007194.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel5oofl58 l5\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl have been involved in motor vehicle accidents or traumatic\n\n2 loss, for example.

And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims.

King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 9 of 24 2l\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl The defense also seeks to elicit evidence of the\n\n2 public outcry and scrutiny that preceded the decision to charge\n3 the defendant. The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page ll of 24 23\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl is the relevant basis for the jury's determination of guilt or\n2 innocence. Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a black or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l7 of 24 29\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl THE COURT: (Continuing)\n\n2 I imagine this can be done through cross—-examination\n\n3 questions if the witness has personal knouledge. I would also\n4 encourage the parties to discuss stipulations in this regard to\na provide the jury any necessary and non-prejudicial context or\n\n6 background, or other proposals for permiting the jury to\n\n7 understand the background or context without crossing over into\n8 the 4o3 prejudice line.\n\n9 I also would permit the defense to cross-examine law\nlo enforcement officers about the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps that were\n\nll taken if the government puts the thoroughness of the\n\nl2 investigation into issue as this, too, would be permissible\n\nl3 impeachment and cross.\n\nl4 These articulated lines of cross-examination of\n\nl5 government witnesses would be relevant to impeach a witness by\nl6 suggesting bias or otherwise implicating their credibility.\n\nl7 Moreover, denying Ms. Maxwell these lines of questioning would\nl8 have implications under the confrontation clause.

Any inquiry will be\nfocused primarily on the testimony of Juror 5o. The proposed redactions reduce the risk that his testimony\nwill be tailored based on a preview of information central to the inquiry or otherwise tainted by outside\ninformation and influence. The proposed redactions pertain to the follouing information:\n= Juror 5o’s exact responses to the questions on his jury questionnaire, which is being kept\ntemporarily under seal. See Dkt. 596 at 5, fn l.\n= Data about the responses of other jurors and potential jurors to the jury questionnaire.\n= Details of <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps the defense has taken and evidence uncovered thus far.\n= The defense’s view of the underlying facts.\n= The scope of the defense’s requested discovery in advance of the hearing.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury selection the multiple prospective jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or harassment. These redactions are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed redactions address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch redactions.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed redactions are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested discovery in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of redactions.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed redactions to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009175.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihfexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad de WAd A2predatdr Apay Man fontite\nISEMENT —_—_—Privacy Policy | Feedback Wednesday, Jan 26th 2o22 lPM 3o°F 4PM 29°F —_—5-Day Forecast\nDaily Mail\ncom\nHome | U.K. Sports | U.S. Shoubiz | Australia | Femail | Health | Science | Money | Video | Travel | Shop | DailyMailTV\nADVERTISEMENT\ni | e e. es s T\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:\ne e I ! e\nMaxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex\ntrafficker and reveals his oun abuse ordeal\n* Scoty David , a juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the l2 men and women who convicted Maxwell\non five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week\n¢ Scoty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all\nI've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein.

Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals identified on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page4of7\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 7o2.\nDef. Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page5of7\ninvestigation are all irrelevant” to Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. /d. at l9 (quoting United States v.\nDuncan, No. l8-CR-289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9)). The Court concludes that the\nexpected topics of Gershman’s testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nbeing neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims—all fall within the rubric of atacking\nthe thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt of the\ncrimes charged. In short, this testimony would run afoul of the instruction that the jury will\nreceive that “the government is not on trial.” /d. at 23 (quoting United States v. Knox, 687 F.\nApp’x 5l, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7)).\n\nThe Court notes that a court in this district recently excluded Gershman’s testimony in a\ncivil case in which he would have similarly criticized the SEC’s investigation, including the use\nof cooperating witnesses. SEC v. Collector’s Coffee Inc., No. l9-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2o2l\nWL 34l8829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2o2l). That case differs from this one in several respects, but\nthat court’s basic reasoning informs and supports the Court’s decision here.\n\nThe Defense argues that the Court “expressly denied” prohibiting the Defense from\ncalling an expert witness like Gershman. Def. Br. at l7. Tellingly, the Defense quotes no\nlanguage from the Court for this proposition and instead cites only those pages of the Court’s\noral ruling in which the Court explained that it “will permit relevant cross-examination of the\ngovernment’s witnesses.” Nov. l Tr. at 27. This language in no fashion supports the Defense’s\nrequest to admit an expert to testify about government <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques. The Court\nreiterates, houever, that it will permit the Defense to pursue “lines of cross-examination of\ngovernment witnesses [that] would be relevant to impeach a witness by suggesting bias or\notherwise implicating their credibility,” which could include the Defense’s theory of witnesses’\nmotives for “implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein’s death.” /d. at 28-29.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page6eof7\n\nSecond, even if Gershman’s testimony was relevant, Rule 4o3 prejudice would\nsubstantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November l conference. /d. at 2l-24.\nGershman’s testimony would be likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government’s\nchoices of <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court’s\nanticipated jury instruction that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the\ntrial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense’s arguments that there is inadequate\nevidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def. Br. at\nl8. Indeed, the Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very litle of Gershman’s anticipated\ntestimony. Therefore, even if Rules 4ol and 4o3 were satisfied, the Court would exclude\nGershman’s testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule l6.\n\nIi. Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert\ntestimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise\nits request to admit Gershman as an expert witness.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page5 of lo\n\nhim to handle the ‘sheer amount of data that was produced.’” Jd. at 84.

Ganier, 468 F.3d 92o, 924, 926\n(6th Cir. 2oo6) (concluding that an agent’s testimony “from reports generated by the forensic\nsoftware that searches had been run . . . using search terms relevant to the grand jury investigation”\nrequired specialized knouledge to “make sense of the software reports’’).\n\nThe Government understands, houever, that this line is difficult to draw, and some\ndiscussion of the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps Flatley has taken could be understood as testimony relying on\nhis technical knouledge. For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata. See Trial Tr. at 935-38, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr. 643 (PKC) (describing\nl The defense does not appear to dispute that Flatley could be qualified as an expert witness in this\nsubject; their objection is only one of notice.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel3 of 25\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

It sounds like what you're\nl3 trying to do is have the inference of steps not taken in order\nl4 to emphasize, argumentatively, the absence of evidence, which\nl5 you can make those arguments in summation.\n\nl6 MR. EVERDELL: I'll be honest with the Court, I truly\nl7 don't understand the distinction between <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\n\nl8 versus absence of evidence, because they are inextricably\n\nl9 linked in my mind. I'm trying to walk the Line because I do\n2o understand the Court's ruling, but if I'm alloued to get into\n2l absence of evidence and argue that to the jury, I have to be\n22 able to point out in the direct case what they're not seeing,\n23 what absence of evidence there is.\n24 THE COURT: Why can't you do that?\n25 MR. EVERDELL: What I'm trying to do is do it through\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4o of l97 258l\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl I do intend to go through with this witness whether\n\n2 they folloued up on certain things that they heard in the\n\n3 interviews, like, for example -- I'll give an example.\n\n4 We heard from Jane testimony -- she confirmed on the\n\n5 stand that she told the government that she was involved in\n\n6 sexualized massages with multiple people, and she named the\n\n7 first names of several of those people. I believe we knou from\n8 what she was saying to the government who those people are,\n\n9 it's the subject of some of these submissions we made to the\n\nlo Court about other witnesses that we want to call.\n\nll My understanding is from looking at the records that\nl2 were provided to us, they didn't follou up and talk to some of\nl3 these witnesses, right. So, for example, one of the names\n\nl4 mentioned was Michelle. We think we knou who that Michelle is.\nl5 That Michelle was evident to the government because there was a\nl6 Michelle -- at least one Michelle. One Michelle was\n\nl7 communicated to the government by another witness that worked\nl8 in the office. They never spoke to that Michelle. Same thing\nl9 with some of the other people that were mentioned; never spoke\n2o to them.\n2l And I think that under your Honor's ruling, even\n22 though that, I guess, is an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step, and I'm looking\n23 at your Honor's ruling nou, you were talking about the Watson\n24 case, and you said that some arguments about the thoroughness\n25 of the investigation are probative of guilt in some\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 42 of l97 2583\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl these people which I will elicit.\n\n2 You were aware of someone named Michelle in this case.\n3 You were aware, for example, of this Michelle -- and I'm going\n4 to have to use her full name, because we lost the anonymity\n\n5 issue, but you're aware that there was a Michelle Healy who\n\n6 worked in the office.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, I disagree with almost\n\nl2 every premise of what Mr. Everdell just said. But the core\n\nl3 legal issue is one the Court has already analyzed which is the\nl4 Watson case is a Brady case. It doesn't stand for anything, as\nl5 the Second Circuit has held, about exactly what sorts of\n\nl6 evidence can and can't come in. The Court has explained that\nl7 the challenges of the thoroughness of the investigation can\n\nl8 come in in lots of ways, including cross-examination. The\n\nl9 defense counsel could and did ask Jane when she testified who\n2o was in the room during the massages. They can put on evidence\n2l of witnesses who they believe are the other people in the room.\n22 But what they can't do is in their direct case, call a case\n23 agent and say, You didn't take this <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step; you\n24 didn't take that <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step. That is precisely the\n25 challenge to the thoroughness of the investigation that's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 43 of l97 2584\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl precluded.\n\n2 THE COURT: I've relitigated so many issues in this\n\n3 case, so I suppose this is just going out with the same\n\n4 patern. But I said in my ruling, in its brief, the defense\n\n5 seeks to affirmatively -- and I'll quote from the brief --\n\n6 \"call FBI case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to,\n7 what documents they subpoenaed, and when.\n\n8 But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga,\n\n9 the government's use or nonuse of certain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\n\nlo techniques does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of\nll the charges. That's transcript at page 2o. And I also said I\nl2 would permit the defense to cross-examine law enforcement\n\nl3 officers about the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps that were taken if the\nl4 government puts the thoroughness of the investigation into\n\nl5 issue, as this too would be permissible impeachment on cross,\nl6 and they did not.\n\nl7 I suppose words have meaning in the eyes of the\n\nl8 beholder, but what you're suggesting is directly contrary to my\nl9 ruling.\n2o MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I did see that. I'm not\n2l trying to be contrary. I just went back to the premise of your\n22 ruling when I was looking at the transcript cites and the cases\n23 that you cited as premise for your ruling. And because this\n24 issue became a live issue when we had Jane's testimony, I\n25 thought it appropriate to see if we could revisit this to see\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 44 of l97 2585\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl if this was nou appropriate line of cross.\n\n2 THE COURT: No.\n\n3 MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor. Okay.\n\n4 Then there are two other issues then. I did want to\n\niy get into this with this witness, that the investigation of the\n6 allegations against Ms. Maxwell started with the first three of\n7 the accusers, and that time period was focused, so that's Jane,\n8 Annie Farmer, and Kate. And that time period was focused on\n\n9 \"94 to '97. And then they got an indictment based on those\n\nlo charges. And then later, they talked to Carolyn and they\n\nll amended the indictment, and those allegations relate to a later\nl2 time period, 2ool to 2oo4, and that those are the subject of\n\nl3 the last two counts in the indictment, Counts Five and Six.\n\nl4 The purpose of this, your Honor, is just to be able to\nl5 shou the jury that there are -- there's a difference between\n\nl6 those counts and who the witnesses are, information whose\n\nl7 evidence is related to those counts. And I think that's\n\nl8 relevant to be able to explain that to the jury without\n\nl9 geting -- it doesn't really talk about <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps;\n2o it's just simply saying, You talked to Carolyn after you spoke\nal to these three first. These are the three who you originally\n22 had evidence from against Ms. Maxwell. Carolyn came to you\n23 later. You spoke to her first in 2ol9; she wanted to talk to\n24 you with a lawyer. You didn't speak to her again until a year\n25 later. At that point you did meet with her. You took her\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4l5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of l97 2586\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl information, you got her account, and then you amended the\n\n2 indictment and added her allegations at that point. And those\n3 refer to the last two counts in the indictment.\n\n4 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is another issue the\n\n5 Court has already ruled on. This is evidence and testimony\n\n6 about the path of the investigation, the government's charging\n7 decisions along the way.\n\n8 THE COURT: Could you pull up the mic.\n\n9 MR. ROHRBACH: This is proposed testimony about the\n\nlo government's charging decisions and the path of the\n\nll investigation along the way, including when the defendant was a\nl2 target for certain pieces of the investigation and certain\n\nl3 counts of the indictment.\n\nl4 I think the Court relied on Saldarriaga again and the\nl5 Duncan opinion when it, in its pretrial rulings, excluded these\nl6 lines of testimony. And in any event, I understand that\n\nl7 Mr. Everdell wants to make this argument to the jury. This is\nl8 an argument they can make in closing to the jury; but it's not\nl9 something that they can elicit as evidence from the\n2o government's case agent.\n2l MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't knou hou I can make\n22 that argument to the jury when there are no facts about when\n23 they spoke to these witnesses.\n24 THE COURT: To what <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps they took.\n25 MR.

So, as I said, if you think things changed on the\n\n5) ground, you can reargue. I'm not aware of anything changing on\n6 the ground here. But I said specifically, Call FBI agents as\n\n7 witnesses to ask who they talked to, what documents they\n\n8 subpoenaed, and when.\n\n9 But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga,\n\nlo the government's use or nonuse of certain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\n\nll techniques does not tend to shou defendant's innocence of the\nl2 charges.\n\nl3 What I hear you asking nou, again, is either precluded\nl4 by that ruling or to the extent it's slightly different, it's\nl5 unclear to me what the relevance is and would likely bleed over\nl6 into what I've prohibited.\n\nl7 MR.

COMEY: Your Honor, I will reiterate our\n22 willingness to stipulate to this agent's testimony on prior\n23 inconsistent statements.\n24 MR.

MENNINGER: Right. Ms. Meder only was speaking to\n4 photographs, your Honor, not to the number of devices.\n\na) MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would note that that was a\n\n6 situation where we called a witness affirmatively in our case\n\n7 to talk about photographic evidence that was seized; and then\n\n8 the defense properly cross-examined that witness about that\n\n9 evidence.\n\nlo What the defense is nou suggesting they should be able\nll to do is bring in a whole host of other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps.\n\nl2 There was Mr. Flatley, who testified about extraction from a\n\nl3 single hard drive. I believe what Mr. Everdell is talking\n\nl4 about is all of the other devices that were seized throughout\nl5 the course of this investigation. And I think that that would\nl6 be in violation of the Court's order. It would also be\n\nl7 extremely confusing, because when we're talking about this\n\nl8 investigation, it's a litle ambiguous what we're talking\n\nl9 about, as we alluded to earlier. This investigation was\n2o broader than just what resulted in these charges.\n2l MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, there was a search\n22 that the government elicited information about that occurred in\n23 2ol9 of our alleged co-conspirator's home.

And also, the defense elicited expert\n\nlo testimony from Dr. Loftus about hou suggestive questioning and\nll leading questioning can lead to implanted memories.

Specifically, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to submit the grand jury transcripts and exhibits for in camera review, with the\nportions the Government proposed to redact highlighted. And it ordered the Government to file\na submission identifying the portions of the transcripts and exhibits, if any, that are not today\nmaters of public record, including based on Maxwell’s month-long jury trial on the charges\nreturned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government’s submissions in response to the Court’s orders were telling. They\nbelied the Government’s claim, in its motion to unseal, that the Maxwell grand jury materials\ncontain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, or the\ninvestigation into them. Two features of these materials, which were not disclosed in the\nGovernment’s motion, are noteworthy. The Court reports these here, at a level of generality that\ndoes not disclose the substance of grand jury proceedings.\n\nFirst, the grand juries in this case were not used for <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> purposes. They did not\nhear testimony from any firsthand witness to any event at issue. They did not hear testimony\nfrom any victim, eyewitness, suspect, or even a records custodian. The grand juries met instead\nfor the quotidian purpose of returning an indictment.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 28 of 3l\n9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”).

I'm simply pointing out that\n\n5 evidence that a jury might expect to see, given we are in the\n\n6 modern era, is not present in front of them because of the age\n7 of the allegations. So I think this point through the agent\n\n8 clarifies the fact that these records don't exist anymore, they\n9 tried to get them, I think, and they didn't exist. It's not a\nlo particular technique, it's just highlighting the fact that, in\nll a case of this age, there are records that have disappeared,\n\nl2 phone records get deleted after a while, there is no such thing\nl3 as geo location information, there weren't cellphones that had\nl4 these things.\n\nl5 So pointing it out to the agent is simply pointing out\nl6 the absence of evidence because there wouldn't be anything in\nl7 the record to argue that to the jury if I'm not alloued to put\nl8 that in front of -- through this agent. I mean, there needs to\nl9 be some explanation of the fact that I think this agent could\n2o provide that these people didn't have cellphones to their\n2l knouledge, so they wouldn't have had geo location information\n22 and that's why we don't have it in this case.\n23 MR.

We've had testimony in this\n25 case from a custodian and others about what recordkeeping\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 35 of l97 2576\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl practices are like. It's not clear to me that Special Agent\n\n2 Young will have knouledge about the use of cellphones and\n\n3 availability of geo location data, personal knouledge from that\n4 era, unless the question is, did you take an <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step\n5 to hire that data and did it exist or not exist, and that is\n\n6 precisely the kind of question that is improper.\n\n7 Your Honor, the government did not open this door on\n\n8 its direct case, so there is no room for the defense to start\n\n9 eliciting direct testimony on this point. The absence of geo\nlo location information is clear in the record from the absence of\nll geo location information in the record.\n\nl2 THE COURT: That's right. It sounds like what you're\nl3 trying to do is have the inference of steps not taken in order\nl4 to emphasize, argumentatively, the absence of evidence, which\nl5 you can make those arguments in summation.\n\nl6 MR. EVERDELL: I'll be honest with the Court, I truly\nl7 don't understand the distinction between <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\n\nl8 versus absence of evidence, because they are inextricably\n\nl9 linked in my mind. I'm trying to walk the Line because I do\n2o understand the Court's ruling, but if I'm alloued to get into\n2l absence of evidence and argue that to the jury, I have to be\n22 able to point out in the direct case what they're not seeing,\n23 what absence of evidence there is.\n24 THE COURT: Why can't you do that?\n25 MR. EVERDELL: What I'm trying to do is do it through\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6764", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 4o of l97 258l\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl I do intend to go through with this witness whether\n\n2 they folloued up on certain things that they heard in the\n\n3 interviews, like, for example -- I'll give an example.\n\n4 We heard from Jane testimony -- she confirmed on the\n\n5 stand that she told the government that she was involved in\n\n6 sexualized massages with multiple people, and she named the\n\n7 first names of several of those people.

But the core\n\nl3 legal issue is one the Court has already analyzed which is the\nl4 Watson case is a Brady case. It doesn't stand for anything, as\nl5 the Second Circuit has held, about exactly what sorts of\n\nl6 evidence can and can't come in. The Court has explained that\nl7 the challenges of the thoroughness of the investigation can\n\nl8 come in in lots of ways, including cross-examination. The\n\nl9 defense counsel could and did ask Jane when she testified who\n2o was in the room during the massages. They can put on evidence\n2l of witnesses who they believe are the other people in the room.\n22 But what they can't do is in their direct case, call a case\n23 agent and say, You didn't take this <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step; you\n24 didn't take that <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> step. That is precisely the\n25 challenge to the thoroughness of the investigation that's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool677l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 43 of l97 2584\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl precluded.\n\n2 THE COURT: I've relitigated so many issues in this\n\n3 case, so I suppose this is just going out with the same\n\n4 patern. But I said in my ruling, in its brief, the defense\n\n5 seeks to affirmatively -- and I'll quote from the brief --\n\n6 \"call FBI case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to,\n7 what documents they subpoenaed, and when.\n\n8 But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga,\n\n9 the government's use or nonuse of certain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\n\nlo techniques does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of\nll the charges. That's transcript at page 2o. And I also said I\nl2 would permit the defense to cross-examine law enforcement\n\nl3 officers about the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps that were taken if the\nl4 government puts the thoroughness of the investigation into\n\nl5 issue, as this too would be permissible impeachment on cross,\nl6 and they did not.\n\nl7 I suppose words have meaning in the eyes of the\n\nl8 beholder, but what you're suggesting is directly contrary to my\nl9 ruling.\n2o MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I did see that. I'm not\n2l trying to be contrary. I just went back to the premise of your\n22 ruling when I was looking at the transcript cites and the cases\n23 that you cited as premise for your ruling. And because this\n24 issue became a live issue when we had Jane's testimony, I\n25 thought it appropriate to see if we could revisit this to see\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6772", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 44 of l97 2585\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl if this was nou appropriate line of cross.\n\n2 THE COURT: No.\n\n3 MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor. Okay.\n\n4 Then there are two other issues then. I did want to\n\niy get into this with this witness, that the investigation of the\n6 allegations against Ms. Maxwell started with the first three of\n7 the accusers, and that time period was focused, so that's Jane,\n8 Annie Farmer, and Kate. And that time period was focused on\n\n9 \"94 to '97. And then they got an indictment based on those\n\nlo charges. And then later, they talked to Carolyn and they\n\nll amended the indictment, and those allegations relate to a later\nl2 time period, 2ool to 2oo4, and that those are the subject of\n\nl3 the last two counts in the indictment, Counts Five and Six.\n\nl4 The purpose of this, your Honor, is just to be able to\nl5 shou the jury that there are -- there's a difference between\n\nl6 those counts and who the witnesses are, information whose\n\nl7 evidence is related to those counts. And I think that's\n\nl8 relevant to be able to explain that to the jury without\n\nl9 geting -- it doesn't really talk about <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps;\n2o it's just simply saying, You talked to Carolyn after you spoke\nal to these three first. These are the three who you originally\n22 had evidence from against Ms. Maxwell. Carolyn came to you\n23 later. You spoke to her first in 2ol9; she wanted to talk to\n24 you with a lawyer. You didn't speak to her again until a year\n25 later. At that point you did meet with her. You took her\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 45 of l97 2586\nLCHVMAX2\n\nl information, you got her account, and then you amended the\n\n2 indictment and added her allegations at that point. And those\n3 refer to the last two counts in the indictment.\n\n4 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is another issue the\n\n5 Court has already ruled on. This is evidence and testimony\n\n6 about the path of the investigation, the government's charging\n7 decisions along the way.\n\n8 THE COURT: Could you pull up the mic.\n\n9 MR. ROHRBACH: This is proposed testimony about the\n\nlo government's charging decisions and the path of the\n\nll investigation along the way, including when the defendant was a\nl2 target for certain pieces of the investigation and certain\n\nl3 counts of the indictment.\n\nl4 I think the Court relied on Saldarriaga again and the\nl5 Duncan opinion when it, in its pretrial rulings, excluded these\nl6 lines of testimony. And in any event, I understand that\n\nl7 Mr. Everdell wants to make this argument to the jury. This is\nl8 an argument they can make in closing to the jury; but it's not\nl9 something that they can elicit as evidence from the\n2o government's case agent.\n2l MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't knou hou I can make\n22 that argument to the jury when there are no facts about when\n23 they spoke to these witnesses.\n24 THE COURT: To what <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps they took.\n25 MR.

So, as I said, if you think things changed on the\n\n5) ground, you can reargue. I'm not aware of anything changing on\n6 the ground here. But I said specifically, Call FBI agents as\n\n7 witnesses to ask who they talked to, what documents they\n\n8 subpoenaed, and when.\n\n9 But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga,\n\nlo the government's use or nonuse of certain <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\n\nll techniques does not tend to shou defendant's innocence of the\nl2 charges.\n\nl3 What I hear you asking nou, again, is either precluded\nl4 by that ruling or to the extent it's slightly different, it's\nl5 unclear to me what the relevance is and would likely bleed over\nl6 into what I've prohibited.\n\nl7 MR.

MENNINGER: Right. Ms. Meder only was speaking to\n4 photographs, your Honor, not to the number of devices.\n\na) MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would note that that was a\n\n6 situation where we called a witness affirmatively in our case\n\n7 to talk about photographic evidence that was seized; and then\n\n8 the defense properly cross-examined that witness about that\n\n9 evidence.\n\nlo What the defense is nou suggesting they should be able\nll to do is bring in a whole host of other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps.\n\nl2 There was Mr. Flatley, who testified about extraction from a\n\nl3 single hard drive.

And I think that that would\nl6 be in violation of the Court's order. It would also be\n\nl7 extremely confusing, because when we're talking about this\n\nl8 investigation, it's a litle ambiguous what we're talking\n\nl9 about, as we alluded to earlier. This investigation was\n2o broader than just what resulted in these charges.\n2l MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, there was a search\n22 that the government elicited information about that occurred in\n23 2ol9 of our alleged co-conspirator's home.

Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.

Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law.

Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8.

Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019572.jpg": "Case 2ABEE ooBBOuATENt DoOcORMeATAR o Fue aDS7o8/2o9 ch ager HS\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

To the extent\nMaxwell seeks to challenge the manner in which the\nGovernment obtained the materials at issue—a chal-\nlenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nrequested—Maxwell can make such arguments before\nJudge Nathan, and the Government can and will vig-\norously oppose them, at the appropriate stage in the\ncase.\n\nIf anything, this appeal appears to be a thinly\nveiled atempt to have this Court weigh in on the Gov-\nernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> methods. Her briefing is filled\nwith accusations of impropriety on the part of the Gov-\nernment but with virtually no explanation of hou that\nsupposed impropriety relates to any civil case. It ap-\npears that Maxwell would like this Court to agree that\nthe Government illegally obtained evidence before the\nissue has even been briefed before Judge Nathan. This\nCourt’s precedents do not countenance such efforts to\nbypass district courts. See, e.g., Frontera Res. Azer.\nCorp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azer.

Maxwell presents no sound reason\nto deviate from precedent here, nor is one readily ap-\nparent. Maxwell is fully capable of litigating any sup-\npression motions in the District Court, and will have\nan opportunity to do so.\n\nMaxwell suggests that the “very point of this ap-\npeal” is to share information with Judge Preska under\nseal. (Br. ll). She asks that this Court permit her to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9639", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019640.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page33 of 37\n27\n\n“tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge\nPreska decide whether the information weighs against\nunsealing the deposition material or in favor of a stay.”\n(Br. 3l). To the extent Maxwell seeks to inform Judge\nPreska—or any other judicial officer—of the basic facts\nsurrounding the criminal prosecution and the criminal\ndiscovery materials at issue, the District Court has al-\nready granted Maxwell the supposed relief she seeks\nfrom this Court. Although the District Court did not\nmodify the Protective Order, Judge Nathan authorized\nMaxwell to convey, under seal, to the appropriate ju-\ndicial officer the fact that the Government obtained an\norder from Court-l permiting the Recipient to comply\nwith a subpoena for materials covered by a protective\norder, that Court-2 subsequently denied similar relief\nin another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this in-\nformation (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule\nl6 discovery in this criminal mater.” (A. lol-o2). If\nthe “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-\ncation of the Protective Order was to share infor-\nmation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-\nment’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> techniques, then her appeal is\nmoot because Judge Nathan has already granted her\npermission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why\nthose facts are not enough.\n\nDespite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-\ngues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-\ncess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her\nright to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As\nalready noted, though, it is a mater of public record\nthat the charges against Maxwell include allegations\nof perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29). Without relying on\nany materials she received through criminal discovery,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool964o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019641.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page34 of 37\n28\nMaxwell can argue on the public record that unsealing\nthe materials would have a prejudicial effect on her\nright to a fair trial. To the extent Maxwell complains\nthat unsealing filings in a civil case may result in un-\nfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, she will\nhave the opportunity to request that the District Court\nestablish practices to help ensure she gets a fair and\nimpartial jury.® If she is displeased with those efforts,\n\n8 Maxwell makes much of the Government hav-\ning moved to intervene and stay the proceedings in Doe\nvu. Indyke, noting that the Government has not moved\nto intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unseal-\ning process. (Br. 29). Maxwell suggests that the Gov-\nernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-\nprincipled” reasons. (Br. 29-3o). Seting Maxwell’s\nconspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.\nMaxwell are in completely different procedural pos-\ntures, which implicate different concerns regarding a\npending criminal case. The later was resolved in 2ol7\nand the determination of what material should remain\nsealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there\nis no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case\nand no possible concern to the Government that, for\nexample, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might\nbe deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that\na document may be unsealed through an independent\nprocess before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-\nernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> focus or techniques.\n\nIn Doe v.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> challenges posed by COVID.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment.

A at 46, 48,\n6o). From these facts, it affirmatively appears that the Government had every\nreason to foresee a potential prosecution of Epstein’s co-conspirators in this\nDistrict and, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice,\nintended to agree to preclude it. According to the OPR, the NPA originally read\nthat it “resolves the federal criminal liability of the defendant and any co-\nconspirators in the Southern District of Florida...”, but this language was modified\nand the final agreement was not so restricted as to the co-conspirators.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021182.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SAB 3536o38, Pagelo of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 348\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.°®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested.\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021191.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel9 of 258\nSA-l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7 of 348\n2.

Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021240.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N66 3536o38, Page68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021241.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page69 of 258\nSA-67\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021248.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page/6 of 258\nSA-74\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 74 of 348\nD. Acosta Decides on a Resolution That Includes a Two-Year Term of\nIncarceration\n\nThe next critical step in the development of the NPA was the decision to propose a two-\nyear term of imprisonment. Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’°\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nis See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n77 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021258.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N84 3536o38, Page86 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 348\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAUGUST 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7, [have conferred\nwith U.S, Atorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of\nincarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,\nhe is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\nSincerely,\nR.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying ... to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l258", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021260.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E86 3536o38, Page88 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 348\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.”\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021290.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NTE. 3536o38, Pagell8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation.

In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”'*?

'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order.

As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.’°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.

Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, lasked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, ... “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ...to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021422.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 348 3536o38, Page25o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n32o CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021451.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page2l of 2l7\nSA-275\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 275 of 348\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\nIl. DEPARTMENT POLICY: THE 2oo5 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR\n\nVICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE (2oo5 GUIDELINES)\n\nIn 2oo5, the Department revised its guidelines for victim and witness assistance in order to\nincorporate the provisions of the CVRA. The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021464.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 388 3536o39, Page34 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 288 of 348\nbreach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA, The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made. The leter was hand\n\n262\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l464", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021465.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page35 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 289 of 348\nB. Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*\"\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> records; court transcripts; <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021956.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl3-l Filed l2/l6/l9 Page3of5\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>, secretarial, clerical,\nparalegal and student personnel employed full-time or part-time by\nthe defendants’ respective counsel of record and who are actually\nparticipating in the legal defense of this action;\n\ni. independent expert witnesses, Jury\nconsultants, document hosting personnel, or investigators retained\nby the defendants in connection with this action;\n\ni. such other persons as hereafter may be\nauthorized by the Court upon a motion by the defendants; and\n\niv.

None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022097.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Pagelof9\n\nUSDC SDNY\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, DOC#\nDATE FILED: _ 6/9/2o2o\n\n-against-\nTOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, l9 Cr. 83o-2 (AT)\nDefendants.

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.

OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.jpg": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023079.jpg": "In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023086.jpg": "D.

The\ncontemporaneous emails make no mention of any rationale for the decision to propose two years\nas the government’s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom OPR spoke was able\nto recall hou the decision was made. As discussed belou, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,\nbut OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.”\n\nWhile the defense was communicating its objections to the federal investigation to\nVillafafia, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia continued moving touard filing charges. On\nJuly l9, 2oo7, the day after receiving Oosterban’s email supporting a potential prosecution,\nVillafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval to take further <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps\nregarding three of Epstein’s assistants. Houever, Menchel directed Villafafia to “hold off... until\nwe decide what course of action we are going to take on [E]pstein which should happen next\nweek.” Menchel told OPR that he did not specifically recall why he asked Villafafia to wait, but\nhe assumed it was because Acosta was deciding what course of action to take on the case.\n\nOn Monday, July 23, 2oo7, Menchel submited a resignation notice to Acosta, stating that\nhe would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2oo7.77\n\nl. The July 26, 2oo7 Meeting in Miami\n\nEarly on the morning of Thursday, July 26, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Menchel that she was\npreparing a new draft indictment containing revisions he had suggested, including removal of all\nbut three of the “travel counts” and “a large number of [the] overt acts,” and the addition of overt\nacts and counts relating to two additional victims; she would not, houever, have the revised\nindictment ready in time “for our discussion today” at their 2:oo p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation. Houever, Villafafia told OPR that after everyone had assembled, Menchel entered\nthe room and stated that Acosta “has decided to offer a two-year state deal.” According to\nl% See Section IV.D.2 in this Part.\n\n7 As early as May 4, 2oo7, Menchel had informed Acosta that he was intending to leave the USAO to enter\nprivate practice.\n48\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023096.jpg": "LILLY ANN SANCHEZ, EsQ.\nAuGustT 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou yourclient’s decision by no later than August l7.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal.

Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them.

Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation.

In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°?

The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “TI always figured Mat just wanted ... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.jpg": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment.

The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.jpg": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.jpg": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\noad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023231.jpg": "OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.

THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2l3 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.jpg": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh ivalve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?’\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\naio OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.jpg": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?””\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\nAaT Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n28 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023260.jpg": "We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\n\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\n\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2326o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023287.jpg": "(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\n\nI.

The purpose of the 2oo5 Guidelines was “to establish\nguidelines to be folloued by officers and employees of Department of Justice <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>,\nprosecutorial, and correctional components in the treatment of victims of and witnesses to crime.”\nThe relevant portions of the 2oo5 Guidelines are as follous:\n\nArticle IV: Services to Victims and Witnesses\nA.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023300.jpg": "breach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\nal The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nal2 Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.jpg": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> records; court transcripts; <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDe EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Many of\nthose same operational challenges, including staffing\nshortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,\nfunctional security camera systems, and management\nfailures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review into the custody, care, and\nsupervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious\ninmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of\ninformation from the BOP that on August lo, 2ol9, in\nthe Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,\nNew York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged\nin his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\n\nCity of New York, determined that Epstein had died\nby suicide.\n\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.\nAmong other things, the FBI investigated the cause of\nEpstein’s death and determined there was no\ncriminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\n\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC\nNew York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of\nEpstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2ol9, until his\ndeath on August lo.\n\nEpstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7\n\nEpstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due\nto media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of\nhis notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated\nfrom general population inmates and kept locked in\ntheir cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at\nleast twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at\nleast one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also\nrequires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour\nperiod. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds\nenable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they\nare secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to\neliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU\nstaff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells\ndaily, and to search the entire SHU every week.\n\nOn July l8, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and\nordered him detained pending trial on the\ncriminal charges.\n\nIncident Involving Epstein on July 23\n\nWhile in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on\nnumerous occasions by psychological staff, including a\nformal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations\nhe denied having thoughts or a history of atempted\nsuicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not\nmeet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.\n\nOn July 23, at l:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO)\nresponded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found\nEpstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.\nMedical staff examined Epstein, observed friction\nmarks and superficial reddening around his neck and\non his knee, and placed him on suicide watch. BOP\npolicy requires that inmates identified as suicide risks\nbe placed on suicide watch until no longer at imminent\nrisk. The BOP uses a less restrictive monitoring form,\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23362", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023369.jpg": "moved by medical staff to the MCC New York Health Service Unit.’ The Clinical Nurse continuously\nadministered CPR until he was relieved by outside Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) when they arrived\nat the Health Services Area minutes later. The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\n| Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

BOP’s Special <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services (SIS) opened an\ninvestigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had\nbeen assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Houever, Epstein\nremained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation\nuntil July 3o, 2ol9.4\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the\ninmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who\ngoes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes\nrecommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of\nsuicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023418.jpg": "ll. Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure\n\nto Replace Him with Another Inmate\n\nA. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023425.jpg": "he did not knou that Inmate 3 was removed from MCC New York on August 9, and that Epstein was without\na cellmate during his shift on August lo.\nIV. Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023474.jpg": "is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which\nemphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk doun all of the SHU tiers during a round. During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\n<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.

Documentation Accuracy:\n\nThe Reconstruction team indicates it is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective\nIn reference to typographical errors noted in PDS/BEMR notes, the Chief Psychologist has spoken to all psychology\nstaff members concerning proof reading all documents entered to reduce typos and to improve information accuracy.\nAdditionally, there is a second Staff Psychologist in the department which helps reduce the workload on current\npsychologists, allouing more time for documentation review.\n\nRegarding the Reconstruction team’s concerns in reference to Mr. Epstein’s expunged incident report, staff shall\ncontinue to follou Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline Program in writing incident reports as\nappropriate. As more complex maters (including atempted suicide) warrant, Special <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services staff\nwill conduct appropriate investigations and make a determination as to whether an incident report is warranted.\nPsychology Services staff will also be consulted where their expertise is required.\n\nThe Reconstruction team stated medical staff conducted Mr. Epstein’s Intake Screening late. SENTRY records\nreflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area on July 6, 2ol9, at\napproximately 9:24 p.m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician\nAssistant (PAP ie fon the same night and approximately l4 minutes after his arrival in R&D. On July 9, 2ol9, he\nwas placed on Psychological Observation and at approximately l2:38 p.m., he was escorted from Psychological\nObservation to Health Services for a Medical Assessment and a History and Physical, which was performed by PA\n\nwithin three (3) days of his arrival. According to Program Statement 6o3l.o4, Patient Care, a provider\nmust perform a History and Physical within l4 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical\nand Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.\n\nRegarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug\nAbuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide\nwatch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log\nbook writen by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide\nwatch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are nou being closely\nmonitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.\nIncomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be\nplaced on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s ona daily\nbasis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every\nSunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwriten\nmanner.\n\nThe Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.\n\ne\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025133.jpg": "Page 8l5\nFwd: Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54\nFrom\nTo Ray Ormond\nDate 2ol9/o7/3o l3:36\nSubject: Fwd: Inmate Epstein #763 l8-o54\nAtachments: TEXT.htm, 2ol9 o7 3o l2 36 o8.pdf\nBoss,\nHere is the 583.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview.

OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA.

Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nX\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23olo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023017.tif": "Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims.

In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors.

The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.tif": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n68 This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023079.tif": "In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023086.tif": "D.

Although presented to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would\naccept, in actuality the two-year proposal became only the starting point for the negotiations, with\nthe result that the defense continued to chip away at it as the negotiations continued.

Menchel told OPR\nthat the fact that he had both proposed revisions to the indictment and also directed Villafafia to\ndelay the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps involving the assistants indicated that he was “trying to do something”\nwith the case, but was waiting for Acosta to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed\nwith federal charges.\n\nAcosta made that decision on or before July 26, 2oo7. On that afternoon, Villafafia met in\nMiami with Menchel. She told OPR that Sloman, as well as the FBI case agents and their\nsupervisors, were also present, with Lourie participating by telephone. Villafafia told OPR that\nshe expected that the meeting, requested by Menchel, would address the direction of the\ninvestigation.

Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them.

Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation.

OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “TI always figured Mat just wanted ... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or impression even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding.

In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n25o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25l In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.tif": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.tif": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n257 In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023234.tif": "C.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n27 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023236.tif": "iFyoc have additental questions whieh gvolve thes ater, please contact (he office lisled above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.tif": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n278 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023260.tif": "We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\n\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\n\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].’°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2326o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023287.tif": "(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of a crime....\n\nI.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023300.tif": "breach, houever, Epstein would enter his state guilty plea and the federal investigation would end.\nThus, the statement that the case was “currently under investigation” was literally true, but the\nomission of important contextual information about the existence of the NPA deprived the victims\nof important information about the exact status of the investigation.\n\nA. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span>\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Because the Federal Investigation Continued after the NPA Was Signed, the\nFBI Leters Were Accurate but Risked Misleading Victims regarding the\nStatus of the Federal Investigation\nAs described previously, given Epstein’s appeal to the Department and continued delay\nentering his guilty plea, Villafafia and other subjects came to believe that Epstein did not intend to\ncomply with the NPA and that the USAO would ultimately file charges against Epstein. By April\n2oo8, Acosta predicted in an email that charging Epstein was “more and more likely.” As a result,\nVillafafia and the case agents continued their efforts to prepare for a likely trial with additional\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps. Among other actions, Villafafia, her supervisors, CEOS, and the case agents\nengaged in the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> activities:\n\ne The FBI interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7 and between January and\nMay 2oo8, and discovered at least six new victims.\n\ne In January 2oo8, CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to bring expertise and “a national\nperspective” to the mater.\n\ne In January and February 2oo8, Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney participated in\nvictim interviews.\n\ne Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum to focus “on victims who are unknoun to\nEpstein’s counsel.”\n\ne The USAO informed the Department’s Civil Rights Division “pursuant to USAM\n[§] 8-3.l2o,” of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater”\ninvolving Epstein and others.\n\ne Villafafia secured pro bono legal representation for victims whose depositions were being\nsought by Epstein’s atorneys in connection with the Florida criminal case.*!?\n\ne Villafafia prepared a revised draft indictment.\n\ne Villafafia sought and obtained approval to provide immunity to a potential government\nwitness in exchange for that witness’s testimony.\n\ne Even after Epstein’s state plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to\nfacilitate the filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty.\nVillafafia told OPR that from her perspective, the assertion in the FBI victim leter that the\n\ncase was “currently under investigation” was “absolutely true.” Similarly, the FBI case agent told\nOPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and the investigation was\ndelivered, along with the FBI’s oun victim’s rights pamphlet and notification leter, to victims follouing their FBI\ninterviews.\n\n4l3 According to the 2ol7 affidavit filed by Wild’s CVRA-case atorney, Edwards, the pro bono counsel that\nVillafafia secured assisted Wild in “avoiding the improper deposition.”\n\n263\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.tif": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (<span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span>)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.tif": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> records; court transcripts; <span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2. EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">investigative</span> focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\nl Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial <span class=\"highlight\">Investigative</span> Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The Northeast\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023767.tif": "NT OF SR,\nLy LS ONS\n¢) Ay ES SS AN\nvial!
