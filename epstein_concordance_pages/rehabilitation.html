That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span> are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 Amendment then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span>. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span> remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5488", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 69\nmotive to fabricate arose immediately after the supposed child-abuse, and thus statements made\nto others, months or years later, were inadmissible under nou-Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(). The same is\ntrue here. The improper influence and motive to fabricate occurred, in several instances, many\nyears ago, shortly after the purported abuse occurred, and before the recently-disclosed\n\"consistent\" statements. Wright & Miller, 3oB Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6753 Consistent\nPremotive Statements (2o2l ed.) (\"As in Tome, prior consistent statements will frequently be\ntainted by the same alleged motive to lie that is claimed to impugn the witness' trial testimony. If\nso, Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i) does not permit their introduction. This result has favorable policy\nimplications. As Tome stresses, the general exclusion of prior consistent statements ensures that\n‘the whole emphasis of the trial’ does not “shift to the out-of-court statements” as opposed to 'the\nin-court ones.\"\").\n\nIf the government instead offers prior consistent statements to rehabilitate their accusers\nor explain their faulty memory under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), the \"offered prior consistent\nstatement must serve to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility on the same ground upon which the\nwitness’s credibility was atacked.\" United States. v. Karl Roye, Crim. No. 3:l5-cr-29 (JBA),\n2ol6 WL 4l47l33 at *l (D. Conn. Aug. 4, 2ol6) (citing l McCormick On Evid. § 47 (7th ed.)\n(“The general test of admissibility is whether evidence of the witness’s ... consistent statements\nis logically relevant to explain the impeaching fact. The rehabilitating facts must meet the\nimpeachment with relative directness. The wall, atacked at one point, may not be fortified at\nanother, distinct point.”)). As was the case prior to the 2ol4 Amendments, \"a prior consistent\nstatement may only be used for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span> “when the statement has a probative force bearing\non credibility beyond merely shouing repetition.” United States v.

Oct. 2o, 2oo5) (‘Because the\ninformant’s statements are not hearsay, and because the government will not call the informant\nas a witness at trial, it follous that defendant may not impeach the credibility of the informant.”).\n\nIn this case, the Government is not planning to call Minor Victim-5 or Minor Victim-6.\nTo the extent other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities of Minor Victim-5 and\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span> are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)). The effect of the 2ol4 Amendment then, as\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6449", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 69\nthe Second Court explained, was to allou for such statements to be admited \"substantively as\nwell,\" rather than as non-substantive <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span>. See United States v. Flores, 945 F.3d 687,\n7o5-o6 (2d. Cir. 2ol9) (amendment \"extend/s] substantive effect to consistent statements that\nrebut other atacks on a witness — such as the charges of inconsistency or faulty memory\")\n(emphasis in original). Thus, consistent with Pierre and other pre-2ol4 cases, prior consistent\nstatements may be admissible to rehabilitate a witness or to explain a faulty memory, and any\nsuch evidence will nou be admited substantively, but the limits on those prior methods of\nadmiting prior consistent statements for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span> remain applicable post-2ol4.\n\nB. Substantial Limits Remain on Admissibility of Prior Consistent Statements\n\nThe question at trial will be which of the supposedly prior consistent statements are\nadmissible and for what purpose. On that question, the government is silent. See Mot. at l9\n(government \"intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims'\nprior consistent statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein\")\n(emphasis added). By not specifying in their Motion which statements they seek to introduce or\nthe specific purposes for which they will move for admission, the government has deprived the\ndefense of an opportunity to challenge the statements' admissibility or for the Court to rule on the\nadmissibility pre-trial. Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)'s amendment in 2ol4 did not alter the landscape so\nmuch that any atack on the accusers’ credibility will allou any prior consistent statement.\nImportant limits remain on the admissibility of prior consistent statements.\n\nIf the government moves to admit particular statements to rebut a charge of recent\nfabrication or improper motive under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), as the Motion suggests they will, the\nevidentiary hurdles established by Tome v. United States, 5l3 U.S. l5o, l56 (l995), still apply.\nIn particular, the government must shou proof that the motive for fabrication or improper\npurpose arose after the purported statement. In Zome, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo645o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 69\nmotive to fabricate arose immediately after the supposed child-abuse, and thus statements made\nto others, months or years later, were inadmissible under nou-Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(). The same is\ntrue here. The improper influence and motive to fabricate occurred, in several instances, many\nyears ago, shortly after the purported abuse occurred, and before the recently-disclosed\n\"consistent\" statements. Wright & Miller, 3oB Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6753 Consistent\nPremotive Statements (2o2l ed.) (\"As in Tome, prior consistent statements will frequently be\ntainted by the same alleged motive to lie that is claimed to impugn the witness' trial testimony. If\nso, Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i) does not permit their introduction. This result has favorable policy\nimplications. As Tome stresses, the general exclusion of prior consistent statements ensures that\n‘the whole emphasis of the trial’ does not “shift to the out-of-court statements” as opposed to 'the\nin-court ones.\"\").\n\nIf the government instead offers prior consistent statements to rehabilitate their accusers\nor explain their faulty memory under Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), the \"offered prior consistent\nstatement must serve to rehabilitate the witness’s credibility on the same ground upon which the\nwitness’s credibility was atacked.\" United States. v. Karl Roye, Crim. No. 3:l5-cr-29 (JBA),\n2ol6 WL 4l47l33 at *l (D. Conn. Aug. 4, 2ol6) (citing l McCormick On Evid. § 47 (7th ed.)\n(“The general test of admissibility is whether evidence of the witness’s ... consistent statements\nis logically relevant to explain the impeaching fact. The rehabilitating facts must meet the\nimpeachment with relative directness. The wall, atacked at one point, may not be fortified at\nanother, distinct point.”)). As was the case prior to the 2ol4 Amendments, \"a prior consistent\nstatement may only be used for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span> “when the statement has a probative force bearing\non credibility beyond merely shouing repetition.” United States v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d.\nCir. l986).\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo645l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 77\nwho have been found guilty of dissimilar conduct.”) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span>\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 37 of 77\nended. In fact, she has been involved in two commited, long-term, loving relationships with men\nwho had young children. She is not a danger to the community and there is no concern about\nrecidivism.\n\nIn imposing an appropriate sentence, we urge the Court to credit a number of factors:\n\n=» Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced for non-violent offenses which occurred\ndecades ago (l994 to 2oo4).\n\n= Ms. Maxwell is over 6o years old.\n\n=» Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community in any way.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell has no prior criminal history or prior bad acts.\n\n=» Ms. Maxwell has served the entirely of pre-sentence detention during the\nCOVID pandemic.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell served 22 months of pre-sentence detention under extraordinarily\nabnormal and restrictive conditions of solitary confinement as a non-violent\ndefendant who posed no danger to herself or others.\n\n=\" Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced solely for reasons of punishment.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell is not being sentenced for <span class=\"highlight\">rehabilitation</span>.\n\n= Ms. Maxwell poses no risk of recidivism.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell’s personal characteristics and history of lawful behavior pre- and\nand post-dating the offense conduct further distinguishes her situation and warrants sentencing\nconsideration.\n\nProbation recognizes that a dounward variance is warranted in this case. Houever,\nnoticeably absent from Probation’s justification is any mention of detention served during the\npandemic and under harsh conditions of solitary confinement.

Indeed, the Court was already under\nthe impression that the Defense intended to pursue this line of cross-examination after the\nDaubert hearing. Nov. lo Tr. at l57 (“[D]o you intend to impeach any witnesses based on\nsubstance abuse? .. .

Citing Sasso, the Second Circuit affirmed, explaining that through cross-\nexamination alone, “the jury was well aware of . . . [the witness’s] drug abuse and treatment\nhistory.” Jd. The Second Circuit has made such a distinction—permiting cross-examination on\ndrug use but excluding a formal diagnosis of| | several cases. E.g., DiPaolo, 8o4\nF.2d at 23o; Dobson v. Walker, l5o F. App’x 49, 52 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (explaining that cross-\nexamination about a witness’s drug use before witnessing a murder would be admissible, but the\ngeneral fact that the witness uses drugs is not). The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def. Br. at\nl3, held only that a defendant had the right to review a witness’s medical records and cross-\nexamine the witness about his drug use, Robinson, 583 F.3d at l27l-75.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 242 of 247 4ol\nLBUCmax7\n\nl Here defense counsel, in opening statements, suggested\n2 to the jury that a recent motive to fabricate in this case was\n3 civil litigation in a particular Jeffrey Epstein victim\n\n4 compensation fund.
