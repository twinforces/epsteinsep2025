Until about 2oo4, this patern of sexual abuse\ncontinued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in\nvarious locations in the United States.\n\nl. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nIn September 2oo7, follouing state and federal investigations\ninto allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered\ninto an NPA with USAO-SDEL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead\nguilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida\n' Unless otherwise noted, the follouing facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial\nand described in the light most favorable to the Government.

During the course of the NPA\nnegotiations, the co-conspirator immunity clause was\nsevered from Epstein’s immunity clause and moved\ngeographically to the end of the NPA after the 2255\nsection. This is significant because the 2255 sections\n“were not limited to any district.” The 2255 section\nand the co-conspirator clause were negotiated in\ntandem and the 2255 language was accepted in return\nfor the global immunity provided to the co-conspira-\ntors.

The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous\nto support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a\nwitness believe that their testimony is false. United\nStates v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a\ngeneral mater, “[a] jury is best equipped to determine\nthe meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific\nquestion.” Id. Courts have acknouledged a narrou\nexception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them\ncannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also United\nStates v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375. The existence of some arguable\nambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against\na witness who understood the question.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000140.jpg": "77a\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature.\nCourts typically evaluate whether a question was\nfundamentally ambiguous only after the development\nof a full factual record at trial. See, e.g., United States\nv. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The\nevidence at trial may shed further light on whether the\nquestions posed were objectively ambiguous in context\nor whether Maxwell subjectively understood them.\nIn any event, the Court has closely considered each of\nthe categories of questions that Maxwell argues are\nambiguous. None of the alleged ambiguities Maxwell\nidentifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the\ncharges. The context of the questions and answers, in\nconjunction with the Government’s evidence, could\nlead a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror to conclude that the statements\nwere perjurious. Truth and falsity are questions for the\njury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court\ndeclines to usurp the jury’s role on the limited pretrial\n\nrecord.\nB. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude that\n\nMaxwell’s statements were material\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should\nbe dismissed because none of the allegedly false\nstatements were material to the defamation action. In\na civil deposition, a statement is material if it has a\nnatural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful\nanswer might reasonably lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S.\n5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l,\n753-64 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing falsity, materiality is\nan element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be\n“decided by the jury, not the court.” Johnson v. United\nStates, 52o US. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most\nextraordinary circumstances justify departure from\nthis general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp.\nDOJ-OGR-oooool4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000141.jpg": "78a\n2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 US. at\n522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this\nnarrou exception. Maxwell contends that the questions\ndid not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\nallegations at the center of the civil case, but that is\nnot the legal standard. The Government may prevail if\nit proves that Maxwell’s answers could have led to\nthe discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9;\nKross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror\ncould conclude that truthful answers to the questions\nmay have permited the plaintiff to locate other\nvictims or witnesses who could have corroborated the\nplaintiff’s testimony. The factual disputes relating to\nmateriality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard\nagainst “invading the ‘inviolable function of the jury’\nin our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense\nraises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined\nwith a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot\nresolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United\nStates v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are\nlegally tenable and appropriately presented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried\nseparately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the\nCourt concludes that the interests of justice require\nsevering those counts and trying them separately.\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act\ncounts would require admiting evidence of other\nacts likely to be unduly prejudicial. It would also risk\n\nDOJ-OGR-Oooool4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000150.jpg": "87a\nagreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six\nweeks in advance of trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request\nfor a hearing to determine the admissibility of co-\nconspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements\nmay often be admited at trial on a conditional basis.\nIf the Court determines that the Government has not\nmet its burden to shou that the conditionally admited\nstatements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting in-\nstruction or, in extreme cases declare a mistrial.\nUnited States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir.\nl993). Although conditional admissions can pose a\nproblem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here be-\ncause the Government has commited to producing co-\nconspirator statements at least six weeks in advance\nof trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.\nMaxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the\nGovernment’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority\nto compel pretrial disclosure of the identity of\ngovernment witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528\nF.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975). In deciding whether to\norder accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts\nconsider whether a defendant has made a specific\nshouing that disclosure is “both material to the\npreparation of the defense and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in light of\nthe circumstances surrounding the case.” United\nStates v. Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l89-l4o (2d Cir. l99o)\n(cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the\nGovernment must produce a witness list reasonably in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000151.jpg": "88a\nadvance of trial. The nature of the allegations in\nthis case—decades-old allegations spanning multiple\nlocations—present considerable challenges for the\npreparation of the defense. Houever, the Government’s\nproposed disclosure schedule—which will afford Maxwell\nat least six weeks to investigate testifying witness\nstatements—allous Maxwell significantly more time\nto review disclosures than schedules adopted in most\ncases in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb,\nNo. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v.\nNachamie, 9l F.

Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early\ndisclosure of evidence the Government seeks to offer\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule\n4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a criminal case intends to\nuse “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a\ndefendant, the prosecutor must “provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nnotice of the general nature of any such evidence that\nthe prosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do\nso in writing before trial—or in any form during trial\nif the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial\nnotice.” The Government represents that it will notify\nthe defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least\n45 days in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any\n\nDOJ-OGR-Oooool5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000152.jpg": "89a\n\nmotions in limine to be considered at the final pretrial\nconference. The Government’s proposal will give\nMaxwell an opportunity to challenge admission of that\nevidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any\nissues that require resolution before trial. “This is all\nthat Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson,\nNo. l3-cr-378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.\nDec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, although additional time to\nenable briefing and resolution in advance of trial is\nstrongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel\npretrial disclosures does not preclude the parties from\nnegotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery\ntimeline that will account for Maxwell’s specific\nconcerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure\nwill redound to the benefit of all parties, counsel, and\nthe court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26,\nl32 (2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate a final, omnibus schedule to\npropose to the Court. The Court concludes that the\ndisclosure of all of the above materials approximately\nsix to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate\nand sufficient.\n\nGiven the complexities of the case and the addition\nof two counts via the S2 indictment, the Court\nencourages the parties to agree to approximately eight\nweeks.\n\nIX.

Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000282.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 9 of l6\nFinally, the government fails to consider the doctrine of pre-indictment delay, inasmuch\n\nas the statute of limitations does not fully define a defendant’s rights with respect to delays that\noccurred prior to the indictment. See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v.

Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000813.jpg": "Cas@’4Sol4-4648o-RMEDbeuMeRPsD | Pilee OV l82 graGerss dF 33 |\n(2) The defense bail package proposes excessive involvement of the Court in routine\naspects of Mr. Epstein’s proposed home confinement.

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001137.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedg@s 4l 2o45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001191.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo BB G+AN Nt DOEUMEr? lo8 2 Filed6RA23/2tgPageblGl5\n892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nassurances, not absolute guarantees.”). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)). The strength of the government’s case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001259.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd3souAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3i2e8/2agPidge& 66l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request. Ud. § ll).\nThe provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the\nperson whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship. To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l). By contrast, there are numerous examples\nof French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality follouing the\ncommission of an offense. (/d. 4 2l). Accordingly, Mr. Julie concludes: “[I]t cannot have been\nthe intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person\nwho has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.” (/d.\n\n4] 26).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive\nany and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms.\nMaxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the\n“<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail. While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool259", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001263.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€rOd33ouAUNt DibCutent l7o2 lFiRGSSe/Raghiages o6l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances, not absolute guarantees.\").

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001331.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel4 of 25\nwhile her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\nE.

Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr.

As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make.

The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84);\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “Tc]ircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83); and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool987", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4l of 45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page 6 of l5\n892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nassurances, not absolute guarantees.”). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that\nee\nPe (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states hat [a\na\n(emphasis added)).

Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.\nl996).\n\nWhile Duren did not define which community is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,\nit is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l3o Filed o2/ol/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited).

In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v.

Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).\n\nAs shoun above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is irrelevant to the conspiracy counts.\nThus, to the extent that the government intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such\nevidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed. R. Evid.\nAo4(b).\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2689", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 23\nimmediately disclose all potentially favorable evidence having a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> probability to\naffect the outcome of the proceedings.

Such evidence includes any\nand all evidence of a witness’ prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent\nstatements, and statements demonstrating a lack of knouledge or a denial of the facts of the\ncase or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct from which it\ncan be inferred the witness is untruthful.\n\nBut disclosure of Brady material is not the end of the line. Quite the contrary, it is a\nlaunching point for an investigation that may bear critical information. In order to mount an\neffective defense, Ms. Maxwell must receive this material in sufficient time to investigate\nand develop it for effective use before and during trial.

Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their\ndefense?\n\nId. at 88l.\n\nHere, the application of the Turkish factors favors early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses. The indictment does not allege crimes of violence, Ms. Maxwell has no\ncriminal history, and the government has conceded that she is not a danger to the community.\nThe age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed by a global pandemic makes\ninvestigation and preparation of this case complex and difficult.

For instance, Maxwell asserts that it\n“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from\nMs. Maxwell as part of civil discovery and disseminating that information to the public, as part of\nan ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def.

She has “offered no credible\nevidence to suggest that the Government tarried in bringing charges against [her] solely to gain\nsome prosecutorial advantage.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5. As such, because the\ndefendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of shouing both actual prejudice and unjustifiable\nGovernment conduct, her motion to dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay should be\ndenied.”\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). (Def. Mots. 3 & ll). In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a protective order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination. Although the defendant styles her request for relief as two separate\n°5 The defendant asks the Court for leave to supplement her motion “after the government provides\nher with meaningful discovery” and notes that “after the disclosure of meaningful discovery, [she]\nmay request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not\nbeen dismissed on other grounds.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\ninvitation to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS),\n2olo WL 289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July l3, 2olo) (“The motion to dismiss the Indictment as the\nresult of pre-indictment delay is therefore denied, without prejudice to appropriately supported\nlater motion practice.”); United States v. Drago, No. l8 Cr. o394 (SJF) (AYS), 2ol9 WL 3o72288,\nat *2 (E.D.N.Y.

As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 239\n\nOn or about April 9, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon granted the Government’s application\nand issued a memorandum and order.

She evaluated\nthe factors under Second Circuit case law that are relevant to assessing whether a party’s reliance\non the protective order was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, namely the scope of the protective order, the language of\nthe order itself, the court’s level of inquiry before granting the order, and the nature of reliance on\nthe order.

Chief Judge McMahon noted that, as the order\n“plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure to anyone—law\nenforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic\npermission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s\nscrutiny.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\nAs to the last factor, Chief Judge McMahon found that “the nature of the parties’ reliance\non the order does seem to weigh against modification.” (/d. at 2o).

Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the\nprotective order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional\ncircumstances or a compelling need.

She concluded that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the protective order was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and\n“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn concluded that “the\nGovernment must demonstrate not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that\nthe reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to\nmodify the Protective Order.

Kentucky, 448\nU.S. 98, lo4 (l98o).\n\nUnder the third party doctrine, the Fourth Amendment “does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by [the third party] to Government authorities.”\nUnited States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (l976). The Supreme Court has long held that “a person\nhas no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (l979), “even if the information is revealed on the\nassumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose,” Miller, 425 U.S. 435, at 443.\nExceptions to the applicability of the third party doctrine are narrou. For example, in Carpenter,\nl38 S. Ct. at 222o, the Supreme Court declined to extend the third party doctrine to cell site\nlocation information, holding that “a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a\nlegitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.” l38 S. Ct. at 2222. Houever, the\nCourt stressed that its holding was “a narrou one,” with specific consideration given to “the unique\nnature of cell phone location information,” id. at 222o, which “provides an intimate windou into\na person’s life,” id. at 22l7.\n\n“The law is clear that the burden on the defendant to establish [Fourth Amendment]\nstanding is met only by sworn evidence, in the form of affidavit or testimony, from the defendant\nor someone with personal knouledge.” United States v.

The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v.

Indeed, the good faith exception does\nnot apply only in four narrou circumstances:\n\n(l) where the issuing magistrate has been knouingly misled; (2)\nwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial\nrole; (3) where the application is so lacking in indicia of probable\ncause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the\nwarrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nUnited States v.

Discussion\nThe exclusionary rule and its remedy of suppression should not apply here, as the\nGovernment issued a grand jury subpoena; sought the materials after applying to the district court\nfor an order to modify the civil protective order; and only obtained the materials after the district\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2o of 239\nconsidered the Government’s application and then issued a lengthy opinion ruling on that\napplication, the Government was entirely <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in its understanding that the order was lawful.\nIt was therefore similarly <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> for the Government to obtain materials from Boies Schiller\nin response to the subpoena that had been analyzed and blessed by a court order. The Government\nacted with an “objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> good-faith belief’ that its conduct was lawful and in\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance on the district court’s order. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at l43 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omited).\n\nc. Suppression of Certain Materials Would Be Improper Under\nthe Inevitable Discovery Doctrine\nTo the extent materials the Government obtained from Boies Schiller have nou been\nunsealed and posted on the public docket, there is no basis to suppress such materials because the\nGovernment would have inevitably been able to access them upon unsealing.\ni. Applicable Law\nUnder the inevitable discovery doctrine, “evidence that was illegally obtained will not be\nsuppressed ‘if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably’\neven if there had been no statutory or constitutional violation.” United States v. Roberts, 852 F.2d\n67l, 675-76 (2d Cir. l988) (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 43l, 447 (l984)). When a claim of\ninevitable discovery is raised, the court must “determine, viewing affairs as they existed at the\ninstant before the unlawful search occurred, what would have happened had the unlawful search\nnever occurred.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citation omited) (emphasis in original); see also United\nStates v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (The application of the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine “turns on a central question: Would the disputed evidence inevitably have been found\nthrough legal means ‘but for’ the constitutional violation? If the answer is ‘yes,’ the evidence\nseized will not be excluded.”).\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 239\nb. Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In Valentine, the\ndefendant was convicted of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o. The Second Circuit reversed\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 239\n\nA.

List all the people under the age of l8 that you interacted with at\nany of Jeffrey’s properties?\nA. I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than\nobviously Virginia who was l7 at this point?\n\n(Ex. lo at 382:4-384:2o).\n\nThe defendant argues that this question was “grossly ambiguous: who was ‘Jeffrey’; what\nwere ‘Jeffrey’s properties;’ to what time frame did the question apply; what was the basis for Ms.\nMaxwell to determine who may or may not have been ‘under the age of l8’; and what did ‘interact\nwith’ mean?” (Def. Mot. 4 at ll). These arguments only underscore the principle that perjury\nprosecutions are an inquiry into “the natural meaning in the context in which words were used,”\nBonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l, and not an opportunity for defense counsel to “plumb[] a question\nfor post hoc ambiguity,” Strohm, 67l F.3d at ll78. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> jury, after hearing the evidence,\ncould readily conclude that the natural meaning of those words in context is abundantly clear. For\ninstance, at the end of trial, a jury could conclude that “Jeffrey” is Jeffrey Epstein; “Jeffrey’s\nproperties” are Jeffrey Epstein’s properties, including his houses in Palm Beach, New York, New\nMexico, and the United States Virgin Islands (see, e.g., Ex. lo at 248:l7-2o (naming those\nproperties)); and “interact” is an expansive word aimed at capturing any encounter, that was used\nafter the defendant resisted words like “met,” “found,” and “hired” in the prior questions, see\nInteract, Oxford English Dictionary Online, htps://oed.com/view/Entry/975l8 (last visited\nFebruary 25, 2o2l) (“To act reciprocally, to act on each other.”).

See, e.g., Indictment\n§{ 7(a) (“MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-l on multiple occasions at\nEpstein’s residences.”). Accordingly, a rational juror, after hearing the evidence, could find that\nthe question called for the names of minors that the defendant interacted with at any of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s properties, that the defendant answered that she was aware of no such minors other than\nGiuffre, and therefore that her answer was false. And even if the defendant identifies some\nplausible ambiguity—and she has not—the terms in this question are ones “with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree,” and therefore are not fundamentally ambiguous.\nLighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThe defendant points out that, in response to an earlier question asking her to list the\nunderage girls she “met and brought” to Epstein’s house, she said that she could not do so. (Def.\nMot. 4 at l2-l3). She argues that the charged question was “improper” because it asked her to\ngenerate a list “from events that had happened nearly two decades previously.” (/d.). Her\nunpersuasive after-the-fact efforts to justify her answer provide no basis to keep this question from\nthe jury. As noted above, the transcript makes clear (and a jury could find) that when the defendant\ndid not understand or could not answer a question, she said so. To the extent the defendant is\narguing that her answer was literally true, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> jury could find otherwise. In this respect,\nthe Government notes, among other things, that in response to the earlier question, the defendant\nsaid that she could not make a list not because she could not remember events from that long ago\nbut “because that list -- it never happened that I can think of.” (Ex. lo at 382:4-l3) (emphasis\nadded). And in response to the charged question, the defendant said that she “was not aware of\nanybody” under l8—that is, the list would be empty. See Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d at 4l3 (“Olivieri,\nif truly confused, could also have asked for clarification.

She asks, for instance, whether “bath oil” would count as a sex toy or device. (/d.). Yet this\nargument is simply another atempt to imbue ambiguity after the fact into commonly used words\nwith common sense meanings. The mere fact that a term could apply equally to several different\nobjects does not automatically mean that the question is impermissibly vague and can never form\nthe basis of a perjury charge. See, e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Positivism and the Separation of Law and\nMorals, 7l Harv. L. Rev. 593, 6o7 (l958) (“A legal rule forbids you to take a vehicle into the\npublic park.

Counts Two and Four, charging violations of l8 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,\nsimilarly contain the elements of those offenses and adequately inform the defendant of the charges\n°° Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout the Indictment do not\nconstitute illegal behavior. In this vein, the defendant makes specific reference to “grooming” as\nconduct that is not illegal. (Def. Mot. l2 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,\nwhich is contrary to Second Circuit law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many years\nfound grooming behavior to be a means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in illegal\nsexual activity. See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d l55, l73 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (“Our\nprecedent, houever, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that\ndefinition would reasonably include Thompson’s grooming of the minor victims to act as he\ndesired with regard to many maters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.\nDorvee, 6l6 F.3d l74, l8o (2d Cir. 2olo) (“We do not believe that the district court was clearly\nerroneous in finding, as a mater of fact, that these images were sent as part of a grooming process\nto persuade the agent to engage in the type of sexual conduct depicted in the images.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omited)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d l79, 2o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Brand’s sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the\njury’s finding that Brand atempted to entice a minor.”’).

Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

Discussion\n\nThe Government’s decision to seek an indictment of the defendant from a grand jury siting\nin White Plains was entirely appropriate and consistent with the Constitution, the JSSA, and the\nSDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest on a faulty premise: That a\ndefendant who is likely to be tried in the Manhatan courthouse must be indicted by a grand jury\nsiting in that same courthouse. That is not the law. See Section XI.C.l, infra.\n\nThat foundational error is fatal to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the proper\ncomparators are considered—the White Plains Master (or Qualified) Wheels to the voting age\npopulation of the counties from which juries in White Plains are drawn, rather than the defendant’s\napples-to-oranges comparison of the White Plains Qualified Jury Wheel to the population of the\nManhatan “Division”’—the defendant fails to establish unfair underrepresentation under the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. Moreover, the defendant has not established that any disparity\nresulted from systemic exclusion of a particular group. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nl. The Defendant Was Properly Indicted by a Grand Jury Siting in\nWhite Plains\n\nAt the heart of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim is her contention that the\n\nGovernment seeking an indictment from a grand jury siting in White Plains—which was the only\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 239\n\nIn sum, the decision to indict the defendant in White Plains was entirely proper, and the\nlack of any constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s contrary argument is fatal to her\nfair cross-section claims, as described belou.\n\nDe The Defendant’s Fair Cross-Section Claim Is Meritless\n\nThe defendant’s fair cross-section claim is based on the assertion that Black or African-\nAmerican and Hispanic or Latino individuals are unfairly underrepresented in the relevant jury\npool. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5). While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Duren’s first prong, the\ndefendant’s claim fails on each of the other two prongs.\n\na. The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics\nAre Unfairly Represented\n\nThe second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation\nof either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nThis requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what\nis the community “population” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method\nof statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.\n\nHere, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Qualified\nWheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White\nPlains Master Wheel, but, as set forth belou, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White\nPlains Qualified Wheel.\n\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995). Ina\ndetailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different\nrelevant pools, including the master wheel, the qualified wheel over a period of time, the venires\n\n2o5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 348\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.*®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials.

OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\nproof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office. With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerms about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 348\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®® Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nI. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court. Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[iJn many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3332", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3336", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by <span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. *™\n\nB.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel.

The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3444", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 269 of 348\nleters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 273 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nI.

The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “‘in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Jd. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3695", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003696.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3696", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the ‘inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately\npresented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003705.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require resolution\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above\nmaterials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of l6\none “conditions” questions were all medical in nature. The twenty-second and twenty-third\nquestions, houever, inquired about convictions (one about “traffic convictions,” the other about\n“other convictions”). Manapat answered in the negative to both question twenty-two and\nquestion twenty-three, and these answers became the basis for his prosecution for “knouingly\nand willfully” making false statements to any department or agency of the United States. In\naffirming the district court's decision to dismiss the indictment, the Eleventh Circuit stated:\n\nAlthough the single statements “Record of traffic convictions,” or “Record of other\nconvictions” may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing\nwhen buried in a list headed “Medical History” and purportedly concerned with\nmedical conditions....

Earp, 8l2 F.2d 9l7, 9l9\n(4th Cir. l987) (“The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness doun to the\nspecific object of the questioner's inquiry.”); United States v.

No\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude otherwise.\nIn United States v. Ruedlinger, 99o F. Supp. l295, l3o3-o4 (D.

At the first court hearing on the case, the Court alloued Jane Doe #2 to also join the\naction. Both Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to\nprotect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice, and to be treated with\nfairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #l\nand Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court\nconcluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 even though federal\ncharges were never filed.

Both arguments fail.\n\nl. The Relevant “Community” for Comparison Purposes Is the Manhatan Counties\nor, in the Alternative, the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe second prong of Duren asks whether a group’s representation in the source from\nwhich juries are selected is “fair and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in relation to the number of such persons in the\ncommunity.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364. “Although the Duren court did not clearly define the term\n‘community,’ it is generally accepted that the term refers to the district or division where the trial\nis to be held.” United States v.

While the provision\ngranting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions “in this\nDistrict,” NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation.\n\n“TW |here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended\ndifferent meanings.” Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v.

Thus, the appropriate inference here is that the parties intended to limit Epstein’s\nimmunity, but not immunity for potential co-conspirators, to prosecutions in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”).\n\nThe government offers no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> alternative explanation for the contrasting language\nin the two provisions. Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein’s immunity to\nthe SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ immunity to the SDFL as well, but\nmust have forgoten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of\ndifferent language in parallel provisions compels an inference that identical, rather than different\nmeanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head.

Here, the NPA contains only two immunity provisions: one for Epstein, which\nis expressly limited to the SDFL, and one for co-conspirators, which is not. The government’s\nclaim that this distinction reflects an intent to apply the limitation universally strains credulity.°\nIt is simply inconceivable that any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> prosecutor who intended to limit the co-\nconspirator immunity provision to the SDFL—and who had thought to include precisely such\nlimiting language in Epstein’s immunity provision—would have found it unnecessary to include\nidentical language in the co-conspirator immunity provision. Indeed, the omission reveals an\nintent not to so limit that provision.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening memorandum pointed out a second indication in the text of the\nNPA that the parties intended to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL:\nwhere a provision in the NPA is intended to refer only to the USAO-SDFL, it does so explicitly.\nSee Mem. at 8-9 (citing examples of NPA’s explicit references to USAO-SDFL). While the\ngovernment is correct that the use of the term “the United States” in a plea agreement, without\nmore, is insufficient under Annabi and its progeny to demonstrate an intent to bind other\ndistricts, the NPA’s references to both the USAO-SDFL and “the United States” require an\ninference that a distinction between the two is intended—and that where “the United States” is\nused, the intent is to refer to the government as a whole. Again, “where contract provisions use\ndifferent language, courts must assume the parties intended different meanings.” Bank of New\nYork Mellon Trust Co., 82l F.3d at 3o9.

No. 2o5-2, at lo-ll\n(S.D. Fla.)). But the cited passage in that brief argued only that the NPA did not bar the prosecution of Epstein in\nother districts, which is not in dispute; it made no such argument with respect to the prosecution of potential co-\nconspirators. In any event, any self-serving atempts by the USAO-SDFL to limit the NPA’s applicability years\nafter it was executed—after the NPA had been widely criticized and scrutinized—are no more probative of the\nparties’ intent in 2oo7 than the arguments made by the government here.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3886", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel4of23\nalternative explanation for this difference in terminology, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> or otherwise—presumably\nbecause it cannot.\n\nThus, a drafting prosecutor who intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL clearly knew hou to do so, using either of two methods employed elsewhere in the\ndocument. The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDEL, as it did\nelsewhere in the NPA, and provided that “the United States Atorney’s Office . .. will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Again, it did\nnot. It would be absurd to conclude that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> alternative explanation for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision. But to the extent there remains any doubt, plea\nagreements must be construed “strictly against the government,” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89\n(internal citations omited), and the government is held “responsible for imprecisions or\nambiguities in the agreement.” United States v. Padilla, l86 F.3d l36, l42 (2d Cir. l999).\nWhile the government argues that Annabi relieves it of this responsibility where the\n“imprecisions or ambiguities” relate to the geographic applicability of a plea agreement (Opp. 6\nn.2), it cites no authority for this proposition. While Annabi requires an affirmative appearance\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3887", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l7 of 23\nThe other two documents remain unavailable to Ms. Maxwell—as, presumably, do other\ndocuments whose existence cannot be discovered in the public record. Nor has Ms. Maxwell\nhad the opportunity to question those involved in the investigation and negotiation. It is patently\nunreasonable for the government to blame Ms. Maxwell for failing to produce evidence relating\nto the investigation and negotiation leading up to the NPA, while simultaneously opposing her\nrequest for discovery and cherry-picking its responses to the limited publicly available\ninformation she has been able to identify. That limited information has already yielded\nsupportive documents and more will no doubt follou with further discovery.\nWil. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision Is Not Limited to the 2ool-o7 Time Period\n\nor to Violations of Specific Statutes.\n\nThe government’s argument that the co-conspirator immunity provision does not apply to\nthe time period or the offenses charged in the Indictment consists of (l) asserting that the NPA\nsays things it does not, in fact, say and (ll) atacking a strawman position, never asserted by Ms.\nMaxwell, that the NPA gives Ms. Maxwell carte blanche immunity from federal prosecution for\nall past and future criminal conduct of any kind, wherever and whenever commited. The co-\nconspirator immunity provision simply does not contain the limitations the government nou\nseeks to atribute to it, and Ms. Maxwell’s position that it prohibits the Mann Act charges against\nher is entirely <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.*\n\nFirst, the government’s assertion that “the NPA contains detailed provisions that limit the\nscope of the crimes immunized in the agreement” is simply not true. See Opp. l5. The NPA\ncontains only vague limitations as to the scope of Epstein’s immunity, and no limitations\nwhatsoever as to the scope of immunity for potential co-conspirators.\n\n* To be clear, Ms. Maxwell does not assert that the NPA forecloses the perjury counts of the Indictment, which arise\nout of alleged post-NPA conduct.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo389o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel3oofl7\nimprobable that instructions would eliminate the obvious and substantial prejudice to Ms.\nMaxwell.

(Dkt. No. 2o7).\nA. Overview\nThe Government takes its discovery and disclosure obligations seriously, and it has\nendeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the\npendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its discovery and\ndisclosure plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks\nAct obligations with respect to the materials already in the possession of the prosecution team, but\nthat it also makes <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the\nfiles of other investigative agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was\nformulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3955", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nto those other agency files in an October 7, 2o2o leter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information\nhere in order to provide context for what, and hou the Government has reviewed files for material\nrelated to the NPA.\n\nIn sum, the Government has not identified any materials within its possession that would\nconstitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to\nwhich “there is a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v. West Virginia, 547 U.S. 867,\n87o (2oo6). With this definition in mind, the Government would view any evidence that the NPA\nwas intended to (l) bind other U.S. Atorneys in other districts; or (ll) cover Maxwell specifically,\nas “evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA” that it would be required to disclose.\n(See April l6, 2o2l Opinion, Dkt. No. 2o7, at 8, 3-7 (discussing the bases for Maxwell’s motion\nunder the NPA)). As set forth in more detail belou, the Government has not identified any such\nevidence in its possession.\n\nThe Government does not, houever, view any other materials that are simply re/ated to the\nNPA as materials it is required to disclose in this case, either under Rule l6 or Brady.\nNevertheless, and as the Court recognized, the defendant already has access to a large swath of\ninformation that the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR’’)\ncompiled as a result of their thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the\nnegotiation of the NPA, and the Government has not sought to, nor would it be obligated to, redo\nOPR’s work. (Dkt. No. 2o7, at 8 (noting the “extensive OPR report” and that “No record evidence\nsuggests that prosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing.”’).\nIn the interest of clarity, the Government sets forth belou a description of the materials it has\ncompiled and reviewed, and will continue to review, for potential Brady material in this case, while\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3956", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl3\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril 22, 2o2l\nPage 5\nwould mandate a continuance. Ms. Maxwell must nou: search various records (to the extent they\nare available) and track doun numerous witnesses to determine her locations and activities\nduring this expanded period. She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations. These\nare time consuming and difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial of a\ncontinuance under these circumstances would constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy. Guzman's\nconviction on the conspiracy count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the conspiracy was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of discretion. By\ncontrast, the denial of a continuance may be upheld in cases where the changes to the indictment\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3992", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004000.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page l3 ofl3\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril 22, 2o2l\nPage l3\nLike the Court, I fully recognize that a superseding indictment may add to a defendant's\nburden in preparing for trial. In the event of additional charges, or of material changes, a\ndefendant well may need additional preparation time. Under the Act, a defendant then\nmay seek an \"ends of justice\" continuance, to be granted in the discretion of the trial\ncourt. See l8 U.S.C. 3l6l(h)(8)(A). This continuance is available whether the need for\nadditional time is occasioned by a superseding indictment or otherwise.\nIndeed, the l979 amendments to the Speedy Trial Act not only mandated the 3o-day\ndefense-preparation period, but also provided that one basis for granting a continuance is\nif \"the failure to grant such a continuance . . . would deny counsel for the defendant. . .\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> time necessary for effective preparation.\" l8 U.S.C. 3l6l(h)(8)(B)(iv).\nThe constitutional right to assistance of counsel is rendered meaningless if a defendant is\nforced to trial in the absence of adequate time to prepare. To avoid prejudicing a\ndefendant, a continuance should be granted where there is a meaningful possibility that a\nsuperseding indictment will require an alteration or adjustment in the planned defense.\nTrial courts should bear in mind that counsel may require time fully to analyze the impact\nof the superseding indictment, and to explore any options it presents or precludes.\nId. at 24o-4l.\nBased on the foregoing and consistent with the holding in United States v.

Aguilar, No. CR o7-ooo3o (SBA), 2oo8 WL 3l82o29, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug.\n4, 2oo8). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary\nincentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are\nbeing sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be\nimpeachment evidence does not render them “relevant” for purposes of Rule l7(c); if at all, those\ndocuments would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2ol8 WL 2254538,\nat *2. Maxwell’s argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is\nexculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or\nwhen those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are\nexculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for\npurposes of cross-examination, leaving litle doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And\nto the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be\nexculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why\nthat expectation might be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. The “mere hope” that the documents may contain some\nexculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule l7(c) subpoena (or, as here,\nissuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-\n579 (SWK), l984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the Government’s obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment\nevidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2-\n3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request l2’s compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell\nmay renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose\nsubmissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At\nthat time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require production of these materials to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 254 _ Filed o4/29/2l Pagelof2\nN)*| Sea SS ]*IN U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nNS Agi Federal Bureau of Prisons\nSS ra Metropolitan Detention Center\nSSS\n8o 29% Street usDcSDXNY ~~ —*&~d\nBrooklyn, New York ll232 DOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: =\nApril 28, 2o2l DATE FILED: 4/29/2l |\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Visiting Room Officers inspect the legal materials for contraband. Inmates are not\npermited to carry out any items other than those they were alloued to be take into the Visiting\nRoom.

And,\nimportantly, any victims and the public more broadly have a strong interest in trial proceeding\nwithout undue delay. It is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case proceed to that trial as\nexpeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and all relevant\ncircumstances. See l8 U.S.C. §3l6l(h)(7)(A); l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nHaving balanced all of the factors outlined above, the Court concludes that the interests\nof justice justify granting a short continuance.

Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to\nprepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also\nensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay.

Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 4\nI. The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (l975). See also\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (l984) (“Government violates the right to effective\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page5of7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 5\nassistance when it interferes in certain ways with the ability of counsel to make independent\ndecisions about hou to conduct the defense.”’).\n\nIf the court were to act outside its statutory authority and compel defense counsel to\ndisclose defense material prematurely, then Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights\nwould be endangered. While the aims of judicial economy and efficiency may be served by\nordering the defense to disclose prospective witnesses, such policy goals, houever laudable,\ncannot trump fundamental liberties. “In the administration of criminal justice, courts must\ncarefully guard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative\nevidence and beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Estelle, 425 U.S. at 5o3.\n\nII. Procedural Rules Aside, the Government Must Timely Disclose Any Brady and\n\nGiglio Material.\n\nBrady and its progeny impose upon the government broad duties of disclosure. See Brady\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (l963) (“the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable\nto an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or\nto punishment”); United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (l985) (defining materiality);\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 28l-82 (l999) (same); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o,\nl54 (l972) (government has duty to disclose material affecting reliability of government\nwitnesses).\n\nThe court’s authority, or lack thereof, to order disclosures under Rules l6 and 26.2 does\nnot affect the defendant’s right to Brady material. “It is, of course, a fundamental axiom of\nAmerican law, rooted in our history as a people and requiring no citations to authority, that the\nrequirements of the Constitution prevail over a statute in the event of a conflict.” Coppa, 267\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 _ Filed o5/o3/2l Page 6of7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 6\nF.3d at l45—46. Nor do the procedural and statutory rules affect the defense’s right to Brady\ninformation prior to trial. See Docket No. 68 (“The Government shall disclose [Brady]\ninformation to the defense promptly after its existence becomes knoun to the Government so\nthat the defense may make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case.”);\naccord Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); United States v.

Evidence may, or may not, be necessary after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\npossession of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a production schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute. Production in\nadvance of trial will also ensure adequate time for the Government to file any relevant motions\nand to prepare any rebutal case as appropriate.

Feb. 25,\n2o2l) (finding that the district court “considered the unavailability of the prosecutor when granting\nthe continuance, as it was entitled to do under the Speedy Trial Act” and “reasonably conclud[ed]\nthat a small delay was justified” in “balanc[ing] the need for a speedy trial with the efficiencies of\ncontinuity of counsel”). Given the complexities in this case, including a large volume of discovery,\ncomplex litigation history, years of investigation, and significant time invested with victim-\nwitnesses, continuity of Government counsel at trial is a particularly compelling interest here. The\nGovernment respectfully submits that a trial before November 29, 2o2l would be prejudicial to\nthe Government and the interests of justice. The Government respectfully submits that the\nGovernment’s proposed trial date—which is only three weeks after the date requested by the\ndefense—is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in light of the interests described above and where defense counsel\noriginally requested a continuance of trial to November 8, 2o2l contingent upon the re-scheduling\nof a conflicting trial and alternatively requested a trial date of January lo, 2o22.4 (Dkt. No. 246).\n\nAdditionally, the Government respectfully proposes the follouing adjustment to the pre-\ntrial schedule in place.

Ex. J.\n\ne Defense 4: There was only one meeting.\n\nThe government denies there was a second meeting between the U.S. Atorney’s Office\nand Giuffre’s atorneys. Resp. at 92. This denial, though, is based solely on AUSA\nfoggy memory and in the absence of any credible investigation. Contrary to the government’s\nclaim, the evidence strongly suggests there was a second meeting or some further contact\nbetween them. At the very least, this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing to find the truth.\n\n'© Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6, New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o),\nhtps:/Awww.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzderbbs7ycobfnszu-story.html.\n\nTo the extent the article relies on unnamed sources, there is no indication those sources are\nanonymous in the sense that the author is unaware of their identity.

OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6o of 349\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 72 of 349\nproof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office. With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment. This Office should seek to foster spirited\ndebate about the law and the use of prosecutorial discretion... .\n[M]y first and only concern in this case (and my other child\nexploitation cases) is the victims. If our personality differences\nthreaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case\nwhom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights.\nIn the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to\nbegin preparing a revised indictment package containing your\nsuggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by\nEpstein’s atorneys... . If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou. ”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.””, Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 78 of 349\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafaia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n8 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 79 of 349\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S. Morford to Heads of Departmental Components and\nUnited States Atorneys at n.2 (Mar. 7, 2oo8), available at htps://Awww justice. gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-\nmanual-l63-selection-and-use-monitors. Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9o of 349\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo9 of 349\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB.

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4443", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l57 of 349\nis subject to all rules of the court.!?? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nZe FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4454", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by <span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o8 of 349\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l8 of 349\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.*“4\n\nB.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.\nConst. art. I, § l6(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims\nare given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the\nvictim[.]” Fla.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4565", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 269 of 349\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”3®\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 274 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nI.

The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 293 of 349\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent— Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Discussion\n\nMaxwell objects both to the Government obtaining documents covered by the protective\norder and to the Government’s conduct in doing so. She contends that she agreed to testify in the\ncivil case only because of the protective order, and thus that the Government’s use of her\ndeposition testimony against her would violate her right against compelled self-incrimination.\nShe contends that she had a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in the documents covered by the\nprotective order, and thus that the Government should not have been able to obtain them without\na warrant. And she contends that the Government circumvented the requirements of Martindell\nand violated her due process rights by misleading Judge McMahon about the Government’s prior\ncommunications with BSF.\n\nThe Court finds that none of these arguments support suppression of evidence or justify\nan evidentiary hearing. The Court begins with Maxwell’s claim that the Government violated\nher right against compelled self-incrimination by obtaining her deposition testimony from the\ncivil case. It next turns to her claim that the Government violated her right against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Finally, it addresses Maxwell’s claim that the Government misled Judge\nMcMahon in seeking modification of the protective order in the earlier civil case.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4789", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page/7of2l\nor modified by another court in another proceeding. /d. A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil protective order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; Giuffre v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil protective order against the use of their testimony in a\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page9of2l\n396 U.S. at 82. In these circumstances, the Fifth Amendment does not bar the Government’s use\nof her testimony in a prosecution for perjury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell is not entitled to suppress her deposition\ntranscripts based on her right against compelled self-incrimination.\n\nB. Maxwell had no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in documents produced in\n\ncivil litigation\n\n“The Fourth Amendment protects ‘[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.’” Carpenter v. United\nStates, l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l3 (2ol8) (alteration in original) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV).\nGovernment activity qualifies as a search under the Fourth Amendment only if it involves a\nphysical intrusion into a constitutionally protected space or the violation of a person’s\n“<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy.” United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 4oo, 4o6-o7 (2ol2)\n(quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 36o (l967) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Thus,\ngovernment agents need a warrant to rummage through someone’s home, listen in on their phone\ncalls, or search through their phones seized incident to arrest. The Fourth Amendment imposes\nno limitation on their ability to gather evidence of public activity or review public records.\n\nA person has a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy only if they seek to keep something\nprivate and have an objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation that it will remain private. Smith v.\nMaryland, 442 U.S. 735, 74o (l979). The Supreme Court has held that people generally lack a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in information they voluntarily disclose to others. See id. at\n743-44; United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 44o (l976). This is true even if they expect that\ninformation to be safeguarded and used only for specific purposes. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nheld that police may obtain bank records or a list of phone numbers a person has dialed without a\nwarrant. Smith, 442 U.S. at 742; Miller, 425 U.S. at 44o. Ina lone exception to this rule, the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4793", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pageloof2l\nSupreme Court has held that people have a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in geographical\ninformation obtained from their cell phones, because that information provides a comprehensive\naccount of a person’s movements akin to invasive physical surveillance. See Carpenter, l38 S.\nCt. at 22l9-2o.\n\nUnder this standard, Maxwell had no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in the documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Those documents may not have been public, but they were\nhardly private. The protective order alloued them to be shared freely with each of the follouing\ncategories of people:\n\ne The parties to the case.\n\ne Atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne People employed by or associated with atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne Expert witnesses.\n\ne Fact witnesses.\n\ne Potential witnesses.\n\ne Court personnel and stenographers.\nIt also alloued any documents to be publicly used at trial. This is not a case like Carpenter\nwhere new technology has alloued police to access heretofore “unknouable” information about\na person’s private life. /d. at 22l8. This is a case where Maxwell shared information with third\nparties through the routine process of civil litigation and nou objects that they shared it with the\nGovernment, too.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent makes clear that Maxwell had no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation that\ndocuments covered by the protective order would remain shielded from view of the public or\nprosecutors. The Second Circuit has cautioned civil litigants that a civil protective order is no\nguarantee against the use of evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. See Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Second Circuit precedent allous a court in a subsequent proceeding to modify a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4794", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagellof2l\nprotective order. /d. And if confidential materials turn out to be relevant to a court’s ruling,\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that they will be made public\nnotwithstanding any protective order. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. These are not remote or\ntheoretical possibilities. Each of them predictably came to pass in this case. See Broun, 929\nF.3d at 48 & n.22; Giuffre, 827 F. App’x at l45. It is “unrealistic” to believe that deposition\ntestimony central to a civil case of high public interest will remain effectively sealed indefinitely.\nAndover, 876 F.2d at lo83.\n\nMaxwell claims that she did not expect the Government to be able to obtain her\ndeposition testimony, and that if she knew it would, she never would have testified. If Maxwell\nsubjectively harbored this belief, it was nonetheless unreasonable. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743.\nThe Court further notes that Maxwell was ably represented by a number of atorneys during the\ncivil litigation, who the Court is confident were familiar with the precedents governing protective\norders and public access to judicial documents.\n\nBecause Maxwell had no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectation of privacy in documents shared with\nthird parties during the civil case, the Government did not engage in a search when it obtained\nthose documents from a third party by subpoena. Maxwell also makes a half-hearted argument\nthat obtaining those documents was a seizure of her personal property. Copies of documents\nheld by a law firm that represented Maxwell’s adversary in a civil case were not Maxwell’s\npersonal property. Thus, the Government engaged in neither a search nor a seizure, and so it did\nnot violate Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe Government also contends that even if it improperly obtained documents pursuant to\nthe grand jury subpoena, the Court should not suppress those documents because the\nGovernment acted in good faith and would have obtained the documents anyway. See Nix v.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel7 of 2l\ncommunications between BSF and the Government related to Epstein or Maxwell. But an\nequally plausible understanding of the phrase “‘on the subject of your investigation” is “related to\nthe investigation itself.” That interpretation is all the more <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in context, because\nChemical Bank involved communications between a party subject to a protective order and\nprosecutors during a pending criminal investigation. See Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. It\nwas not unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that Judge McMahon was concerned with\nthose sorts of communications, not communications years earlier that did not lead to a criminal\ninvestigation. The Government has represented that its present investigation into Epstein (and\nlater Maxwell) began only follouing publication of the Miami Herald expose in 2ol8. Maxwell\nhas made no substantial preliminary shouing to the contrary.\n\nThe Court also concludes that Maxwell has made no substantial preliminary shouing that\nJudge McMahon would have denied the Government’s application to modify the protective order\nif she knew about the 2ol6 communications. Materiality under Franks requires more than that a\nfact be important. It allous suppression only if “the allegedly false statement is necessary” to\nthe court’s finding. Franks, 438 U.S. at l56 (emphasis added). If Judge McMahon would still\nhave ruled that the Government was entitled to ex parte modification of the protective order even\nafter seting aside the Government’s alleged misrepresentation, then Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression. Judge McMahon’s opinion reflects that she would have.\n\nJudge McMahon’s ruling rested on two independent grounds. Analyzing the\nGovernment’s application under Martindell, she first held that Maxwell could not have\nreasonably relied on the protective order to keep the Government from obtaining documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Judge McMahon reasoned that a civil litigant ordinarily may\nnot rely on a protective order subject to modification to keep evidence out of the hands of\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors. As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court thus finds that Maxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing under\neither prong of Franks, and thus that she is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\nprotective order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)). Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\ncircumstances to modify the protective order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon concluded that modification was necessary under the circumstances to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation. Although <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> minds may differ—indeed, Judge Netburn reached the\nopposite conclusion—there was a substantial basis for Judge McMahon’s decision and it is thus\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o9 _ Filed o7/ol/2l Page2of3\nHonorable Alison J.

He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A.

Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\nthe need arise.

We don’t charge people with making\na mistake or doing something foolish;” houever, he indicated that it is a true\nstatement.\n\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, [Cosby] gave a full statement to law\nenforcement and his Pennsylvania and New York homes were searched.\n[Cosby] was accompanied by counsel and did not invoke the Fifth\nAmendment at any time during the statement. After [Cosby's] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the\npolice. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips\nthought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to\nobtain the records. Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand\nafter the assault. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire\ninterceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, allegations made by other women were\nalso investigated. Mr. Castor delegated that investigation to Ms. Ferman.\nHe testified that he determined that, in his opinion, these allegations were\nunreliable.\nFollouing approximately one month of investigation, Mr. Castor concluded\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidenced upon which\nany charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident could be\nproven beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” He testified that he could either leave\nthe case open at that point or definitively close the case to allou a civil case.\nHe did not believe there was a chance that the criminal case could get any\nbeter. He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys. He testified that\nshe was to contact the atorneys to let them knou that “Cosby was not going\nto be prosecuted and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 49 of 8o\ncredibility issues, and the absence of direct or corroborative proof by which to substantiate\nher claim, led the district atorney to believe that the case presented “insufficient, credible,\nand admissible evidence upon which any charge could be sustained beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ndoubt.” Press Release, 2/l7/2oo5 (cleaned up). Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\nCommonwealth, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle\nthat, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\ncircumstances, implicated Cosby’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-4. The trial court’s narrou interpretation of\ninduce a defendant to forfeit a constitutional right, and where the defendant has relied\nupon that decision to his detriment. The dissent’s approach would turn a blind eye to the\nreality of such inducements. Due process does not.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4875", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 69 of 8o\n\nWe already have determined that Cosby in fact relied upon D.A.

Castor to expect Cosby to so rely. The record establishes without contradiction\nthat depriving Cosby of his Fifth Amendment right was D.A. Castor’s intended result.2’\nHis actions were specifically designed to that end. The former district atorney may have\nequivocated or contradicted himself years later with regard to hou he endeavored to\nachieve that result, but there has never been any question as to what he intended to\nachieve. There can be no doubt that, by choosing not to prosecute Cosby and then\n27 The dissent asserts that we have predicated our decision upon the existence of an\n“unwriten promise,” which was rejected by the trial court’s credibility findings. D.O. at 3.\nTo the contrary. As we explained earlier, we have accepted the trial court’s findings in\nthis regard, and those findings, which are supported by the record, are binding on this\nCourt. See, supra, page 48 (citing O’Rourke, 778 A.2d at ll99 (Pa. 2ool)). Houever,\nour deference is limited to the factual findings only; we may draw our oun inferences\ntherefrom and reach our oun legal conclusions. See /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d at 63l.\nThus, the trial court’s factual finding that no formal bargained-for-exchange, writen or\nunwriten, occurred does not constrain our legal analysis, nor does it in any way serve to\nimmunize D.A. Castor’s actions from constitutional scrutiny. That there was no formal\npromise does not mean that Cosby no longer had due process rights.\n\nThe trial court’s credibility finding regarding the existence vel non of a particular\npromise does not allou us to ignore the remainder of the overwhelming evidence of\nrecord. The record firmly establishes that D.A. Castor’s desired result was to strip Cosby\nof his Fifth Amendment rights. This patent and developed fact stands separate and apart\nfrom the trial court’s finding that D.A. Castor never extended a formal promise.\n\nThe dissent would ignore the undeniable reality that Cosby relied to his detriment\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision. The dissent does so by shifting the perspective from D.A.\nCastor’s actions to Cosby’s, focusing in particular upon the fact that Cosby did not record\nthe purported agreement or reduce it to writing. As we note in this opinion, in this context,\nneither a promise, nor an agreement, nor a contract, nor evidence of reliance derives\nlegal validity only upon being recorded or upon writen materialization. The law knous no\nsuch prerequisite, and Cosby cannot be punished for failing to comply with a legal\nrequirement that does not exist. The proof of Cosby’s reliance is plain on the face of the\nrecord. It is the fact that, upon the advice and assistance of counsel, Cosby sat for four\ndepositions and incriminated himself, obviously a decision made after and in direct\nreliance upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law. If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the Commonwealth’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.

This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process. See Roue, 676 F.2d at 528 (explaining that, when\na promise induces a defendant to waive his Fifth Amendment rights by testifying or\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4887", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 76 of 8o\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled). In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 23 |\nl5 |\nXj3qlgra SEALED\na l sign, which is, you can disclose it without the permission of\n2 the Court if, you knou, law enforcement puts a gun to your head\n3 and. says produce it: That's not in here. |\n4 MR.

The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., lo4 |\nF.R.D. 559, 57o (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd, 82l F.2d l39 (2d Cir. l987) (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d |\nat 295). The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004940.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l7 of 27\n.

That, I gather, is the subject of the pending appeal. Press reports of the\noral argument suggest that perhaps the necessary findings might not have been made before\ncertain court filings were sealed. I cannot and will not pretend not to knou that the issue is out\nthere.

If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\nprotective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the Protective Order in deciding |\nwhether and hou to comply with various discovery requests. The question to be decided is |\nwhether such reliance was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494o |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the protective order: (l) the scope of |\nthe protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order. And |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89l |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494l |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nabsence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from\n\na grand jury’s scrutiny. As the court reasoned in EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l, language stating that\nthe party receiving designated confidential information “shall not use or disclose the information |\nexcept... by such orders as may be issued by the Court during the course of this litigation” did\n“not lend itself to <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> reliance that [the Protective Order] will afford permanent secrecy.”\n|\nSee also Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6), where, in view |\nof a provision that said, “This Confidentiality Order shall not prevent anyone from applying to |\n|\nthe Court for relief therefrom,” the Second Circuit held, “Given this provision, it is difficult to |\nsee hou the defendants can reasonably argue that they produced documents in reliance on the |\nfact that the documents would always be kept secret.” |\nThird, there is no evidence before me indicating that the court undertook any sort of |\ndetailed inquiry prior to entering the Protective Order. (Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66 at |\n4:25-5:l2.). Obviously, I was not there, but I have reviewed the transcript of the argument on |\nthe motion for a protective order, and it seems clear that the parties were given ample discretion |\nto designate discovery materials as confidential, with virtually no oversight unless those |\nmaterials were to be filed with the court—in which case a motion for sealing had to be made.° |\n(Protective Order § lo); cf Liton Indus., Inc. v. Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc., l22 F.R.D. 433, |\n435 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (declining to enforce protective order where “the protective order did not |\nadjudicate the appropriateness of confidentiality as to particular items of discovery”).

The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936). Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more difficult to identify and assess when\na prospective juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes. Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case. In the words of a\nfederal appeals judge:\nWe would, as judges, have to ignore what we knou as men to\nassume that only the law and the naked facts carry the burden of\npersuasion.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\nie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo528l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 365 _ Filed lo/22/2l Page 9 of 4o\nJuror ID:\n8.9.

Jurors are also not alloued to do any research regarding this\ncase, whether over the Internet, on social media, or in any other manner.

The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial.

It simply contains the charges that the Government is\nrequired to prove to the satisfaction of the trial jury beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. The charges were\nsummarized in the questionnaire you all filled out. The Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, transported a minor female to engage in criminal sexual activity, and engaged\nin sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nI will summarize the charges again briefly in this case in order to determine whether there\nis anything about the nature of this case that may make it difficult or inappropriate for any of you\nto serve on the jury.\n\nThe Indictment in this case contains six counts or charges:\n\ne Count One of the Indictment charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and\nincluding in or about 2oo4, Ghislaine Maxwell, the defendant, conspired with others to\nentice minors to travel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in sexual activity for\nwhich a person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\ne Count Two charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and including in or about\nl997, Ghislaine Maxwell enticed a minor to travel in interstate and foreign commerce to\nengage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and\naided and abeted the same.\n\ne Count Three charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and including in or about\n2oo4, Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with others to transport minors in interstate and foreign\ncommerce to engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.\n\ne Count Four charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and including in or about\nl997, Ghislaine Maxwell transported minors in interstate and foreign commerce to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and aided and\nabeted the same.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5362", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 367-l Filed lo/22/2l Page 6ofl7\ne Count Five charges that, from at least in or about 2ool, up to and including in or about\n2oo4, Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with Jeffrey Epstein and others to engage in sex\ntrafficking of minors.\ne Count Six charges that, from at least in or about 2ool, up to and including in or about 2oo4,\nGhislaine Maxwell engaged in sex trafficking of minors, and aided and abeted the same.\nll.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 48 of 54\nIX. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her charitable works or evidence of her family history. Such\nevidence should be excluded as irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial.\n\nAs discussed above, the Federal Rules of Evidence preclude the use of good acts to draw\na propensity inference in favor of the defendant, just as they preclude the use of prior bad acts for\nthe same purpose. See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF. App’x 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (“The district court correctly recognized that\nevidence of solitary confinement could be used for the improper purpose of provoking juror\nsympathy.”). Any atempt to encourage such sympathy is therefore an atempt at nullification,\nwhich is itself plainly improper. See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l5 (2d Cir.\nl997) (Jury nullification is “by no means a right or something that a judge should encourage or\npermit if it is within his authority to prevent.”); id. at 6l4 (“We categorically reject the idea that,\nin a society commited to the rule of law, jury nullification is desirable or that courts may permit\nit to occur when it is within their authority to prevent.”); see also United States v. Washington,\n7o5 F.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir. l983) (per curiam) (“A jury has no more ‘right’ to find a ‘guilty’\ndefendant ‘not guilty’ than it has to find a ‘not guilty’ defendant ‘guilty,’ and the fact that the\nformer cannot be corrected by a court, while the later can be, does not create a right out of the\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo544l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 56 of 69\nappropriate and viable defense.

The ill-founded\nmotion should be denied.\n\nA. The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring Pre-trial Notice of Such\n\nEvidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government’s motion for a simple reason: There is\nno authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she\nintends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or\nProcedure make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b), for example,\nimposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert\nwitnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her “absence\nwhen Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s case-in-chief” and then\n“explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.”\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the\ngovernment’s invocation of Rule 4o4(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that\nRule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it\ndesires to admit at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).°?

R. Evid. 4o4(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended in December\n2o2o, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered,\nan articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that\npurpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\nintroduce evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed.

Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 24\n\nFinally, Rocchio’s second opinion is inadmissible under Rules 7o4 and 4o3. It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of exclusion\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. See United States v.

That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse. Rocchio’s opinions on\nthose consequences are irrelevant under Rule 4ol and 4o2, they will not assist the trier of fact in\ndeciding the case, Fed. R.

The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a permanent residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys.

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page4of9\n\nGhislaine Maxwell moves in limine to preclude reference to the accusers as “victims” or\n“minor victims.” Ms. Maxwell moves for an order precluding all trial participants from referring\nto the accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” Instead, all trial participants, including the\nCourt, should refer to all persons by their individual names.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nUnder the United States Constitution, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent unless the\ngovernment proves all elements of the alleged offenses beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. U.S. Const.\namend. V; Jn re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). The presumption of innocence has deep\nhistorical roots and is a core tenet of criminal law. “The principle that there is a presumption of\ninnocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its\nenforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.” Coffin v. United\nStates, l56 U.S. 432, 453 (l895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the law of Athens, Sparta, and\nRome for early versions of the presumption of innocence).\n\nIn some criminal cases, the parties agree that an accuser was the victim of a crime. When,\nfor example, a person is stabbed or shot, there is no dispute that the person was a victim of\nsomething. F.g., Jackson v. State, 6oo A.2d 2l, 24 (Del. l99l) (stating, on appeal from a rape\nconviction, that “[t]he term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that\na crime was commited and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue.”).\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Rather, Ms. Maxwell denies that she victimized anyone.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support her defense. The jury ultimately will have to decide\nwhether the government has proven that these accusers are in fact “victims” or “minor victims.”\nIn advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those terms necessarily conveys\nthe speaker’s opinion that a crime in fact occurred and that the accusers are credible. Conveying\nsuch a personal belief biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, implies a belief in the truthfulness of\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 84\nInstead, the Government will seek to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony as background in this case.\n“Daubert instructs that vigorous cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence are\nthe central tools available to an adversary who wishes to debunk an expert’s testimony.” Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE), Dkt.

Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.\nRocchio’s background testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering\ncontrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury\nunderstand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant\nand Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed disclosure.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\nThe parties agree that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Her opinions are well within the\nrange of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expert opinions, and so are sufficiently reliable to go to the jury.

The Evidence Contained in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l Leter is\n\nAdmissible\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government notified the defense of certain evidence it may offer\nat trial. In particular, the leter addressed and the expected testimony of one potential\nwitness. (See October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A). As the Government explained in its\nleter to the defense, the evidence constitutes direct evidence of the charged offenses, but the\nGovernment provided notice under Rule 4o4(b) in the alternative.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5885", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 45\nl66 McElvaney\ndelay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused’s right\nto a speedy trial.

This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered.

The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Thank you again for your time and service. As I\n\n6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I\n\n7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the\n\n8 first step in the jury selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrou if\nll necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process.\nl2 That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process\nl3. today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\nl4 As you knou from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today\nl5 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As\nl6 you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl7. aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl8 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\nl9 ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent,\n2o and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has\n2l. proven each element of that crime beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n22) Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal\n23 ~~ case is a critical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who\n24 ~—can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. Some people find that they can be fair and\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6o37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o4 _ Filed ll/o2/2l Page4of6\n\nl there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record,\n\n2 please let me knou. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue\n\n3. to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process.\n\n4 Nou, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to\n\n5 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to\n\n6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.\n\n7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here nou, she's presumed to be innocent. She is\n\n8 presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n\n9 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nlo anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\nll can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with\nl2 commiting these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government\nl3. can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not\nl4 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on\nl5 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.\nl6 The next thing is that as jurors you must follou the law as I give it to you, even if you\nl7. don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.\nl8 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in\nl9 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in\n2o ~~ discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on\n2l +something that you might have read or heard about another case.\n22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not\n23 permited to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o7 Filed ll/o3/2l Page4of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\nunderstanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\nunlawful purpose.\n\nThe essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\npeople to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\nthe actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\ncrime of conspiracy.\n\nIn order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\npeople, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nor unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nplan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nconspiracy. If you find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that two or more persons came to an\nunderstanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nthe Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\n\n| To satis this-element ofa conspiracy—namehyte-shou thathea conspiracy existed—\nthe Government is not required to shou that two or more people sat around a table and entered\ninto a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that they had formed a conspiracy to violate the\nlaw and spelling out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when people, in fact, agree to\nenter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a\nconspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit agreement. Conspirators do not\nusually reduce their agreements to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nthey publicly broadcast their plans.\n\nIn determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6ll3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 48 of 93\n\ncircumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\nthe only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a conspiracy is that of\ndisconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\naltogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\nthat a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\nagreement. On this question, you should refer back to my earlier instructions on direct and\ncircumstantial evidence and inferences.\n\nIn short, as far as the first element of the conspiracy is concerned, the Government must This language was used in United States v.

One type of\nevidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct evidence is a witness’s testimony about\nsomething that the witness knous by virtue of his or her oun senses—something that the witness\nhas seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\nThe other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\nevidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\ncircumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\n\nAssume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nwas a nice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nyou cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\ndripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\n\nNou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nraining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nhave asked you to assume, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and logical for you to conclude that between\nthe time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\n\nThat is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\ncommon sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n\nMany facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\nevidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\nthat the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\nthat, before convicting each defendantMs. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied ofeach-\n\ndefendants her guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 65 of 93\nInferences\n\nDuring the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\nterm “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\nbased on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\nexistence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\ninvolves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\nWhat is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\nsuspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\nbased on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\n\nThere are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\ndirect or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nthe defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nwill draw.\n\nThe process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nspeculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nrequired to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nevidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\n\nTherefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nthe facts that you find to be proven, such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences as would be justified in light of\nyour experience.\n\nSome inferences, houever, are impermissible.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page6ofll\nPage 6\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s argument that the strength of the evidence was\ndiminished by her then-pending pre-trial motions (which have since been denied).

The Second Circuit’s Orders\n\nThe defendant filed appeals from the Court’s second and third detention orders. After\nhearing oral argument, the Circuit denied the defendant’s motion for bail in a writen order. (See\nUnited States v. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 86 (2d Cir. Apr. 27, 2o2l)).\n\nFollouing that decision, the defendant submited a leter to this Court asking it “to address\nMs. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing MDC to cease l5-minute light surveillance of Ms.\nMaxwell or justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.” (Dkt. 256 at 2). The Court\npromptly ordered the Government to confer with MDC counsel and provide the Court with an\nexplanation regarding the use of flashlights and the basis for it, which the Government then did.\n(Dkt. 257, 27o). On May l4, 2o2l, this Court issued an order denying the defendant’s request for\nan order directing the MDC to modify its nightime monitoring schedule. (Dkt. 282). In reaching\nthis decision, the Court noted that the defendant’s claim that MDC staff were shining the light\ndirectly into her eyes and disrupting her sleep was “unsupported by affidavit or other factual\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page8of4l\nHe also lists these “pathways,” in terms at times “drawn nearly verbatim” from a 2ol2 article ina\nforensic psychology journal, along with conjectures of ways in which these mental conditions or\ncircumstances could hypothetically lead to false claims of sexual assault, including the follouing\nexamples:\n\ne “Lying”: “Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as the favorable\nconsequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences could be . . . the severe\nnegative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences . .. secondary gain from\nvictim status ... excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases) [or] financial gain.” (Ex.

Indeed, if Dr. Dietz seeks to offer such\ntestimony that false accusations “do occur,” it will open the door for the Government to elicit on\ncross-examination that Dr. Dietz’s principal source, which he relies on “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A\nat 7), concludes that “the most recent more methodologically adequate studies have indicated that\nfalse allegations are somewhat rare” (Ex. C at lol (citing study estimating the frequency of false\nrape allegations between 2% and lo%)).° Of course, the Government’s view is that this entire\ntopic can serve only to distract the jury from its task of determining whether these specific\nallegations are in fact proven beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt, and thus Dr. Dietz should be precluded\nfrom offering this opinion.\n\nMany of the “pathways” Dr. Dietz describes are not just within the ken of the jury, they\nare at the core of the jury’s role. It is not helpful to the jury or permissible under Rule 7o2 for an\nexpert to testify that “lying,” a mistake of “implied consent,” or “intoxication” could lead to a false\naccusation of a crime. Sorting out witness credibility, mistake, or other such circumstances is\nsquarely the function of the jury, which will be instructed by the Court and which does not need\nthe help of a psychiatrist to assess such possibilities. See, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d\n® The Government typically cannot introduce evidence of the statistical infrequency of false\naccusations, but if Dr. Dietz is alloued to create a false impression of their frequency, it is only\nfair to allou the Government to correct the record. United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285, l296\n(2d Cir. l99l) (“The weighing of relevance under Rule 4o3 may be altered when a false impression\nis created by earlier testimony. That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily\noutweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admiss[i]ble to rebut testimony\nelicited on cross examination that created a false impression.” (citations omited)).\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page lo of 29\nlo4 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page3ofl6\nDraft Pre-Voir Dire Remarks — November 8, 2o2l\n\nl United States v.

As\nl7. you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl8 aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl9 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\n2o ofaminor.

A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall irrelevant.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly irrelevant to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely irrelevant,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is irrelevant what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is irrelevant hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct.

Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF.

The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring Pre-trial Notice of Such\n\nEvidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government’s motion for a simple reason: There is\nno authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she\nintends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or\nProcedure make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b), for example,\nimposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert\nwitnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her “absence\nwhen Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s case-in-chief” and then\n“explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.”\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the\ngovernment’s invocation of Rule 4o4(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that\nRule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it\ndesires to admit at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).°? The Rule does not impose a similar obligation\non a defendant.\n\n° The Rule says:\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so\n\nthat the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the\n\nevidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause, excuses\n\nlack of pretrial notice.\n\nFed.

Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 24\n\nFinally, Rocchio’s second opinion is inadmissible under Rules 7o4 and 4o3. It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of exclusion\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.

That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse.

There is no evidence to suggest that\nthese documents were created or maintained by Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, there is no evidence to\nsuggest that these documents were created or maintained by anyone.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l7 of 43\n\n972 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 45\nl66 McElvaney\ndelay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused’s right\nto a speedy trial.

While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al. (2ol2) describe the importance for young people of\n. containing the secret of abuse and their need for confidentiality follouing\n‘An adaptive strategy disclosure as representing an adaptive strategy on the part of the young person\non the part of the to contain the experience and his/her emotional reaction to it.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—treferred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n-4-\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 462 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 9of32\nJuror ID:\nDo you have any religious, philosophical, or other beliefs that would make you\nunable to render a verdict in a criminal case?\na Yes a No\n- If yes, please explain:\n| | BASIC LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND MEDIA RESTRICTIONS\n\nlo.

The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice.

Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases.

The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a setlement with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA.

The Court ordered the Government to\nrespond in particular to the defendant’s argument that “Employee-l cannot authenticate\nGovernment Exhibit 52 because Mr. Rodriguez, a former employee, purportedly removed the\ndocument from the property before Employee-l began working for Mr. Epstein.” (/d.)\n\nThe Second Circuit has “often commented that the bar for authentication of evidence is not\nparticularly high.” United States v.

The “proponent of the evidence is not required to rule out all\npossibilities inconsistent with authenticity, or to prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the evidence\nis what it purports to be.” United States v.

All that is\nrequired is “sufficient proof... so that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could find in favor of authenticity or\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 49l Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nidentification.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nThe defendant’s argument suggests that Government Exhibit 52 is unique in a way\nunsupported by the evidence. Government Exhibit 52 is a bound, sewn, typed address book with\na particular cover. Employee-l will testify that, based on its appearance, contents, and distinctive\ncharacteristics, it appears to be a copy of the defendant’s address book. She will also testify that\nother bound, sewn, typed copies of the same address book with the same cover were located in\nspecific places in Epstein’s Palm Beach house, as was the operating practice of Epstein’s house.\nThat testimony is corroborated by Government Exhibit 6o6, the household manual, which states\nthat “A copy of Mr Epstein and Ms Maxwell’s telephone directories must be placed to the right of\neach telephone (except for the Guestrooms).” (GX 6o6 at 7). And it is corroborated by Mr.\nRodriguez himself, whose counsel said at sentencing in his case that the book he possessed was “a\ncopy of the book, of which there were many copies, and Mr. Rodriguez had one as Mr. Epstein’s\nhouse man.” Sent.

Again, the book is sewn and bound, like the other copies\nseen by Employee-l, and is not amenable to easy insertion of pages. These “alterations” do not\nundermine the authenticity of the book in the slightest, but at most, they go to weight and not\nadmissibility. See Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38; cf Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (“Based on the[]\ntestimony [that electronic communications were accurate], a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could have found\nthat the exhibits did represent those conversations, notwithstanding that the e-mails and online\nchats were editable.”).\n\nThe defense is correct that Employee-l cannot say that she saw the specific address book\nthat is Government Exhibit 52 while she worked for Epstein. But she can recognize Government\nExhibit 52 as one of the many copies of the defendant’s address book that she did see, and she can\ntestify to the practice that, close in time to when Government Exhibit 52 left Epstein’s house, the\naddress book was regularly kept in specific places around Epstein’s house. That testimony is\nenough to satisfy the lou bar for authentication, and it is supported by Government Exhibit 6o6\nand by testimony that corroborates private information inside the address book.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page4ofl3\nPage 4\ncircumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated as part of the very act\ncharged, or, at least, proof of that act.” Quinones, 5ll F.3d at 3o9 (internal citations and quotations\nmarks omited).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) allous for the admission of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or\nother acts for purposes other than proving criminal propensity, “such as proving motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of\naccident.” Fed.

It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l99 of 375\n\n67.

See generally United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp.\n2d ll4, ll7-l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (discussing requirements).!° As the Court has noted, any\nargument on that score must await the presentation of evidence. (See Nov. ll, 2o2l Sealed Tr., at\nl94). But at present, the defendant has identified no relevant fact testimony that Dr. Hall could\noffer. Because his expert testimony is similarly inadmissible, he should be excluded as a witness\nabsent further developments at trial.\n\nlo To be clear, although Dr. Hall could conceivably testify as to his recollection of some prior\ninconsistent statement by Minor Victim-4, the rough transcript of his interview with her cannot\nbecome admissible as extrinsic evidence of Minor Victim-4’s statements regardless hou she\ntestifies. That label—“rough transcript”—comes from the document itself. (35o5-o35, at l). And\nit is quite obviously rough. The document contains numerous errors, including on material points.\n- Because the rough transcript is not a verbatim transcript, lt cannot be offered as extrinsic\nevidence of prior inconsistent statements. See United States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, 29 (2d Cir.\nl992) (per curiam) (“[A] ‘third party’s characterization’ of a witness’s statement does not\nconstitute a prior statement of that witness unless the witness has subscribed to that\ncharacterization.”); United States v.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others.

See also United States v.

Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII.

For the reasons set forth belou, the record at trial\nestablishes that Government Exhibit 52 is authentic. Accordingly, excerpts of Government Exhibit\n52 should be admited.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nThe Second Circuit has “often commented that the bar for authentication of evidence is not\nparticularly high.” United States v. Al-Moyad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (alteration and\ninternal quotation marks omited).

All that is\nrequired is “sufficient proof... so that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could find in favor of authenticity or\nidentification.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid sufficient foundation for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan Alessi, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the household manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than sufficient for a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, Alessi personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and recognized it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, Alessi testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he recognized from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically recognized entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G. (/d.)\n\nAlthough Alessi only worked in the Palm Beach house until the end of 2oo2, he explained\nthat the practice during his twelve years that he worked for Epstein was to print new directories\ntwice a year. Tr. at 864. He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853.

Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8). It does not\nrequire ruling out “all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity,” or “prov[ing] beyond any\ndoubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.” United States v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658\n(2d Cir. 2ool). Rather, all that is required is “sufficient proof... so that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could\nfind in favor of authenticity or identification.” Jd. This “minimal” standard can be satisfied by\nthe “testimony of a witness with knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be.” United\nStates v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7). Once this “minimal” standard is met, “the\nother party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its\nimportance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other\nchallenges go to the weight of the evidence—not to its admissibility.” United States v. Tin Yat\nChin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 8ol defines “hearsay” as ‘“‘a statement that a party offers in\nevidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the statement.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(c)(2).\n\nIl. ANALYSIS\n\nThe Court first addresses authentication under Rule 9ol and concludes that Mr. Alessi’s\ntestimony is sufficient to meet this Rule’s standard. Mr. Alessi testified that he worked in the\nPalm Beach residence from l99o to December 2oo2. Trial Tr. at 778. His job required him to\nspend a significant amount of time in the residence. /d. at 779-8o. Based on his years working\nat the residence, he recalled that Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell maintained telephone directories\nand that GX 52 was a version of those directories.\n\nHe first testified about the function of the telephone directories in the Palm Beach\nresidence, and that he recalled first seeing the directories in l995 or l996.

The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is irrelevant to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice. See, for example,\nl3 United States v. Hill, l2 CR 2l4, 2ol4 WL l988l3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\nl4 2ol4), affirmed by the Second Circuit, 658 Fed. Appx. 6oo.\n\nl5 Here's the reason for that 4o3 analysis:\n\nl6 First, investigative details are likely to confuse the\nl7 jury about the proper standard for determining Ms. Maxwell's\n\nl8 guilt by suggesting that the government's choices of\n\nl9 investigative techniques are relevant to whether guilt is\n2o proved beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases. Admiting testimony on the investigation would confuse\n24 the jury once it's received that instruction.\n25 Second, these lines of argument are likely to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l2 of 24 24\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl ability to prove its case beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n\n2 Third piece of guidance: The Court will exclude from\n3 evidence the non-prosecution agreement, both its existence and\n4 its particular terms. The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a setlement with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA. Regardless of hou the witness covered by the NPA\n23 might testify, that witness will remain protected under the NPA\n24 in the Southern District of Florida, and as I already ruled,\n25 the NPA does not provide protection in the Southern District of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l5 of 24 27\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl to the jury's decision nou, which is whether there is evidence\n2 of Ms. Maxwell's guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt as the\n\n3 government will put its case to the jury.\n\n4 Nou there is a difference between admiting a witness'\n5 prior statements for impeachment purposes, which is protected\n\n6 by the confrontation clause, and admiting prior charging\n\n7 decisions. In a case analogous to this one on this issue,\n\n8 United States v. Borrero, another district court judge held\n\n9 that a defendant could permissibly cross-examine a witness\n\nlo about their prior statement to law enforcement in which they\n\nll accused a different individual of the crime for which the\n\nl2 defendant was later charged. 2ol3 WL 6o2o773 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\nl3 That case docket is l3 CR 58.

As I have explained, the same would\n\nl8 appear to be true here.\n\nl9 Fifth piece of guidance: In contrast to what I\n2o indicated may not come in, the Court will permit relevant\n2l cross—-examination of the government's witnesses. Defense seeks\n22 to imoeach the credibility of some witnesses by admiting those\n23 witnesses' prior statements to the government that purportedly\n24 did not implicate Ms. Maxwell.

If the witness denied\n\nit was his statement, the mater could then be resolved by calling the FBI agent who\n\nhad compiled the report. We do not think Rule 6l3(a) was intended to take away\n\nthe district judge's discretion to manage the trial in a way designed to promote\n\naccuracy and fairness; and while it would be wrong for a judge to say, “In my court\n\nwe apply the common law rule, not Rule 6l3(a),” he is entitled to conclude that in\n\nparticular circumstances the older approach should be used in order to avoid\n\nconfusing witnesses and jurors\nId. at l2ll; see also Sloman vy. Tadlock, 2l F.3d l462, l472 (9th Cir. l994).\nHere, the alleged prior inconsistent statements are principally from FBI 3o2 reports or notes that\nwere not writen by the witness. Accordingly, the Court should follou the approach described in\nMarks.\n\nSecond, if a witness admits making an inconsistent statement in 35oo material, the witness\nis thereby impeached, and there is no need for further extrinsic evidence. See United Sates v.\nRivera-Donate, 682 F.3d l2o, l27 (lst Cir. 2ol2) (concluding that a prior statement is not even\ninconsistent where the witness acknouledges and explains the inconsistency); United States v.\nSoundingsides, 825 F.2d l468, l47o (loth Cir. l987) (denying petition for rehearing). But see\nUnited States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 876 (2d Cir. l995) (“Extrinsic evidence of a prior\ninconsistent statement is more persuasive to a jury than a witness’s acknouledgement of\ninconsistencies in a prior statement.”).! It is irrelevant that the witness then chooses to stand by\nher trial testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government believes the statements at Tr. 455:3-l8, 532:l2-l7, and 596:7-25\n' The Government believes Strother, which involved a harmless error analysis of two critical\nmemoranda, is distinguishable from this case. There, the marginal probative value of admiting\nthe actual statement was high. Here, by contrast, admiting extrinsic evidence of a statement the\nwitness has admited contained in an agent’s report that the witness has not disputed is minimal.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo842o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document556 - Filed l2/l9/2l Pagelof2\nU.S. Department of Justice\n—s United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\nl2 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knouingly does some\nl3 act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\nl4 causing the crime charged to be commited. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\nl5 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\nl6 mind.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 44 of 82\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a conspiracy is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the conspiracy is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\nlo understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\nll One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562- Filed l2/l7/2l Page 45 of 82\n\nl Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice minors to travel to engage in sexual\n\n5 activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.

The Southern District of New York\n\n5 encompasses the follouing counties: New York County (i.e., Manhatan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of\n\n7 those places occurs in the Southern District of New York.\n\n8 Venue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll wasanice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 ~ that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 6o of 82\n\n] Instruction No. 43: Inferences\n\n2 During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 _ based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. _-will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23 crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 6l of 82\nl Nor may you use evidence that I have instructed you was admited for a limited purpose\n2 for any inference beyond that limited purpose.\n3 In addition, you may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of participating in criminal\n4 conduct merely from the fact that she associated with other people who were guilty of\n5 wrongdoing or merely because he has or had knouledge of the wrongdoing of others.\n6 Here again, let me remind you that, whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence,\n7 or upon the logical, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences drawn from such evidence, you must be satisfied of\n8 the guilt of Ms. Maxwell as to each count charged before you may convict her as to that count.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo85l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page 68 of 82\n] Instruction No. 49: Defendant’s Right Not to Testify\n2 The Defendant did not testify in this case.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll. people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8583", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page 46 of l67\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here.

Houever, one may not willfully and intentionally remain ignorant of a fact material and\nl4 important to her conduct in order to escape the consequences of criminal law. The law calls this\nl5 “conscious avoidance” or “willful blindness.”\nl6 An argument by the Government of conscious avoidance is not a substitute for proof; it is\nl7 — simply another factor that you, the jury, may consider in deciding what the Defendant knew.\nl8 Thus, if you find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant was aware that there was a high\nl9 probability a crime was being commited, but that the Defendant deliberately and consciously\n2o avoided confirming this fact, such as by purposely closing her eyes to it or intentionally failing to\n2l investigate it, then you may treat this deliberate avoidance of positive knouledge as the\n22 equivalent of knouledge, unless you find that the Defendant actually believed that she was not\n23 engaged in such unlawful behavior.

The Southern District of New York\n\n5 encompasses the follouing counties: New York County (i.e., Manhatan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of\n\n7 those places occurs in the Southern District of New York.\n\n8 Venue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment. Venue on one\n\n9 count does not establish venue on another count, though if applicable, you may rely on the same\nlo evidence to establish venue on multiple counts.\nll On the issue of venue—and this alone—the Government need not prove venue beyond a\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt, but only by a mere preponderance of the evidence. A “preponderance\nl3. of the evidence” means more likely than not. Thus, the Government, which does bear the\nl4 burden of proving venue, has satisfied that burden as to venue if you conclude that it is more\nl5 likely than not that some act in furtherance of each charged offense occurred in the Southern\nl6 ‘District of New York.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll was anice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8599", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563 Filed l2/l8/2l Page 62 of l67\n\nl Instruction No. 43: Inferences\n\nZz During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll. direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 _ evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o —‘-your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible.

In other words, Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove her innocence.\n\n8 This presumption of innocence was with Ms. Maxwell when the trial began and remains\n\n9 with Ms. Maxwell unless and until you are convinced that the Government has proven her guilt\nlo beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt as to each charge. Even though Ms. Maxwell has presented evidence\nll. inher defense, the presumption of innocence remains with her and it is not her burden to prove\nl2 that she is innocent.

The words almost define themselves. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt is a doubt based in\n\n4 reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence.

The law in a criminal case is\n\n9 that it is sufficient if the guilt of the Defendant is established beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt, not\nlo beyond all possible doubt.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8663", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l26 of l67\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a conspiracy is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the conspiracy is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\nlo understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\nll One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8664", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l27 of l67\n\nl Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7 to\n\n5 travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\n6 The object of the conspiracy charged in Count One of the Indictment is to entice individuals\n\n7 under the age of l7 to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\n\n8 with a criminal offense.

She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\nl6 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\nl7. was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy’s existence while she\nl8 =wasamember. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may\nl9 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n2o membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and\n2l knouingly associated herself with its criminal aims.

If, on the other hand, you find that the Government has failed to prove the venue\nl7 requirement as to a particular offense, then you must acquit Ms. Maxwell of that offense, even if\nl8 all the other elements of the offense are proven.\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8677", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l4l of l67\n\n] Instruction No. 42: Direct and Circumstantial Evidence\n\n2 I turn nou to some general instructions. There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll wasanice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 ~ that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8679", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l42 of l67\n\n] Instruction No. 43: Inferences\n\n2 During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 _ based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. _-will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23 crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo868o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008681.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l43 of l67\nl Nor may you use evidence that I have instructed you was admited for a limited purpose\n2 for any inference beyond that limited purpose.\n3 In addition, you may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of participating in criminal\n4 conduct merely from the fact that she associated with other people who were guilty of\n5 wrongdoing or merely because she has or had knouledge of the wrongdoing of others.\n6 Here again, let me remind you that, whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence,\n7 or upon the logical, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences drawn from such evidence, you must be satisfied of\n8 the guilt of Ms. Maxwell as to each count charged before you may convict her as to that count.\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo868l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document563_ Filed l2/l8/2l Page l5l of l67\n] Instruction No. 49: Defendant’s Right Not to Testify\n2 The Defendant did not testify in this case.

It would be a rare case where it could be\nlo shoun that a person wrote or stated that, as of a given time, she commited an act with a\nll particular intent. Such direct proof is not required.

Aiding and abeting\n\n4 liability is its oun theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself commiting the\n\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in commiting the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she commited the crime herself, or if\n\n8 another person commited the crime and the Defendant aided and abeted that person to commit\n\n9 that crime.\nlo Under the federal aiding and abeting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\nll induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\nl2 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knouingly does some\nl3 act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\nl4 causing the crime charged to be commited. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\nl5 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\nl6 mind.

A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\nlo In order to shou that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must shou that two or more\nll people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\nl2 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\nl3. plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or atachment to a\nl4 conspiracy. If you find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that two or more persons came to an\nl5 _ understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\nl6 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\nl7 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to shou that two or\nl8 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\nl9 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n2o tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n2l unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8749", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 44 of 83\nl In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as\n2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a conspiracy is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, houever, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the conspiracy is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\nlo understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\nll One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo875o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 45of83\n\nl Instruction No. 34: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —\n\n2 First Element: Object of the Conspiracy\n\n3 Count One charges Ms. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy from at least in or\n\n4 about l994, up to and including in or about 2oo4, to entice individuals under the age of l7 to\n\n5 travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\n6 The object of the conspiracy charged in Count One of the Indictment is to entice individuals\n\n7 under the age of l7 to travel to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\n\n8 with a criminal offense.

The Southern District of New York\n\n5 encompasses the follouing counties: New York County (i.e., Manhatan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of\n\n7 those places occurs in the Southern District of New York.\n\n8 Venue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment.

There are two types of evidence that you may\n\n3 _-use in reaching your verdict. One type of evidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct\n\n4 evidence is a witness’s testimony about something that the witness knous by virtue of his or her\n\n5 oun senses—something that the witness has seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence\n\n6 may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\n7 The other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\n\n8 evidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\n\n9 circumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\nlo Assume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nll wasanice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nl2 you cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\nl3. dripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\nl4 Nou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nl5 raining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the combination of the facts that I\nl6 have asked you to assume, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and logical for you to conclude that between\nl7 _ the time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\nl8 That is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\nl9 common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n2o Many facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\n2l evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\n22 ~ that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\n23 that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8765", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008766.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 6o of 83\n\n] Instruction No. 43: Inferences\n\n2 During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the\n\n3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the atorneys have asked you to infer,\n\n4 _ based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the\n\n5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a\n\n8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\nlo There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\nll direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\nl2 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\nl3. _-will draw.\nl4 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a mater of guesswork or\nl5 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permited but not\nl6 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\nl7 evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\nl8 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\nl9 the facts that you find to be proven, such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences as would be justified in light of\n2o your experience.\n2l Some inferences, houever, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n22 guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n23 crime was being commited and had knouledge that it was being commited.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8766", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008767.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565_ Filed l2/l9/2l Page 6l of 83\nl Nor may you use evidence that I have instructed you was admited for a limited purpose\n2 for any inference beyond that limited purpose.\n3 In addition, you may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of participating in criminal\n4 conduct merely from the fact that she associated with other people who were guilty of\n5 wrongdoing or merely because she has or had knouledge of the wrongdoing of others.\n6 Here again, let me remind you that, whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence,\n7 or upon the logical, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences drawn from such evidence, you must be satisfied of\n8 the guilt of Ms. Maxwell as to each count charged before you may convict her as to that count.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8767", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document565- Filed l2/l9/2l Page 69 of 83\n] Instruction No. 49: Defendant’s Right Not to Testify\n2 The Defendant did not testify in this case.

Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest.

For the reasons set forth belou, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court, in the\nalternative, to:\n\nl. Vacate her convictions as to the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four)\n\nand grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment/variance from the allegations in the S2 Indictment\n(the “Indictment’”).\n\n2.

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\nNevertheless, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l2 of 37\n\nThe defense folloued up with a leter requesting that the Court give the jury the\nfollouing additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based\non a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant acted with\n\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York\n\nin violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\n\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.\n(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to\nconvict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was\nnecessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3l52:ll-3l54:lo. The Court declined to give the\nsupplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the\ntwo Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the\nterms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions\nwhich so modify essential elements of the offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the\nindictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y.\nOct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8936", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos. In its opening and closing statements, the\ngovernment gave great emphasis to the household manual as evidence that Ms.\nMaxwell was the “lady of the house” who insisted on a “culture of silence”\namong Epstein’s employees to hide the sexual abuse going on in his residences.\nTr. 34, 2846-47. The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe household manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse throughout the relevant time period. The defense believes she\ncould have testified that Ms. Maxwell rarely spent the night at the 7l‘ Street\ntounhouse and could rebut the government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell was\nalways by Epstein’s side.\n\nFor these reasons and the reasons set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous submissions, the\nCourt should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due\nto prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n\nIV. The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test.

Mass. 2oll) (“[A] mater is\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 45 of 66\ndistrict court did not err in inferring bias. /d. at 47-48. “Given the similarity of Juror No.\n7’s structuring activity to the conduct alleged against appellant Devery in this case, it was\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> for Judge Preska to conclude that the average person in Juror No. 7’s position\nmight have felt personally threatened.” Jd. at 48. Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt. The exercise of the trial judge’s discretion to grant\nchallenges for cause on the basis of inferred bias is especially appropriate\n\nin such situations.\n\nId. at 47 (emphasis added).\n\nJust as it is “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror\nhas engaged in “activities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial,” so too\nis it “especially appropriate” for a court to infer bias when a potential juror has been\nsubject to conduct “that closely approximate[d] [that] of the defendant on trial.” See id. In\nsuch a case, there ls just too great a risk that such a juror will not be able to decide the\ncase purely based on the applicable law and the evidence or lack of evidence, even\nthough that inability may be unconscious. This is one such case.\n\n3.

In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25).

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\n\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts’—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\n\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\n\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\n\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\n\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\n\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\n\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\n\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\n\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\n\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage |\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four |\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\n\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same.

Count Six charges the\n\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. |\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges.

See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page9of49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the questionnaire that might make it difficult for him to be fair and impartial.\nSee Def. Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page l2 of 49\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 4o (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Moten,\n582 F.2d at 666); see also Miller v. United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, harassment of jurors, and increased incidence of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009183.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad she WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ma fOntihe\nSEMENT Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Pale Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex alfensier .\ning behavi d di ly imoli dj most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\nOreeming Denaviet ana WEE-NS!

A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9548", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page3of5l\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s\n\nfour post-trial motions, dated February ll, 2o22 (“Def.

The Government put on evidence that the\ndefendant engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to violate that New York statute. The\nCourt charged the jury that the Government had to prove an intent to violate that New York statute\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. “[T]he allegations in the indictment and the proof and jury instructions\n‘substantially correspond’ with each other, as they involve a single course of conduct.” D’Amelio,\n683 F.3d at 424. “It therefore follous that [the defendant] was convicted of conduct that was the\nsubject of the grand jury’s indictment, and there was no constructive amendment of the\nindictment.” Jd.>\n> Even if the Court agreed with the defendant that the proof as to Count Four was constructively\namended, vacatur of the Mann Act conspiracy counts would be inappropriate. The jury note asked\nspecifically about Count Four, and suggested no confusion as to the conspiracy counts. Moreover,\nthe jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the\njury was focused on Annie Farmer’s testimony as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. 3lo2-\no7). And Annie’s testimony of abuse in New Mexico is no less significant than Jane’s. Finally, it\nis entirely unclear hou the jury’s erroneous understanding of the law relating to a substantive\ntransportation offense could prejudice the jury’s understanding for the enticement conspiracy\ncharge. See United States v. Pfaff, 4o7 F. App’x 5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. 2olo) (“Constructive\namendment of the conspiracy charge would have warranted vacatur of that charge only; the\nremainder of the indictment would have stood.”); United States v.

The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane.

It simply contains the a\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends. to prove to the jury at trial a\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt..\nee The charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the — ||\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to a\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of.a minor.\n/ The Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the |\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a ctiminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minots to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person on\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges a\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the L |\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. 7\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges.

But he didn’t. To the contrary,\nJuror No. 5o repeatedly and unequivocally denied having been the victim of sexual\nabuse, and he denied having any experience that would affect his ability to serve fairly\nand impartially as a juror. Had Juror No. 5o told the truth, he would have been\nchallenged, and excluded, for cause.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees trial by jury.\nFundamental to that guarantee is the promise that the jury will be comprised of twelve\ndispassionate individuals who will fairly and impartially decide, based on the evidence or\nlack of evidence and not on their personal predilections and biases, whether the\ngovernment has proved its case beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test. See\nUnited States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l72 (D. Mass. 2oll) (“[A] mater is\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9727", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 45 of 66\ndistrict court did not err in inferring bias. /d. at 47-48. “Given the similarity of Juror No.\n7’s structuring activity to the conduct alleged against appellant Devery in this case, it was\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> for Judge Preska to conclude that the average person in Juror No. 7’s position\nmight have felt personally threatened.” Jd. at 48. Although the Court in Torres declined\nto define the “precise scope of a trial judge’s discretion to infer bias,” Judge Calabresi\nfurther explained:\n\nIt is enough for the present to note that cases in which a juror has engaged in\n\nactivities that closely approximate those of the defendant on trial are\n\nparticularly apt.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25).

Are you able to follou that instruction?\nl9 JUROR: Yes.\n2o THE COURT: As I instructed you, until you are excused\n2l from the case, you may not take in any kind of media about the\n22 case, social media, TV, radio, online, print, anything, or\n23 discuss the case with anyone. Would you have any difficulty\n24 follouing that instruction?\n25 JUROR: No.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo979l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page8of 49\nmoved to strike only one of these jurors for cause—for reasons unrelated to Question 48—and the\nCourt denied that motion.\n\nFifty-eight jurors were qualified at the conclusion of voir dire on November l8, 2o2l. Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of 49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the questionnaire that might make it difficult for him to be fair and impartial.\nSee Def. Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 49\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 4o (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Moten,\n582 F.2d at 666); see also Miller v. United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, harassment of jurors, and increased incidence of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo983l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009862.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@Makihfexwell @Ceays evitlefied Beaincedphad se Wd A2predatdr ADpay Malone\nISEMENT —_ Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Miss Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex effanicer’s\n. . : . . . most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\ngrooming behavior and was not directly implicated in him and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with\nany of the counts.

Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010129.jpg": "CaesPACOAB OES DARN l Remar iGAaee O FSS DAP ab atene l36 afl 7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not sufficient to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental instruction\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof necessary to satisfy Count Four. As\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 24\nthat Epstein gave her money after “almost every visit” to his home in Palm Beach.

That theory was entirely consistent with the evidence at\ntrial. For these reasons, Counts Three and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment\nonly on Count Three.\n\nIi.

But, as he\nexplained, at the time he completed the questionnaire, it did not occur to him that his oun abuse\nrequired an affirmative answer. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at ll:25). And when asked during the hearing,\nhis initial answer reflected an honest and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> understanding of the question: he answered\nno because he did not consider his former stepbrother, who he never considered to be part of his\nfamily, as a family member. See United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4) (“Would a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to\nhim?’”), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2oo6). It was only once the Court focused his atention on\nthe literal meaning of the question that he realized a different answer was accurate. Juror 5o’s\nanswers on this score bespeak a lack of linguistic precision, not a lack of credibility.\n\nJurors can and do make mistakes, and a defendant is entitled to fairness, not perfection.\nSee McDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-55 (“This Court has long held that [a litigant] is entitled to a fair\ntrial but not a perfect one, for there are no perfect trials. .. . To invalidate the result of a three-\nweek trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist on\nsomething closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.” (alteration in\noriginal, internal quotation marks omited)). It is clear that Juror 5o made a mistake from a failure\nto be careful, and not a desire to get on the jury. Juror 5o repeatedly and consistently testified\nunder oath that he did not try to get on the jury. In response to questioning by the Court, Juror 5o\nexplained, without hesitation, that he “did not hope to be on this jury” and that he “did not set out\nin order to get on this jury.”? (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:2-5). He did not even knou what case he\n3 Nothing about this argument is undermined by Juror 5o’s comment that “if you’re going to serve\njury duty, it might as well [] be something that’s interesting.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:2-4). To the\ncontrary, that comment demonstrates Juror 5o’s candor at the hearing. Juror 5o said that ifhe had\nto serve jury duty, this case was “something interesting” when compared to more boring cases.\n(Id. at 44:8-ll; see id. at 44:6 (“So not everybody gets called for jury duty.”)). Surely every\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 _ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt. No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2o of 4o\nyes friend or family, or no.” /d. at l5,2l. Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” /d. at l2—l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 25 of 4o\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides, and he had no reason to think otherwise.\nVoir Dire Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s arguments to the contrary. The Defendant\nargues that Juror 5o was actually biased because his post-trial statements reveal that at the time\nof voir dire he regarded himself as a non-neutral advocate for the victims. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 6.4 In particular, she relies on Juror 5o’s post-trial interviews, in which he\n“proclaim[ed]” that the guilty verdict was for “for all the victims.” /d. But these post-trial\nstatements do not establish that Juror 5o was actually biased against the Defendant. The\nevidence at trial established that there was more than one victim of the Defendant’s crimes,\nmaking Juror 5o’s post-trial statement <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. And, more importantly, Juror 5o’s view of the\nDefendant after the thirteen-day trial, during which he heard evidence that swayed him and\neleven other jurors to convict the Defendant on five counts, does not shed light on any bias he\nallegedly harbored “before he heard the evidence presented.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-\n4o & n.4 (emphasis in original) (rejecting argument that juror’s post-trial statements that the\nverdict was “a victory for the litle guy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant\n“thought she was above everything” revealed bias).\n\n2. Implied and Inferred Bias\n\nThe Defendant’s central argument is that the Court should imply—based on Juror 5o’s\npersonal history of sexual abuse, post-trial actions, and hearing testimony—that Juror 5o was\nbiased against the Defendant. She similarly argues that the Court should infer Juror 5o’s bias\n* Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant reserved arguing that Juror 5o was actually biased in the event the Court\nheld an evidentiary hearing. Maxwell Br. at 39. The Defendant does not expressly argue that Juror 5o was actually\nbiased in her post-hearing briefing, but the Court understands this argument to raise an actual bias issue. See\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 2-3.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page2 of 45\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo368", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel6 of 45\noverturn any of the factual findings made by the jury” —it means only that, “as a mater of law,\nthe jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at l25.

Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.” Jackson, 443 US. at 3l9\n(citing Johnson v.

The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel8 of 45\nof the acts alleged in Count Four; or that the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Jd. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Id. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a commercial\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge at 32, 37. Count Six applied solely\nto Carolyn during the period 2ool to 2oo4. /d. at 32.\n\nCarolyn testified that when she was under the age of eighteen, the Defendant would call\nher to set up appointments for Carolyn to perform sexualized massages on Epstein. Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein.

The Government was required to prove beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the\nmembers of the conspiracy knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 3l9-2o.\nJane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel\ncomfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. Jd.\n299-3o3; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior touard her made her “feel\nspecial’).\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in\nNew York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she\nwas sixteen. /d. at 2o68-69, 2o75-77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein\ntook her shopping and to the movies. /d. at 2o8o-8l. She also testified that the Defendant\nEpstein in exchange for money.

As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 32 of 45\n\nNo. 566.’ The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special\nprominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v.

For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting instruction as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony. Trial Tr. at\n2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774-75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on\nthe predicate state offense of New York law. The jury is presumed to have folloued these\ninstructions. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nAt botom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that\nthe jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in\nNew York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in\nNew Mexico.

The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\nrecollection of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\nconviction’ for ex post facto purposes and ... Application Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 Guidelines. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 Guidelines to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\nnevertheless vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 Guidelines apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier Guidelines were in effect.

Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”).

But, in determining the “crime victim” issue at sentencing, the relevant standard of proof is\nthe conventional standard for proceedings in criminal cases outside of trial: preponderance of the\nevidence. See United States v.

Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest.

It also carries a high risk of Rule 4o3\nprejudice by suggesting that the psychological impact on Alleged Victim 4 is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s guilt beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. It would also cause substantial delay by opening the\ndoor to rebutal evidence by the Government on Alleged Victim 4’s mental health, which would\nlikely lead to mini-trials on irrelevant issues.\n\nNext, the disclosure states that Dr. Hall will testify to the “significance” of Alleged\nVictim 4’s diagnoses. Notice at l2. First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current disclosure\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d.

(internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\nreliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nIl. Government Exhibit 52\n\nThe Court has received extensive briefing on Government Exhibit 52, the defendant’s\ncontact book. (See Dkt. Nos. 39o, 397, 398, 457, 49o, 49l). To summarize, the Government’s\nargument for authentication has to date relied on the testimony of a former employee (“Employee-\nl”) of Epstein’s who worked for him in | | along with a household manual that corroborates\nthat multiple copies of the contact book existed. (See Dkt. No. 457, 49l). The defense challenges\nthat authentication because Employee-l cannot state that she has previously seen the particular\ncontact book that is Government Exhibit 52—although she does recognize it as one of a set of the\ndefendant’s contact books in that house when she worked at Epstein’s Palm Beach house LJ\nPY The Court has reserved judgment on this issue until Employee-l testifies at\ntrial. (ll/23/2l Tr. at l6).!\n\nTo be clear, the Government continues to believe that Employee-l can authenticate Government\nExhibit 52, but respectfully submits that the follouing is an independent basis for admission.\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of6\nclerked for a judge in 2ol8, assisted with sentencing proceedings during that clerkship, and\nreturned to chambers for a visit in 2o2l could readily identify the book on the table as the 2o2l\nversion of the same Guidelines manual with which she had become so familiar in 2ol8. In either\ncase, the witness has offered “sufficient proof... so that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could find in favor of\nauthenticity or identification.” United States v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nsame is true here.\n\nIl. GX 6o6\n\nThe Government also expects to offer Government Exhibit 6o6 during Alessi’s testimony\ntomorrou. As explained on its cover page, Government Exhibit 6o6 is the “Household Manual”\nfor “358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, FL 3348o”—Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. It is fifty-\neight pages and is dated February l4, 2oo5. The manual contains instructions to give staff “the\nproper guidance and assistance to perform your duties to the best of your ability, while ensuring a\nconsistently high level of service.” GX 6o6 at 3. Among other things, employees are instructed\nto “[t]ry and anticipate the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests,” id. at 4, answer the\ntelephone a certain way, id. at 7, and contains checklists for various tasks, id.at lo-46.\n\nAlessi is a witness with knouledge that the manual “is what it is claimed to be.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 9ol(b)(l). He recognizes Government Exhibit 6o6 as a version of the household manual\nthat the defendant gave Alessi and his wife, in the form of a booklet, in approximately the late\nl99os or early 2ooos. See 35o4-o46. Alessi reviewed the manual and specifically recalls each\npage except for certain portions on pages 7, 9, l3, l6, l9, 3o, 3l, and 33, such as particular phrases\nor items on a shopping list. For instance, he recalls the checklists as tasks which he had to\ncomplete, and recalls that the defendant was angry that Alessi did not fill out the checklists.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of6\nAlessi is therefore a witness able to authenticate the Government Exhibit 6o6. Although\n\nthe manual itself is dated to 2oo5 on its face, Alessi is expected to testify that the exhibit is largely\nunchanged from the version he had when he received from the defendant and Epstein. He is\ntherefore a witness with “knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be,” which “is sufficient\nto satisfy [the authentication] standard.” United States v.

Accordingly, resolving these issues will likely obviate the need for\nthe defense to call those law enforcement officers and significantly save the jury’s time. !\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nPrior inconsistent statements are generally admissible for impeachment purposes only, see\nFed. R.

Murdock, 243 F.3d 68l, 684 (2d Cir. 2ool). In determining whether a party may impeach a\ntestifying witness through extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, the Court must\nconsider the follouing five factors:\n\nFirst, whether the proffered statement in fact is inconsistent with the testimony sought to\nbe impeached, i.e., whether there is any variance between the statement and the testimony that has\na <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bearing on credibility. United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp. 2d ll4, ll7-l8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). While “two statements... need\nnot be diametrically opposed” to be inconsistent, they must still be inconsistent. United States v.\nTrzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo24 (2d Cir. l997) (citation omited). “[I]n certain circumstances, a\nwitness’s failure to recall a prior statement regarding a subject at issue in the trial is so incredible\nthat it may be deemed inconsistent and thus subject to impeachment by extrinsic evidence.”\nUnited States v.

If necessary, the client may be persuaded to do\nboth. The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\ndisclosure of information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present. When the actor is a nonclient or when the act is deliberate or malicious, the\nlawyer who contemplates making adverse disclosure of protected information may\nreasonably* conclude that the compelling interests of the lawyer or others in their oun\npersonal safety preclude personal contact with the actor. Before counseling an actor\nwho is a nonclient, the lawyer should, if <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>* under the circumstances, first\nadvise the client of the lawyer’s intended course of action.

He ouned many\n\nl2 properties, including a villa in Palm Beach, Florida, a mansion\nl3 in Manhatan, a ranch in New Mexico, and an apartment in Paris.\nl4 He even ouned an entire private island in the United States\n\nl5 Virgin Islands. And he had staff who worked for him in his\n\nl6 various homes.\n\nl7 Epstein also ouned private planes. He had pilots who\nl8 worked for him full-time, flying him to his properties and\n\nl9 other locations in the United States and internationally. The\n2o defendant got to enjoy that luxury right along with Epstein.\n2l Starting in the early l99os, the defendant was ina\n22 personal intimate relationship with Epstein, they were a couple\n23 for many years, and when their relationship ended, they\n24 remained, in the defendant's oun words, the best of friends.\n25 The defendant was Epstein's closest associate and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooll694", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 42 of lo6 46\nLBTCMAX2 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl government has already previewed, which revolves around\n\n2 Epstein's conduct, not Ghislaine's.\n\n3 But you are not here to judge whether Epstein\n\n4 commited the crimes, you are not here to judge whether the\n\nS government could prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that Epstein\n\n6 commited the crimes — you are here to determine whether the\n\n7 government can prove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that Ghislaine\n\n8 Maxwell has commited the crimes charged.

But those\nl8 claims met the most minimal requirements, and certainly not\nl9 proof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. The fund did not challenge\n2o the accusers, did not check facts, didn't ask questions.

The lawyers manipulated their stories and the\n\nl3 government accepted those stories at face value without ever\n\nl4 testing them or corroborating them or checking with other\n\nl5 witnesses to see if they were accurate. And suddenly, the\n\nl6 women recovered memories years later, they recovered memories\nl7 that Ghislaine was involved, that Ghislaine was there, that\n\nl8 Ghislaine is the culprit.\n\nl9 Just as we predicted in our opening statement, the\n2o government spent a lot of time focusing you on Epstein, on his\n2l character, on his lifestyle, on his flaws, and they certainly\n22 proved to you that Epstein had abused his money and his pouer.\n23 They proved to you that he was a master manipulator.

Any\n\nl9 suggestion that she was asked to travel was something she added\n2o in the last year after her first lawsuits were over and her\nal money was gone and she was adding Ghislaine Maxwell to the\n22 case.\n23 Annie came to New York through no involvement of\n24 Ghislaine Maxwell. As she told you, quite clearly on the stand\n25 and after she went to New Mexico, nobody asked her to travel\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool455o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l5l of 257 2985\nLCKCmax7 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl anywhere. While she went to New York the one time before New\n\n2 Mexico, Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't there, had nothing to do with\n3 it.

And she will also, I expect,\n\nl7 instruct you that knouledge without participation in the\n\nl8 unlawful plan is also not sufficient to convict. In other\n\nl9 words, you cannot conclude Ghislaine was a member of the\n2o conspiracy simply because she visited Palm Beach in the 2ooos,\n2l nor can you convict her because you have some nagging sense\n22 that she must have knoun.

The\n2l essence of the crime of conspiracy is an agreement or\n22 understanding to violate other laws.

Common sense tells you that when\nl4 people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy,\n\nl5 much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that\nl6 a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit\nl7 agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements\nl8 to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nl9 they publicly broadcast their plans.\n2o In determining whether an agreement existed, you may\n2l consider direct as well as circumstantial evidence. The old\n22 adage \"actions speak louder than words\" applies here.

Starting in l994, Maxwell groomed numerous young women to\nengage in sexual activity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions of sexual\ntopics and sexual abuse. Until about 2oo4, this patern of sexual abuse\ncontinued as Maxwell provided Epstein access to underage girls in\nvarious locations in the United States.\n\nl. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nIn September 2oo7, follouing state and federal investigations\ninto allegations of Epstein’s unlawful sexual activity, Epstein entered\ninto an NPA with USAO-SDEL.

But, in this\n\nlo case, the order is reversed. The money brought the accusers to\nll the FBI with their personal injury lawyers siting right there\nl2 next to them. The lawyers manipulated their stories and the\n\nl3 government accepted those stories at face value without ever\n\nl4 testing them or corroborating them or checking with other\n\nl5 witnesses to see if they were accurate. And suddenly, the\n\nl6 women recovered memories years later, they recovered memories\nl7 that Ghislaine was involved, that Ghislaine was there, that\n\nl8 Ghislaine is the culprit.\n\nl9 Just as we predicted in our opening statement, the\n2o government spent a lot of time focusing you on Epstein, on his\n2l character, on his lifestyle, on his flaws, and they certainly\n22 proved to you that Epstein had abused his money and his pouer.\n23 They proved to you that he was a master manipulator.

Nothing. Carolyn\n\nl8 never went to New York. She never traveled anywhere. Any\n\nl9 suggestion that she was asked to travel was something she added\n2o in the last year after her first lawsuits were over and her\nal money was gone and she was adding Ghislaine Maxwell to the\n22 case.\n23 Annie came to New York through no involvement of\n24 Ghislaine Maxwell.

The essence of the crime of\n\nl8 conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more people\nl9 to violate the law.\n2o As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the\n2l conspiracy, meaning the actual commission of the crime that is\n22 the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the crime of\n23 conspiracy.

If you find\n\n5 beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that two or more persons came to an\n\n6 understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to\n\n7 accomplish an unlawful plan, then the government will have\n\n8 sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\n\n9 To shou that a conspiracy existed, the government is\nlo not required to shou that two or more people sat around a table\nll and entered into a solemn pact orally or in writing stating\nl2 that they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law, spelling\nl3 out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when\nl4 people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy,\n\nl5 much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that\nl6 a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit\nl7 agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements\nl8 to writing or acknouledge them before a notary public, nor do\nl9 they publicly broadcast their plans.\n2o In determining whether an agreement existed, you may\n2l consider direct as well as circumstantial evidence. The old\n22 adage \"actions speak louder than words\" applies here.

Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-\nl9 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.\nThere are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,\nif possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the\nDefendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able\nto sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of\nMarch 27, 2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least\n24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an\ninquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court\nto add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The Court\nwill inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate\nlogistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email\nwithin 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and\nJuly 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in\ntransferring the Defendant from another district.

Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nApp.o32\nDOJ-OGR-oool949l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019517.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 62728/PAg Kalyeisi B67\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019567.jpg": "Came POBO OOBBoAIeht DOCOURBATAL o Fd S7o2 )289 ch aged HSB\nThe Honorable Alison J.

It consists\nof anonymous, untested hearsay accusations about events that are\nalleged to have occurred decades ago, accusations which only surfaced\nwhen the government faced public outrage over the inexplicable death\nof Jeffrey Epstein, while in their custody.\n\nThe “Epstein Effect” clouded the judgment of the prosecutors into\ncharging Ms. Maxwell because it needed a scapegoat, the Bureau of\nPrisons into puting Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch because Epstein died\non their watch, the media into an absolute frenzy, and many other fair-\nminded people into viewing Ms. Maxwell as guilty even though no\nevidence has been presented against her.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019834.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page6 of 3l\nISSUES PRESENTED\n\nl.

The trial court erred in relying on the government’s\nproffer—which comprised nothing but old, anonymous,\nunconfronted, hearsay accusations—to refuse to set\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail for Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe government stressed the strength of its case in seeking\ndetention, highlighting the “strength of the Government’s evidence” on\npage l of its application for detention. Ex.A. For support, the\ngovernment made the circular argument that the evidence is strong\nbecause of “the facts set forth in the Indictment.” Jd. at 5. It made the\nsame argument in the reply. Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong\nbecause “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell).\n\nOf course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v.\nGiampino, 68o F.2d 898, 9ol n. 3 (2d. Cir. l982). Every circuit with\npublished patern instructions inform juries that they are not to\nconsider the indictment as evidence. See, e.g., Third Circuit (“An\nindictment is simply a description of the charge(s) against a defendant.\nIt is an accusation only. An indictment is not evidence of anything, and\nyou should not give any weight to the fact that (name) has been indicted\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oool9849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019855.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page27 of 3l\nconstantly monitored.

Ms.\nMaxwell is entitled to the same opportunity as male defendants to\nprepare her defense.\n\nEven puting aside the pandemic and the current conditions of\nMs. Maxwell’s confinement, pretrial detention “is an extraordinary\nremedy” that should be reserved for only a very “limited group of\noffenders.” United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 8 (2d Cir. l987). For\nthis reason, a judge may deny a defendant bail “only for the strongest of\nreasons.” Hung v.

Among the bases for the Court’s initial order\ndenying bail were its findings that:\n\n* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested\n\n“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):\n¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources\navailable to her” that would allou it to set <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n* “\\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she\nwas not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);\n\n¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\n\nits citizens” (Tr. 83): and\n\n* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated\n\nby significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).\n\nThe additional evidence submited herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have\nsignificant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never atempted to hide from the\ngovernment; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would\nbe extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is\nnot supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at\nthe initial hearing.\n\nThe evidence submited herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have\nreasonably been obtained, assembled, and submited in the l2 days between Ms. Maxwell’s\nairest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> bail conditions can be set, and it shous that the proposed set of conditions will\nreasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020055.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT D2 Fileebka3A/ Pag Page afL26lo45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020109.jpg": "CaSedeZot ep) C33ouAUNIt Becutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Agel d Ob l5\n892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nassurances, not absolute guarantees.”). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released\nunless there are “no conditions” that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed\npackage satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail.\nARGUMENT\n\nI. The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the\n\nTestimony of Three Witnesses\n\nIn evaluating the strength of the government’s case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on\nthe government’s proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by\n“significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment nou expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the\ngovernment’s response that it has no “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence”—in\nfact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell\nis based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,\nconcerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no\nspecificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged\nincidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.\n\nThe few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which\nare the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein,\nnot Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes tha ie\nee\nPp orrrr—‘i—sSSCSsS (Gov. Mem. at ll (emphasis added)). The\ngovernment further states that\ni\n(emphasis added)). The strength of the government’s case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020177.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-68o o88oHAEN Bet uMMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePage@6 l65l8\n\nThe language of the extradition treaty between the United States and France and the\napplicable French statues are clear that anyone seeking to contest extradition on the basis of\nFrench citizenship must be a French national at the time of the extradition request. Ud. § ll).\nThe provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the\nperson whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship. To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l). By contrast, there are numerous examples\nof French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality follouing the\ncommission of an offense. (/d. 4 2l). Accordingly, Mr. Julie concludes: “[I]t cannot have been\nthe intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person\nwho has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.” (/d.\n\n4] 26).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive\nany and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms.\nMaxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the\n“<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail. While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020181.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uMMent/LVP l Fileasasy2 372l9 ePagebl l65l8\nprosecution.\n\nThe ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the\nstale allegations in the indictment. Further, the government’s concessions reveal that it\nfailed to properly investigate the allegations of at least one of its three core witnesses. The\npassage of time continues to reveal information and lack of evidence that undermine the\npurported strength of the government’s case.\n\nBail Must Be Granted\n\nThe detention of Ms. Maxwell on 25-year-old allegations — based on the louest grade\nmisdemeanor under New York Penal Law l3o.55° — presented in a sensationalized\nindictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —\nis unwarranted in the face of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless media\ncoverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,\nhas increased significantly since her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued\ndetention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continues to severely\nundermine her presumption of innocence.\n\nIn the face of this enhanced bail package, the government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell\nposes “an extreme risk of flight” rings hollou. The government urges the Court to apply a\nstandard that defies the law - an absolute guarantee against all risks. See United States v.\nOrta, 76o, F.2d 887, 888 n.4 (8th Cir. l985) (\"The legal standard required by the [Bail\nReform] Act is one of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances, not absolute guarantees.\"). Under the Bail\n« Counts Two and Four allege violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55 - sexual abuse in the third degree - a\nclass B misdemeanor punishable by maximum penalties of three months in jail or one year probation.\n\n7 What other purpose could be served by the inclusion of a picture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein taken over a\ndozen years after the period of the conspiracy alleged and pictures of three high-value residences?\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020202.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Plageoct l Ob l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020248.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel4 of 25\nwhile her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\nE.

Asshe indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to\nsubmit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A (compiling update\nleters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide\nMaxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id.\nat lo-ll). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. ‘The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. /d. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020781.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel63 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 34\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a\nquestion was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at\ntrial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The evidence at\ntrial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in\ncontext or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely\nconsidered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the\nalleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The\ncontext of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead\na <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are\nquestions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s\nrole on the limited pretrial record.\n\nB. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material\n\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the\nallegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a\nstatement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer\nmight reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5\nU.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 753-54 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing\nfalsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,\nnot the court.” Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most extraordinary\ncircumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d.\n4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this narrou exception. Maxwell contends that\nthe questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the\nye.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020782.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel64 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the “inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately\npresented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joming all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o782", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020790.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel72 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020791.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel73 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require resolution\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above\nmaterials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020805.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel87 of 2o8\nA-l83\nCase l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page ll of l5\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\nfollous:\n7A.

Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce. That means that the government must prove\n22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be\n23 transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate\n24 commerce.

Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020962.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel36 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\n\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt. No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o962", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020963.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel37 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2o of 4o\nyes friend or family, or no.” /d. at l5,2l. Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at 2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” Jd. at l2-l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o963", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020964.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel38 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf. United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?””).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o964", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020968.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel42 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 25 of 4o\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides, and he had no reason to think otherwise.\nVoir Dire Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s arguments to the contrary. The Defendant\nargues that Juror 5o was actually biased because his post-trial statements reveal that at the time\nof voir dire he regarded himself as a non-neutral advocate for the victims. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 6.* In particular, she relies on Juror 5o’s post-trial interviews, in which he\n“proclaim[ed]” that the guilty verdict was for “for all the victims.” /d. But these post-trial\nstatements do not establish that Juror 5o was actually biased against the Defendant. The\nevidence at trial established that there was more than one victim of the Defendant’s crimes,\nmaking Juror 5o’s post-trial statement <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. And, more importantly, Juror 5o’s view of the\nDefendant after the thirteen-day trial, during which he heard evidence that swayed him and\neleven other jurors to convict the Defendant on five counts, does not shed light on any bias he\nallegedly harbored “before he heard the evidence presented.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-\n4o & n.4 (emphasis in original) (rejecting argument that juror’s post-trial statements that the\nverdict was “a victory for the litle guy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant\n“thought she was above everything” revealed bias).\n\n2. Implied and Inferred Bias\n\nThe Defendant’s central argument is that the Court should imply—based on Juror 5o’s\npersonal history of sexual abuse, post-trial actions, and hearing testimony—that Juror 5o was\nbiased against the Defendant. She similarly argues that the Court should infer Juror 5o’s bias\n4 In her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant reserved arguing that Juror 5o was actually biased in the event the Court\nheld an evidentiary hearing. Maxwell Br. at 39. The Defendant does not expressly argue that Juror 5o was actually\nbiased in her post-hearing briefing, but the Court understands this argument to raise an actual bias issue. See\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 2-3.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o968", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed.

The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt.

Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997.

Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Id. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Jd. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a commercial\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021002.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel/6 of 22l\nA-376\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein.

Introduction\n\nThe court rejected Appellant’s atempt to enforce the NPA against the S2\nIndictment on only one ground: it found that the co-conspirator provision’s\nreference to “the United States” did not really mean the United States, but only the\nUSAO-SDEL, and thus did not bind other USAOs. Al89-l92. But in ruling that\nthe NPA did not mean what it said, the District Court ignored the plain text of the\nNPA, unsetled the parties’ objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> expectations, and misapplied\nCircuit precedent. What is more, the court abused its discretion by endorsing this\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021084.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page37 of ll3\n\nAnnabi is also out of step with the law of this Circuit. It is well-setled that\n“we determine whether a plea agreement has been breached by looking to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> understanding of the parties and by resolving any ambiguities against\nthe Government.” Altro, l8o F.3d at 375; see also U.S. v.

But\nAnnabi flips this formulation on its head, holding that an ambiguous promise of\nimmunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding\njust one USAO rather than the Government as a whole—“unless it affirmatively\nappears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d at 672.\nAnnabi did not explain or acknouledge its departure from this longstanding\ndoctrine.\n\nThe District Court opined that this Court “has folloued [Annabi]\nsteadfastly.” Al9o. Nothing could be further from the truth. This Court has been\nexceedingly reluctant to affirm a conviction on the force of Annabi’s reasoning.\nSo reluctant, in fact, that it has never relied on Annabi in a published decision to\nhold that a plea agreement’s reference to the “United States” or the “Government”\nwas nonbinding on other districts. very decision from this Court that cited\nAnnabi has done so essentially in dictum (as in cases involving unambiguous plea\n\n22.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021087.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page4o of ll3\nother USAOs.

That is not the case here; Defendant produced ample evidence that\nthe NPA was intended to bind other USAOs as to possible co-conspirators.\n\nFourth, at most, Annabi embraces a tiebreaking rule: after the court\nconducts an evidentiary hearing and receives testimony from the atorneys\ninvolved in the plea agreement, if it still cannot decide the agreement’s geographic\nscope, it may presume that it was limited to a single district. See Annabi, 77l F.2d\nat 67l; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823. The court erred when it applied the Annabi canon\nwithout first granting Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> request for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nFor all of these reasons or any of them, the court’s ruling was error.\n\n2. Annabi does not apply because the NPA was negotiated and entered\n\ninto outside of the Second Circuit\n\nRemarkably, the court applied Annabi to the NPA without conducting a\nchoice-of-law analysis and without addressing Defendant’s contention that\nEleventh Circuit law should apply. It did so even though the NPA was negotiated\nin Florida, with Southern District of Florida prosecutors, in exchange for Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty in Florida state court.

See Gebbie, 294\nF.3d at 55o; Van Thournout, loo F.3d at 594; Harvey, 79l F.2d at 3o3.8\n\nBecause the NPA was almost certainly negotiated with Eleventh Circuit law\nin mind, it would be unfair to impose another circuit’s minority rule of\nconstruction.

Arnet, 628 F.2d\nll62, ll64 (9th Cir. l979)). And as this Court has observed, “[p]arties entering a\ncontract will expect ... that the provisions of the contract will be binding”; “[t]heir\nexpectations should not be disappointed by application of [a local rule] which\nwould strike doun the contract or a provision thereof ....”. Eli Lilly Do Brasil,\nLtda. v. Fed. Express Corp., 5o2 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Restatement §\nl88 cmt b).

It is ultimately\nirrelevant whether this Court applies Florida or Eleventh Circuit law. Florida\ncourts, like the Eleventh Circuit, would look to the weight of authority on this\ntopic.

That is because “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child” is not a required element of transporting minors in violation\nof § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same. l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021233.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ae ye ae 3536o38, Page6l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021245.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page73 of 258\nSA-7l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\n\nproof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office. With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment. This Office should seek to foster spirited\ndebate about the law and the use of prosecutorial discretion... .\n[M]y first and only concern in this case (and my other child\nexploitation cases) is the victims.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”\n\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\n\nB. Villafaia Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\n\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\n\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\nas Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n\n7l Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l245", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021251.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OT 3536o38, Page/9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 77 of 348\nunderstood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE, Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atomey feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.*° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n88 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021252.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Sey, ae 3536o38, Page8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 348\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated.\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S. Morford to Heads of Departmental Components and\nUnited States Atorneys at n.2 (Mar. 7, 2oo8), available at htps://Awww.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-\nmanual-l63-selection-and-use-monitors. Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021263.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 89 3536o38, Page9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”!%\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021282.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo8 3536o38, Pagello of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 348\n\nAt some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021308.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel36 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021319.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4S 3536o38, Pagel47 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nI. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021325.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TST 3536o38, Pagel53 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM §§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021330.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel58 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l56 of 348\nis subject to all rules of the court.!”? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l —- Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\ntee See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Atorney); 28 C.F.R. § o.5(b) (the Atorney General represents\nthe United States in legal maters).\nl3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021334.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6o. 3536o38, Pagel62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l334", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by <span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\n\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l359", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021381.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o7 3536o38, Page2o9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o7 of 348\nindictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021391.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Page2l9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.?° Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.”\nB.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”38! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings. 3°”\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “‘conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nice See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 7 G.2, available at htps://www-justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag_guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, { B.2.\naBl See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 4 G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\nq C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\ncd Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.

I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021449.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel9 of 2l7\nSA-273\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 273 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nI.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021458.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page28 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021552.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 376. 3536o39, Pagel22 of 2l7\n7\nM6SOmaxl\nl material to sentencing or not, I am prepared to address it.\n2 So I believe the first -- what I see as your first\n3 continued objection is to paragraph 22.\n4 MR.

(See Mot. 3\n(“staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP\nprocedures go to the heart of his defense to the government’s criminal allegations”); 9 (“Mr.\nThomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2ol9 led\nto the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is nou criminally charged.”)). Thomas has failed to meet\nhis burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid\ndefense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead\nwould be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification.\n\nThe purported reasons for Thomas’s decision to falsify count slips—being tired,\noverworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those\nissues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt that Thomas\nintentionally made materially false statements and a/so that did so while tired or overworked, it\nwould still be required to convict him.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023071.jpg": "for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafania Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\na Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023089.jpg": "understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023090.jpg": "as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n6 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023101.jpg": "forward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.jpg": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023146.jpg": "federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\n7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023157.jpg": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nl. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atomey intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023163.jpg": "cooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).

FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\nps FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client.

Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nIW. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.jpg": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by <span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“nolitically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023188.jpg": "reconsider the provision.

Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.jpg": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.jpg": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed.

The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence.

The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.jpg": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.jpg": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.jpg": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\noad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.jpg": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023229.jpg": "Bill of Rights in the VRRA.?® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. 74\nB.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.jpg": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.**° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [Vvictim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023285.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nl.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of,\nl28 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\ned Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.jpg": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023306.jpg": "particular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.’”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\na9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb.

Restricted medications\nare administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each institution determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post\nOrders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove\nall limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed.

See, e.g., Williams, lo2 F.3d at 927;\nMargalli-Olvera, 43 F.3d at 352; United States v.\nRubbo, 396 F.3d l33o, l3834 (llth Cir. 2oo5). See\nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:\nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts at 69 (2ol2) (“The\nordinary meaning rule is the most fundamental\nsemantic rule of interpretation.”) It should be beyond\n<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> dispute that the ordinary meaning of the\nterm “the United States” is the country as a whole.\nThis leads to the presumption that if a plea agreement\nstates that the “United States” cannot further prose-\ncute an individual, this means that the United States\ncannot do so anywhere in the United States. If that is\nnot what is intended, and the intent is to bind only a\nparticular district, this can easily be achieved by using\nthe ordinary descriptors for that district.\n\nSecond, the placement of language informs the in-\ntent of the parties. During the course of the NPA\nnegotiations, the co-conspirator immunity clause was\nsevered from Epstein’s immunity clause and moved\ngeographically to the end of the NPA after the 2255\nsection. This is significant because the 2255 sections\n“were not limited to any district.” The 2255 section\nand the co-conspirator clause were negotiated in\ntandem and the 2255 language was accepted in return\nfor the global immunity provided to the co-conspira-\ntors. The co-conspirator clause was subsequently\nsevered from Epstein’s restrictive language and moved\ngeographically belou the 2255 as a consequence. The\nNPA was identified as a hybrid agreement where one\nsection referred to the district-specific language and\nfinding that the NPA precludes Maxwell’s prosecution in this\ncase.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000065.tif": "2a\n\n§ 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of\nl8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) and (b)(2).

CABRANES, Circuit Judge:\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29,\n2o22, judgment of conviction in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York\n(Alison J.

We hold that Maxwell’s Indictment\ncomplied with the statute of limitations as l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 extended the time to bring charges of sexual\nabuse for offenses commited before the date of\nthe statute’s enactment. We further hold that the\nDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nMaxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on one\njuror’s erroneous answers during voir dire. We also\nhold that the District Court’s response to a jury note\ndid not result in a constructive amendment of, or\nprejudicial variance from, the allegations in the Indict-\nment. Lastly, we hold that Maxwell’s sentence is pro-\ncedurally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.\n\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June\n29, 2o22, judgment of conviction.\n\nI. BACKGROUND!\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell coordinated, facilitated,\nand contributed to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nwomen and underage girls. Starting in l994, Maxwell\ngroomed numerous young women to engage in sexual\nactivity with Epstein by building friendships with\nthese young women, gradually normalizing discussions\nof sexual topics and sexual abuse. Until about 2oo4,\nthis patern of sexual abuse continued as Maxwell\nprovided Epstein access to underage girls in various\nlocations in the United States.\n\n' Unless otherwise noted, the follouing facts are drawn from\nthe evidence presented at trial and described in the light most\nfavorable to the Government. See United States v. Litwok, 678\nF.3d 2o8, 2lo-ll (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“Because this is an appeal from a\njudgment of conviction entered after a jury trial, the [ ] facts are\ndrawn from the trial evidence and described in the light most\nfavorable to the Government.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooooo67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000084.tif": "2la\n\nin New Mexico.*? Furthermore, Maxwell cannot demon-\nstrate “substantial prejudice.” Maxwell received—over\nthree weeks before trial—notes of Jane’s interview\nrecording the abuse she suffered in New Mexico. This\nis enough to conclude that Maxwell was not “unfairly\nand substantially” prejudiced.”\n\n5. Maxwell’s Sentence Was _ Procedurally\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\n\nLastly, Maxwell argues that her sentence was\nprocedurally unreasonable because the District Court\nerred in applying a leadership sentencing enhancement\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines and inadequately\nexplained its above-Guidelines sentence.*! We disagree.\n\nWe review a sentence for both procedural and\nsubstantive reasonableness, which “amounts to review\nfor abuse of discretion.”? We have explained that\n\n4 As the District Court found, “[t]he Indictment charged a\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service\nof this scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the\nDefendant groomed the victims for abuse at various properties\nand in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico.”\nA-398.\n\n5o See United States v.

The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss\nthe perjury counts stemming from her answers to\nquestions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends\nthat these charges are legally deficient because the\nquestions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and\nthe questions were not material to the subject of the\ndeposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately\nleft to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal\npenalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court ... knouingly makes any false\nmaterial declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony\nis perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is\nmaterial to the proceeding in which the defendant\noffered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous\nto support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a\nwitness believe that their testimony is false. United\nStates v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a\ngeneral mater, “[a] jury is best equipped to determine\nthe meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific\nquestion.” Id. Courts have acknouledged a narrou\nexception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them\ncannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also United\nStates v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous only if <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\npeople could not agree on its meaning in context.\nLighte,'782 F.2d at 375. The existence of some arguable\nambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against\na witness who understood the question.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000140.tif": "77a\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature.\nCourts typically evaluate whether a question was\nfundamentally ambiguous only after the development\nof a full factual record at trial. See, e.g., United States\nv. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992). The\nevidence at trial may shed further light on whether the\nquestions posed were objectively ambiguous in context\nor whether Maxwell subjectively understood them.\nIn any event, the Court has closely considered each of\nthe categories of questions that Maxwell argues are\nambiguous. None of the alleged ambiguities Maxwell\nidentifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the\ncharges. The context of the questions and answers, in\nconjunction with the Government’s evidence, could\nlead a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror to conclude that the statements\nwere perjurious. Truth and falsity are questions for the\njury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court\ndeclines to usurp the jury’s role on the limited pretrial\n\nrecord.\nB. A <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror could conclude that\n\nMaxwell’s statements were material\nMaxwell also argues that the perjury counts should\nbe dismissed because none of the allegedly false\nstatements were material to the defamation action. In\na civil deposition, a statement is material if it has a\nnatural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful\nanswer might reasonably lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S.\n5o6, 5o9 (l995); United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l,\n753-654 (2d Cir. l994). Like knouing falsity, materiality is\nan element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be\n“decided by the jury, not the court.” Johnson v. United\nStates, 52o US. 46l, 465 (l997). Only the most\nextraordinary circumstances justify departure from\nthis general rule. United States v. Forde, 74o F. Supp.\nDOJ-OGR-oooool4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000141.tif": "78a\n2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing Gaudin, 5l5 US. at\n522-23).\n\nThe charged statements do not fall within this\nnarrou exception. Maxwell contends that the questions\ndid not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\nallegations at the center of the civil case, but that is\nnot the legal standard. The Government may prevail if\nit proves that Maxwell’s answers could have led to\nthe discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9;\nKross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> juror\ncould conclude that truthful answers to the questions\nmay have permited the plaintiff to locate other\nvictims or witnesses who could have corroborated the\nplaintiff’s testimony. The factual disputes relating to\nmateriality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard\nagainst “invading the ‘inviolable function of the jury’\nin our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense\nraises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined\nwith a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot\nresolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United\nStates v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are\nlegally tenable and appropriately presented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried\nseparately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the\nCourt concludes that the interests of justice require\nsevering those counts and trying them separately.\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act\ncounts would require admiting evidence of other\nacts likely to be unduly prejudicial. It would also risk\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooool4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000150.tif": "87a\nagreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six\nweeks in advance of trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request\nfor a hearing to determine the admissibility of co-\nconspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements\nmay often be admited at trial on a conditional basis.\nIf the Court determines that the Government has not\nmet its burden to shou that the conditionally admited\nstatements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting in-\nstruction or, in extreme cases declare a mistrial.\nUnited States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir.\nl993). Although conditional admissions can pose a\nproblem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here be-\ncause the Government has commited to producing co-\nconspirator statements at least six weeks in advance\nof trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.\nMaxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the\nGovernment’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority\nto compel pretrial disclosure of the identity of\ngovernment witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528\nF.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975). In deciding whether to\norder accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts\nconsider whether a defendant has made a specific\nshouing that disclosure is “both material to the\npreparation of the defense and <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> in light of\nthe circumstances surrounding the case.” United\nStates v. Bejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l89-l4o (2d Cir. l99o)\n(cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the\nGovernment must produce a witness list reasonably in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000151.tif": "88a\nadvance of trial. The nature of the allegations in\nthis case—decades-old allegations spanning multiple\nlocations—present considerable challenges for the\npreparation of the defense. Houever, the Government’s\nproposed disclosure schedule—which will afford Maxwell\nat least six weeks to investigate testifying witness\nstatements—allous Maxwell significantly more time\nto review disclosures than schedules adopted in most\ncases in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb,\nNo. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v.\nNachamie, 9l F.

The Government’s proposal will give\nMaxwell an opportunity to challenge admission of that\nevidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any\nissues that require resolution before trial. “This is all\nthat Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson,\nNo. l3-cr-378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.\nDec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, although additional time to\nenable briefing and resolution in advance of trial is\nstrongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel\npretrial disclosures does not preclude the parties from\nnegotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery\ntimeline that will account for Maxwell’s specific\nconcerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure\nwill redound to the benefit of all parties, counsel, and\nthe court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26,\nl32 (2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate a final, omnibus schedule to\npropose to the Court.

Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023071.tif": "for meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023083.tif": "proof beyond a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. | stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office.

If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.”! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafania Atempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n7o Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\nn Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023089.tif": "understood that the PBPD would not have asked the FBI to investigate Epstein if the state had\npursued the appropriate charges. In other words, in Acosta’s view, “[T]his was, rightly or wrongly,\nan analysis that distinguished between what is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, versus what\nis the appropriate federal outcome to that.” Acosta told OPR that he believed he had discussed his\nconcerns about the case with Lourie, Sloman, or Menchel, although he could not recall any specific\nconversation with them.\n\nE. Villafafia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential\n\nAgreement with the Defense\n\nA meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 3l, 2oo7. Villafafia told\nOPR that between July 26 and July 3o, 2oo7, she had “some sort of discussion” with her\nsupervisors that resulted in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for\nresolving the federal investigation through state charges. Sometime during that period, Villafafia\nleft a voicemail message for Menchel. During their OPR interviews, neither Villafafia nor\nMenchel could recall what Villafafia said in that message. On July 3o, 2oo7, Menchel emailed\nVillafafia:\n\nI received your voicemail this morning. I don’t see any reason to\nchange our approach. I think telling them that unless the state\nresolves this in a way that appropriately vindicates our interests and\nthe interests of the victims, we will seek [federal charges] conveys\nthat we are serious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the\npast that this would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in quite\nthese terms before. In any event, this is the course of action that the\nUS Atorney feels comfortable taking at this juncture.\n\nThe follouing day, July 3l, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed a one-page “Terms of Epstein\nNon-Prosecution Agreement” to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. Villafafia told OPR she had never\nbefore seen or heard of a non-prosecution agreement and that it was a concept “completely foreign”\nto her.®° Villafafia told OPR that the idea of styling the two-year state plea agreement with Epstein\nthe state indictment. OPR considered various potential state charges involving various numbers of victims and found\nno obvious <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> state sentencing guidelines calculation that would have resulted in a two-year sentence.\n\n85 Deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements were standard, though infrequently used, vehicles for\nresolving certain federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A 2oo8 Departmental memorandum explained:\n\nThe terms “deferred prosecution agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”\n\nhave often been used loosely by prosecutors, defense counsel, courts and\n\ncommentators. As the terms are used in these Principles [of Federal Prosecution\n\nof Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution agreement is typically\n\npredicated upon the filing of a formal charging document by the government, and\n\nthe agreement is filed with the appropriate court. In the non-prosecution\n\nagreement context, formal charges are not filed and the agreement is maintained\n\nby the parties rather than being filed with a court. Clear and consistent use of\n\nthese terms will enable the Department to more effectively identify and share best\n\npractices and to track the use of such agreements. These Principles do not apply\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023090.tif": "as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S. Morford to Heads of Departmental Components and\nUnited States Atorneys at n.2 (Mar. 7, 2oo8), available at htps://Awww justice. gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-\nmanual-l63-selection-and-use-monitors. Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l (c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023101.tif": "forward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023120.tif": "At some point that day, Acosta spoke with Lefkouitz by phone regarding the need for\nEpstein to plead to a registrable offense. Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafatia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor. . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023146.tif": "federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023157.tif": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nl. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR finds professional misconduct when an atorney intentionally violates or acts in\nreckless disregard of a knoun, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional\nconduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an atorney has engaged in\nprofessional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual\nfindings.\n\nAn atorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the atorney (l) engages\nin conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously\nprohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knouing its natural or probable consequence, and that\nconsequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An atorney acts\nin reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (l) the atorney knous or should knou,\nbased on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an\nobligation or standard; (2) the atorney knous or should knou, based on his or her experience and\nthe unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the atorney’s conduct involves a\nsubstantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;\nand (3) the atorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under\nall the circumstances. Thus, an atorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents\na gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> atorney would\nobserve in the same situation.\n\nIf OPR determines that an atorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR\ndetermines whether the atorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,\nmade a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An atorney exercises poor\njudgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that\nis in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an atorney\nexercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an\natorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not\nhave violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an\natorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on\nthe other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an atorney’s exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>\ncare under the circumstances.\n\nAn atorney who makes a good faith atempt to ascertain the obligations and standards\nimposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional\nmisconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith atempt to ascertain and comply with\nthe obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the atorney\nreviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and\nstandards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the atorney\nrepresenting a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023163.tif": "cooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement.

Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023168.tif": "is subject to all rules of the court.!?? Atorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that\natorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct\n(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of\nprofessional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.\nl. FRPC 4-l.l — Competence\nFRPC 4-l.l requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°°\nCompetent representation requires the legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation\nreasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors\nrelevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular mater include “the relative\ncomplexity and specialized nature of the mater, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s\ntraining and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give\nthe mater, and whether it is feasible to refer the mater to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer\nof established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the\nrequired proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular maters,\ncompetence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.\nThe comment to Rule 4-l.l explains that “[t]he required atention and preparation are determined\nin part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more\nextensive treatment than maters of lesser complexity and consequence.”\n2. FRPC 4-l.3 — Diligence\nFRPC 4-l.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> diligence and promptness in\nrepresenting a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a mater on behalf\nof a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take\nwhatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A\nlawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every\nadvantage that might be realized for a client.”\n3. FRPC 4-4.l — Candor in Dealing with Others\nFRPC 4-4.l prohibits a lawyer from knouingly making a false statement of material fact\nor law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule\nexplains that “[ml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or\nomissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular\nstatement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”\nl99 See also 28 U.S.C. § 53oB(a), providing that government atorneys are subject to state laws and state and\nlocal federal court rules governing atorneys in each state where the government atorney engages in his duties.\n2oo The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United\nStates.

Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nIW. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.tif": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by <span class=\"highlight\">Reasonable</span>\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at... hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jomned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023188.tif": "reconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.tif": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed.

The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n2s4 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023219.tif": "indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and\ndefense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is\nquestionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even\nextend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.\n\nWeighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution\nthat ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a\nmechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern\nabout intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would\nbe sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the\ntime that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of\nthe conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to\ntrial, would we risk losing everything?”\n\nDuring the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept\na plea for an l8-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-\nyear term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia\natributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, but Acosta atributed it to a decision\nmade during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his\natorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.\n\nOPR found no contemporaneous documents shouing the basis for the two-year term.\nDespite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR\nwas unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that\nterm, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was setled on for the initial offer. The\nterm was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as\nOPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the\ndefense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and\nrather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the\nnegotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was\ntied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other\ntraditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar\ncrimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a\npunishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the\nUSAO had litle room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to\nenforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration\nthat was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly\ndisproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.\n\nIn sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him\nto arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his oun goal of serving as a “backstop” to the\nstate, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> basis. In assessing the case\nonly through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for\na punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in\naddressing it.\n\nl8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.tif": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.tif": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n257 In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.tif": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023229.tif": "Bill of Rights in the VRRA.?® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. 74\nB.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023256.tif": "review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive interpretation” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “‘to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*”” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span>, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.**4 Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2328o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023281.tif": "leters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the mater was\n“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that\nEpstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ atorney prior to Epstein’s\nstate plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\nintention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023285.tif": "CHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nl.

Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”?”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\n\n397 Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.tif": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘<span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.””\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023306.tif": "particular charges and victims at issue.

No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct.

Telephone Calls\nThe federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54o.loo-54o.lo6, that govern telephone calls for inmates require that\nthe Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate telephone conversations, which\nis “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution and to protect the public.” For\nsafety and security reasons, BOP policy (Program Statement P5264.o8, Inmate Telephone Regulations)\nrequires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System. BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb. Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens\nFederal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in administrative detention status ordinarily\nmay have a <span class=\"highlight\">reasonable</span> amount of personal property.'° Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal\nproperty of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”\"®\nThe BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU. Restricted medications\nare administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each institution determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post\nOrders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove\nall limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed. These\nPost Orders further specify that all cells are to be cleaned daily by inmates occupying the cell, and that\nblankets, touels, and other linens will not be used as rugs or hung over inmate bunk beds at any time.\nPursuant to these Post Orders, MCC New York housing unit officers on all three shifts are responsible for\nmaintaining “a high level of sanitation” and a “safe and clean environment.”\n5 28 C.F.R. § 54l.3l (h)(l).\nl6 BOP Program Statement 527o.ll, Special Housing Units.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2338o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023748.tif": "period with government issued picture identification, such as a\ndrivers license.

Inmate Designations\nThe majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates\nwho, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another\ninstitution. Houever, an inmate is not transported to a new\ninstitution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement ana commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.
