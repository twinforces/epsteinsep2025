For l5 of those years, I\nserved in the United Kingdom Special Forces.

I hold numerous instructional and\noperational licenses qualifying me to deliver several types of security services under the UK\nSecurity Industry Authority, including a certification to provide close protection services for\nindividuals facing physical threats. I am a member of the Academy of Security Intelligence and\nRisk Studies and have ouned and operated security companies in all capacities in a number of\ndifferent countries.\n\n2.

Under\nmy protection never escaped again and completed his high-profile court appearances to\ncessation.\n\n3.

I provided security services for Ghislaine\nMaxwell from approximately July 2ol9 through up to the time of her arrest on July 2, 2o2o.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell faced a number of security issues. For example, I was aware that she received a\nnumber of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 2o years\npreviously.

David Perry QC\n\nl.l. David Perry QC is a barrister and former head of chambers at 6K BW College Hill. From\nl99l to l997, he was one of the Standing Counsel to the Department of Trade and\nIndustry. From l997 to 2ool, he was Junior Treasury Counsel to the Croun at the Central\nCriminal Court and Senior Treasury Counsel from 2ool until 2oo6, when he ‘took silk’\n(i.e. was appointed Queen’s Counsel). He is a deputy High Court Judge and a judge of\nthe Court of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nl.2. Mr Perry prosecutes and defends and has extensive experience of extradition and mutual\nlegal assistance cases, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. He is a member of the\nEditorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and a joint editor of Blackstone’s Criminal\nPractice, a leading practitioners’ work.\n\n2. Extradition — Experience and Expertise\n\n2.l. Mr Perry is widely considered one of the UK’s pre-eminent extradition practitioners and\nis listed as such in the leading industry journals. He has acted on behalf of many overseas\ngovernments and appeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in the\nleading cases. He has acted as an expert <span class=\"highlight\">consultant</span> to the Commonwealth Secretariat on\ninternational co-operation and has advised overseas governments on the drafting and\nimplementation of their domestic legislation.\n\n3. Independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements\n\n3.l. In 2oll/l2, together with Lord Justice Scot Baker and Anand Doobay, Mr Perry was\nappointed by the UK Government to conduct the Home Office’s Independent Review of\nthe UK’s extradition arrangements. The review formed the basis of changes to the\nExtradition Act 2oo3.\n\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the follouing five areas:\n® the Home Secretary’s discretionary pouers to stop extradition.\n\ne the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition\nrequests between European countries.\n\ne where a crime is mainly commited in the UK, whether the person should be tried\nin the UK.\n\ne whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n\ne whether requesting countries should be required to provide sufficient evidence to\nprove an allegation.\n\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 3o September\n2oll, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK’s extradition arrangements.\nPart 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United\nStates and United Kingdom under the 2oo3 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the\neffectiveness of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors’ observations\non the procedures under the treaty. Their conclusion was that the 2oo3 treaty was\noperating fairly and there was no basis to seek its renegotiation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ll4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002373.jpg": "GeaSell2 sce MOFABARW SP QOURIRREABE2] FilKedORzIOHS!

A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol. Pub. Pol’y & L. 3l2, 328 (2o2o); see also id. at 325\n(“Psychologists serving as jury consultants have concurred with the later: ‘Sexually based\noffenses are particularly complicated because jurors may possess personal victimization histories\n... Jurors with personal abuse histories are unlikely to be impartial.’’).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s press statements reflect actual bias. He stated his oun sexual abuse\nexperience predisposed him to credit the stories of sexual abuse complainants despite delays in\nreporting and memory lapses. His oun experience, in his oun mind, left him predisposed to reject\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009281.jpg": "Case E28 DOBSON BOC CT lRileed@) 829lZA/2PagPage2s9 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, y\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf.

With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien.

In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V).

Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “<span class=\"highlight\">Consultant</span> to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023884.jpg": "7/29/2ol9 Atorney Directory - Atorney Details\nAtorney ir —~p = TS ‘ COURTS\nSearch was OURTS\nAtorney .
