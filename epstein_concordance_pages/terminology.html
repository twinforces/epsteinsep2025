Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “<span class=\"highlight\">terminology</span>” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDEL, as it did\nelsewhere in the NPA, and provided that “the United States Atorney’s Office . .. will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Again, it did\nnot. It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a reasonable alternative explanation for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision.

Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “<span class=\"highlight\">terminology</span>” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o4 of 349\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, <span class=\"highlight\">terminology</span>, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of rape.

Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll. Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.\nThe more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the\nDaubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at lo97. It is the jury’s\nrole to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\n\nLast, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense’s Daubert motion.\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual\nabuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is\nunreliable. The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. <span class=\"highlight\">Terminology</span>\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this phenomenon is not identified in the relevant literature regarding child sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader principle of hou grooming functions through the development\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions about grooming,\nhouever, remain admissible under the Rule 7o2 and Daubert standard and remain relevant\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page4ofl27 4\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl parties on issues, some I'm prepared to resolve without further\n2 discussion.
