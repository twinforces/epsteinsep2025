The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense.

Berman, U.S.D.J.\n\nDear Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an anonymous\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000769.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of5\nBSF\naffirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\nTheir consent to disclosure should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001133.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd36couAuNit Dibeudre/itl $7o 2 il SO 42ARM 26agedGe ST BHA5\na very small fraction of the discovery pertains in any way to the individuals we believe to be\nthe three complainants named in the indictment, and none of it corroborates any allegations\nof “grooming” or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or a conspiracy with Epstein involving Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFor example, the government represented to the Court that it had “diary entries” that\ncorroborated the witness testimony, suggesting that more than one of the complainants had\nkept contemporaneous diaries that implicated Ms. Maxwell.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv. Maxwell aight have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,\nFrance Details Modeling Agent in Jeffrey Epstein Inquiry, htps://www.theguardian.com/world/2o2o/dec/l7/france-\ndetains-modelling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-in-jeffrey-epstein-inquiry.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n* See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

There can be no doubt that the MDC was follouing\ndirectives from Atorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that\nMs. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the\nMDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general\npopulation, knouing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and\nextortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government’s\nOctober 6, 2o2o leter requesting the Court’s permission to delay the disclosure of photographs\nand documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the\n“Materials”), pursuant to Rule l6(d)(l) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny.’\n\nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule l6\nbecause the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shoun\ngood cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\n' We note that yesterday we sent the government a leter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements\n\nor writen communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.\n\nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”\nDOJ-OGR-ooool795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001797.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 3\nB. Discussion\nl. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 4 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nFor example, Count Five alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the follouing exchange:\n\nQ: Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual\n\nmassages? If you knou.\n\nA: [don’t knou what you’re talking about.\n\nSimilarly, Count Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the follouing exchange:\n\nQ: Other than yourself... with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities?\n\nA: Lwasn’t aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when I was\n\nwith him other than myself.\n\nQ: I want to make sure that I’m clear. Is it your testimony that in the l99os and\n\n2ooos, you were not aware that Ms. Epstein was having sexual activities with\nanyone other than yourself... ?\n\nA: That is my testimony, that is correct.\n\nThe government has spoken to numerous individuals who claim to have been assaulted by Epstein\nafter l997, but do not implicate Ms. Maxwell in the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or claim that she knew about it in any\nway. That bolsters Ms. Maxwell’s defense that she was not aware of either Epstein’s scheme to\nrecruit and sexually abuse underage girls, or that Epstein was engaging in sexual activities with\nothers, and therefore did not perjure herself in response to those questions.\n\nAccordingly, the Materials and the prior statements of the witnesses to whom they pertain\nare exculpatory evidence inconsistent with the government’s theory of the charges in the\nIndictment and must be disclosed pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations.\n\n2. The Government Has Not Shoun Good Cause that Disclosure of the Materials Will\nInterfere with an Ongoing Investigation\n\nEven if the Court does not find this evidence to be exculpatory, the Materials are “material\nto preparing the defense” and therefore should be disclosed under Rule l6(a)(l)(E). The\ngovernment agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good cause to\ndelay the production of the Materials until eight weeks before trial, pursuant to Rule l6(d). (Dkt.\n6o at 2-3). The government’s justification for the delay, houever, is entirely inadequate to\nestablish good cause.\n\nThe government asserts that disclosing the Materials will prematurely reveal to the defense\nthe identities of certain victims of Epstein who are not referenced in the Indictment, as well as\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002009.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 37 of 45\na very small fraction of the discovery pertains in any way to the individuals we believe to be\nthe three complainants named in the indictment, and none of it corroborates any allegations\nof “grooming” or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or a conspiracy with Epstein involving Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFor example, the government represented to the Court that it had “diary entries” that\ncorroborated the witness testimony, suggesting that more than one of the complainants had\nkept contemporaneous diaries that implicated Ms. Maxwell.

As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,\nFrance Details Modeling Agent in Jeffrey Epstein Inquiry, htps://www.theguardian.com/world/2o2o/dec/l 7/france-\ndetains-modelling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-in-jeffrey-epstein-inquiry.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo222o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 8 of 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy.

The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 96 of 349\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!’? At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the reliability of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nafter the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil atorneys to pursue financial\ncompensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-lo).\nDA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he\nviewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never\nbe prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at lo-l3, l6-l8). Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at l3-\nl5). Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at l8). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2 of 8o\n[J-loo-2o2o]\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nMIDDLE DISTRICT\nBAER, C.J., SAYLOR, TODD, DONOHUE, DOUGHERTY, WECHT, MUNDY, JJ.\nCOMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, > No. 39 MAP 2o2o\nAppellee : Appeal from the Order of Superior\n: Court at No. 33l4 EDA 2ol8 dated\n: December lo, 2ol9 Affirming the\nV. : Judgment of Sentence dated\n: September 25, 2ol8 of the\n: Montgomery Court of Common\nWILLIAM HENRY COSBY JR., : Pleas, Criminal Division, at No. CP-\n> 46-CR-3932-2ol6\nAppellant :\n: ARGUED: December l, 2o2o\nOPINION\nJUSTICE WECHT DECIDED: June 3o, 2o2l\nIn 2oo5, Montgomery County District Atorney Bruce Castor learned that Andrea\nConstand had reported that William Cosby had sexually assaulted her in 2oo4 at his\nCheltenham residence.

In evaluating the\nlikelinood of a successful prosecution of Cosby, the district atorney foresaw difficulties\nwith Constand’s credibility as a witness based, in part, upon her decision not to file a\ncomplaint promptly. D.A. Castor further determined that a prosecution would be\nfrustrated because there was no corroborating forensic evidence and because testimony\nfrom other potential claimants against Cosby likely was inadmissible under governing\nlaws of evidence.

She did not report to the authorities what Cosby had\ndone to her.\n\nA few months later, Constand moved back to her native Canada. She spoke with\nCosby over the telephone, mostly about an upcoming Toronto performance that he had\nscheduled. Cosby invited Constand and her family to the shou, which especially excited\nConstand’s mother, who had atended two of Cosby’s other performances and who\nbrought a gift for Cosby to the shou.\n\nConstand kept the January 2oo4 incident to herself for nearly a year, until one night\nin January 2oo5, when she bolted awake crying and decided to call her mother for advice.\nInitially, Constand’s mother could not talk because she was en route to work, but she\nreturned Constand’s call immediately upon arrival. During the call, Constand told her\nmother that Cosby had sexually assaulted her approximately one year earlier. Together,\nthe two decided that the best course of action was to contact the Durham Regional Police\nDepartment in Ontario, Canada, and to atempt to retain legal counsel in the United\nStates.\n\nThat night, Constand filed a police report with the Durham Regional Police\nDepartment. Shortly thereafter, Constand called Cosby, but he did not answer his phone.\nWhen Cosby returned the call the next day, both Constand and her mother were on the\nline. Constand brought up the January 2oo4 incident and asked Cosby to identify the\nthree blue pills that he had given to her that night. Cosby apologized vaguely. As to the\npills, Cosby feigned ignorance, promising Constand that he would check the label on the\nprescription botle from which they came and relay that information to her.\n\nFrustrated, Constand left the call, but her mother remained on the line and\ncontinued to speak with Cosby. Cosby assured Constand’s mother that he did not have\nsexual intercourse with Constand while she was incapacitated. Neither Constand nor her\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 8 of 8o\nmother informed Cosby that Constand had filed a police report accusing him of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nConstand later telephoned Cosby again and, unbeknounst to Cosby, recorded the\nconversation with a tape recorder that she had purchased. During this conversation,\nCosby offered to continue assisting Constand if she still desired to work in sports\nbroadcasting. He also indicated that he would pay for Constand to continue her\neducation. Cosby asked Constand to meet him in person to discuss these maters further,\nand told her that he would have someone contact her to set up the meeting. As with the\nprevious call, Cosby again refused to identify the pills that he had provided to Constand\non the night of the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nWithin days of filing the police report, Constand received two telephone messages\nfrom people associated with Cosby. The first message was from one of Cosby’s\nassistants, calling on Cosby’s behalf to invite Constand and her mother to Cosby’s\nupcoming performance in Miami, Florida. Constand called the representative back and\nrecorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her\nmother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them. Constand declined the\noffer and did not provide the requested information. Constand then received a message\nfrom one of Cosby’s atorneys, who stated that he was calling to discuss the creation of\na trust that Cosby wanted to set up in order to provide financial assistance for Constand’s\neducation. Constand never returned the atorney’s call.\n\nIn the meantime, the Durham Regional Police Department referred Constand’s\npolice report to the Philadelphia Police Department, which, in turn, referred it to the\nCheltenham Police Department in Montgomery County, where Cosby’s residence was\nlocated. The case was assigned to Sergeant Richard Schaeffer, who worked in tandem\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo482o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 8o\nwith the Montgomery County Detective Bureau and the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office to investigate Constand’s allegation.\n\nSergeant Schaeffer first spoke with Constand by telephone on January l9, 2oo5.\nAccording to Sergeant Schaeffer, Constand seemed nervous throughout this brief initial\ninterview. Thereafter, Constand traveled from Canada to Cheltenham to meet with the\ninvestigating team in person. Because this was Constand’s first time meeting with law\nenforcement personnel, she felt nervous and uncomfortable while discussing with them\nthe intimate nature of her allegations.\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then-Montgomery County District Atorney Bruce Castor\nissued a press release informing the public that Cosby was under investigation for sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Sergeant Schaeffer and other law enforcement officials interviewed Cosby in\nNew York City, utilizing a writen question and answer format. Cosby was accompanied\nby his atorneys, Walter M. Phillips, Esquire, and John P. Schmit, Esquire. Cosby\nreported that Constand had come to his home at least three times during their social and\nromantic relationship. Cosby claimed that, on the night in question, Constand came to\nhis house complaining of an inability to sleep. Cosby stated that he told Constand that,\nwhen he travels, he takes Benadryl, an antihistamine, which immediately makes him\ndrousy. According to Cosby, he then handed Constand one-and-a-half Benadryl pills,\nbut did not tell her what they were.\n\nCosby recalled that, once Constand ingested the pills, they kissed and touched\neach other on the couch. Cosby admited that he touched Constand’s breasts and vagina,\nbut he insisted that she neither resisted nor told him to stop. Additionally, Cosby told the\ninvestigators that he never removed his clothing and that Constand did not touch any part\nof his body under his clothes. Cosby denied having sexual intercourse with Constand\nand disclaimed any intent to do so that night. In fact, Cosby claimed that the two never\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo482l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. Cosby admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—Cosby provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand Cosby’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against Cosby troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 8o\nphone calls were being recorded. Although he did not believe that Constand was making\nthese allegations in an atempt to get money from him, Cosby explained that, after\nConstand and her mother confronted him, he offered to pay for her education and asked\nhis atorney to commence discussions regarding seting up a trust for that purpose.\nCosby admited that it would be in his best interests if the public believed that Constand\nhad consented to the encounter, and that he believed he would suffer financial\nconsequences if the public believed that he had drugged and assaulted her.\n\nNotably, during his depositions, Cosby confessed that, in the past, he had provided\nQualudes®*—not Benadrylto other women with whom he wanted to have sexual\nintercourse.\n\nEventually, Constand setled her civil suit with Cosby for $3.38 million.’ Initially,\nthe terms of the setlement and the records of the case, including Cosby’s depositions,\nwere sealed. Houever, follouing a media request, the federal judge who presided over\nthe civil suit unsealed the records in 2ol5.\n\nBy that point, then-D.A. Castor had moved on from the district atorney's office and\nwas serving as a Montgomery County Commissioner. He was succeeded as district\natorney by his former first assistant, Risa Vetri Ferman, Esquire.‘° Despite her\npredecessor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, upon release of the civil records, District\nAtorney Ferman reopened the criminal investigation of Constand’s allegations.

Members of the prosecutorial team\ntraveled to Canada and met with Constand, asking her to cooperate with their efforts to\nprosecute Cosby, even though she had specifically agreed not to do so as part of the civil\nsetlement. Investigators also began to identify, locate, and interview other women that\nhad claimed to have been assaulted by Cosby.\n\nNearly a decade after D.A.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr.

Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2l of 8o\nLikewise, he did not recall the specific statement, “[i]n Pennsylvania we\ncharged people for criminal conduct. We don’t charge people with making\na mistake or doing something foolish;” houever, he indicated that it is a true\nstatement.\n\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, [Cosby] gave a full statement to law\nenforcement and his Pennsylvania and New York homes were searched.\n[Cosby] was accompanied by counsel and did not invoke the Fifth\nAmendment at any time during the statement. After [Cosby's] interview,\nMs. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally\nmet with Ms. Constand. Follouing that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.\nCastor spoke to [Cosby’s] atorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told\nMr. Castor that during the year between the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and the report, Ms.\nConstand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also\nconcerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.\nPhillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the\nrecorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were\natempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the\npolice. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips\nthought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to\nobtain the records. Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an\n“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand\nafter the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire\ninterceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.\nAs part of the 2oo5 investigation, allegations made by other women were\nalso investigated. Mr. Castor delegated that investigation to Ms. Ferman.\nHe testified that he determined that, in his opinion, these allegations were\nunreliable.\nFollouing approximately one month of investigation, Mr. Castor concluded\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidenced upon which\nany charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident could be\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.” He testified that he could either leave\nthe case open at that point or definitively close the case to allou a civil case.\nHe did not believe there was a chance that the criminal case could get any\nbeter. He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that\ncould not be overcome.\nMr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in\nexchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he\ntold Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the\nanalysis and directed her to contact Constand’s atorneys. He testified that\nshe was to contact the atorneys to let them knou that “Cosby was not going\nto be prosecuted and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25.

Castor never, in\nfact, reached an agreement with Cosby, or even promised Cosby that the Commonwealth\nwould not prosecute him for assaulting Constand. T.C.O. at 62. Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\nCommonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 37 of 8o\ndrink or a pill, often at Cosby’s insistence; that each woman became incapacitated and\nunable to consent to sexual contact; and that Cosby sexually assaulted each woman\nwhile each was under the influence of the intoxicant. /d. at lo3-o4. These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d. Accordingly, “the fact that numerous other women recounted the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 38 of 8o\nsame or similar story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine\nof chances.” /d.\n\nThe trial court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts\nwitnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor that the\ncourt should consider.” /d. at 97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting Commonwealth v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 39 of 8o\n\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> as a consensual encounter.” /d. “Furthermore,” the court opined, “Ms.\nConstand did not report the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> until approximately one year later, further supporting\nthe Commonwealth’s need for the evidence.” /d. at llo. With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the conclusion of a second jury trial, Cosby was convicted on all three counts of\naggravated indecent <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l.

Accordingly, the panel\nconcluded that the witnesses’ testimony was admissible to shou Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design.\n\nThe Superior Court further agreed with the trial court that the prior bad acts\nevidence was admissible to demonstrate the absence of mistake on Cosby’s part as to\nConstand’s consent. The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the relationship between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> involving different victims to be identical in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2. The court added that it would be “simply unreasonable” to require\ntwo incidents to be absolutely identical in order to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), and\nconcluded that “[i]t is the patern itself, and not the mere presence of some inconsistencies\nbetween the various assaults, that determines admissibility under these exceptions.” /d.\n\nAs to the temporal gap between the prior bad acts and the incident involving\nConstand, the Superior Court acknouledged that, even if the evidence were otherwise\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b), it “will be rendered inadmissible if it is too remote.” /d. at\n4o5 (quoting Commonwealth v. Shively, 424 A.2d l257, l259 (Pa. l98l)). The panel\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4854\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 43 of 8o\nagreed with the trial court’s statement that the significance of the age of a prior bad act is\n“inversely proportional” to the similarity between the prior bad act and the facts underlying\nthe charged offense. /d. (quoting Commonwealth v. Aikens, 99o A.2d ll8l, ll85 (Pa.\nSuper. 2olo)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>—recklessness.” /d.

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 355 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\n\nbelieve that counsel will be beter than the Court at identifying bias, nor that counsel will be more\ninterested than the Court in removing biased jurors. Indeed, it is unlikely that atorney-led\nquestioning will yield a significant change in the candidness and openness of prospective jurors if\nthe Court also limits those questions to one minute per juror, as the defense also proposes. (/d. at\nl4). Given that prospective jurors are likely to “respond honestly to questions directed to them by\na federal judge,” Saipov, 2o2o WL 958527, at *l, Court-led voir dire remains appropriate in this\ncase.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this\nDistrict of Court-led voir dire should be folloued.

Individual “Sequestered” Voir Dire Is Not Warranted\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this District\nshould be folloued; that is, the Court should ask most questions in open court and ask sensitive\nquestions, such as those that relate to sexual abuse and media exposure, at sidebar. The defendant\nargues that individual sequestered voir dire is necessary in light of the nature of the charges in this\ncase, which she claims are “particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from\nwhich jurors are drawn,” and her concern that “a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the\nentire jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity.”\n(Dkt. No. 342 at 8-9).

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from\npsychologist in prosecution for traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex\nwith a minor because psychologist’s “experience in the field of child sexual abusers and their\nvictims is one-sided, as it is limited to therapeutic sessions with victims of sexual abuse,” and\nbecause she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l-NGG-\nVMS, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.\nEssef Corp., 434 F. Supp. 2d l69, l92 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (expert not “permited to testify\nregarding” subjects “outside the expertise of the witness’’).\n\n2. Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v.

Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 395 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\nthe accusers, violates the presumption of innocence, and lessens the government’s burden of\nproof. E.g., Jackson, 6oo A.2d at 24 (“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not\nbe used in a case where the commission of a crime is in dispute.’’).\n\nIn State v. Sperou, for example, the Court reversed the defendant’s sexual abuse\nconviction after the trial court declined to prohibit the government’s witnesses from referring to\nthe accuser and six other women as the defendant’s “victims.” 442 P.3d 58l, 585 (Or. 2ol9). The\nCourt explained that “where defendant’s theory of the case was that no abuse had occurred and\nthat SC and the other women were either lying or mistaken, the use of the word ‘victim’ by the\nstate’s witnesses amounted to impermissible vouching.” /d. Use of the word “victim,” elaborated\nthe Court, “undermine[s] the presumption of defendant’s innocence because it assumes\ndefendant’s guilt, a fact that is necessarily not proved until the jury finds the defendant guilty.”\nId. at 59o. Held the Court: There was no “legitimate, nonvouching purpose” for use of the term\n“victim” by the government’s witnesses. /d. at 594.\n\nThe Court reached the same conclusion in State v. Devey, l38 P.3d 9o, 95 (Utah App. Ct.\n2oo6). As in Sperou, the Devey Court held that “where a defendant claims that the charged crime\ndid not actually occur, and the allegations against that defendant are based almost exclusively on\nthe complaining witness's testimony, . . . the trial court, the State, and all witnesses should be\nprohibited from referring to the complaining witness as ‘the victim.’” /d. Use of the term\n“victim,” agreed the Court, “lends credence to [the accuser’s] testimony that the assaults\noccurred and that she was, indeed, a victim.” /d. (quoting Veteto v. State, 8 S.W.3d 8o5, 8l6-l7\n(Tex. App. Ct. 2ooo)).

But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v.

Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure.

The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed disclosure helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed disclosure are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 43\n\n958 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 8 of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 43\n\n976 N.

It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005894.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time.

See Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharm., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 592 &\nn.lo (l993) (citing Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. l7l, l75-76 (l987)). A district court’s\nexclusion of expert testimony will be affirmed unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion. See\nGen. Elec. Co. v.

This “opinion” should be precluded.\n\n4. Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\npersonality traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion. To appreciate the audacity of the defense approach, consider\nif the Government atempted to do something similar. If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2. Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “[flalse allegations of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> do occur” (Ex. A at 7), is not helpful to the jury. There will be no dispute that allegations\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 4l\n9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that is directed solely to\nlay maters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\n(internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nEven as to the opinions that involve psychological conditions, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are not\nhelpful to the jury. While Dr. Dietz’s descriptions of antisocial personality disorder, borderline\npersonality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychotic disorders, delirium, dissociation,\nand intellectual disability at least involve Dr. Dietz’s psychiatric training in some way (unlike\npathways such as “lying”), it is hardly beyond the ken of juries to knou that mental disorders or\naltered mental states may at times motivate people to dissemble or to believe things that are not\ntrue. Atempting to put the imprimatur of an expert on a variety of ways in which mental disorders\ncan lead to unreliable testimony is simply an atempt to invade the province of the jury by puting\na thumb on the scale in their assessment of witness credibility.’ See, e.g., Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398\n(“[E]xpert opinions that constitute evaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations\nare rooted in scientific or technical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2”); United States v.\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (barring expert from testifying as to scientific principle\nrelated to the assessment of witness credibility as impinging on jury’s role).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinions include something outside the ken of the average jury—\nspecifically, that these “pathways” purportedly occur frequently in sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> cases—they are\n7Dr. Dietz should in any event not offer his opinions on false memory, which are apparently\nderivative of Dr. Loftus’s. Given that the defense has noticed Dr. Loftus as a witness, if any false\nmemory testimony is appropriate, it should come from Dr. Loftus, whose research it is based on,\nnot from Dr. Dietz summarizing Dr. Loftus’s research. The admissibility of Dr. Loftus’s testimony\non false memory is discussed in Section II, infra.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 4l\n\nnot reliable. The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 27 of 4l\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that individuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of\nmental disorders than individuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and that these disorders\ncan affect memory and recall, is prejudicial and unhelpful. Offering this opinion in this form can\nonly serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category,\nare more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz\nacknouledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a “‘case-by-case basis” (Ex. A at ll),\nthat case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and\nstereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that “significant proportions” of victims exhibit post-traumatic\nstress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are\n“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> event.” (Ex. A at ll).\n\nThis opinion is confusing and appears not to be relevant to the facts of the case. First, Dr.\nDietz’s conclusion that victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms are unlikely to\n“unnecessarily recreate a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> event” is illogical given that it appears to place the\nresponsibility on the victim for experiencing repeated assaults, and at a minimum he should be\nrequired to disclose comprehensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as unlikely.\n\nSecond, a critical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers—\nincluding the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential between them and the abusers—\nand those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s testimony primarily addresses the later category,\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is irrelevant and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4o of 4l\ndoes not share the defense’s view of the law, to the extent the Court accepts that view, Dr. Loftus\nand Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\nThis point is valid in a number of respects, but three in particular bear noting. First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4l of 4l\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that:\n\ne Dr. Dietz be permited to testify in response to Dr. Rocchio, limited to the opinion that\ngrooming does not have one setled definition;\n\ne Dr. Dietz be precluded from offering opinions regarding hindsight bias, the Halo effect,\npathways to false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, factors bearing on witness credibility, and\npost-traumatic stress symptoms, or in the alternative that a hearing be held;\n\ne Dr. Loftus be precluded from offering opinions regarding commonsense principles of\nmemory, factors bearing on witness credibility, factual narratives, or false memory\nformation.\n\nDated: November 8, 2o2l\nNew York, New York\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\nBy: /s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672.

Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Without clear physical evidence, the\ndecisions of the legal system are based merely on the relative credibility of\nthe narratives of the persons involved.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5of 29\n\nPathways to False Allegations 99\nbut not sufficient conditions for false allegations. There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL <span class=\"highlight\">ASSAULT</span>\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6 of 29\n\nloo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lol\n\nThe determination that a report of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is false can be\n\nmade only if the evidence establishes that no crime was commited or\n\natempted. This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false. Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation. On March l3, 2oo6, the\nlacrosse team at Duke University hired two exotic dancers, Crystal Magnum\nand Kim Roberts, to perform at a house party (Hemmens, 2oo8). While\nat the house, Magnum fell unconscious for a short while after which an\nexchange of insults occurred between the lacrosse team and the two strip-\npers. Roberts then drove Magnum to a store where she was dropped off.\nAfter being arrested for public drunkenness, Magnum accused three of the\nDuke lacrosse teammates of rape. The allegations were pursued over the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL <span class=\"highlight\">ASSAULT</span>\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page lo of 29\nlo4 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo7\nIntoxication\nAs a prerequisite for this pathway, the consumption of intoxicating sub-\nstances must have led to distortions in information processing. There\nare currently many drugs that are used by sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> perpetrators to\nincapacitate victims (Horvath & Broun, 2oo5). These drugs may include\nRohypnol (e.g., “roofies”) and amphetamines, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or\nantihistamines. Other drugs, such as gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and\nketamine have also been indicated in drug-assisted sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> cases (see\nHorvath & Broun, 2oo5; Hindmarch & Brinkmann, l999). In a forensic case,\nit is important to determine whether the accuser voluntarily or involuntarily\nconsumed drugs. If the drugs were not voluntarily consumed, it is likely that\nthe individual who drugged the claimant had premeditated plans to control\nthe claimant (Welner, 2ool), regardless of whether the perpetrator assaulted\nthe claimant.\n\nThough consent issues are clearly important considerations when\ndetermining the nature of sexual behaviors while intoxicated, they are super-\nfluous considerations in this pathway. Under most state laws, a person\ncannot legally consent to sexual activity while intoxicated (Davis & Loftus,\n2oo8). In fact, even if consent to engage in sexual activity is ex ante (before\nthe first dose of the intoxicating substance), the act of engaging in sex-\nual activity while intoxicated can later be determined to be non-consensual\nsexual activity and is often sufficient evidence to convict someone of rape.\nTherefore, issues of consent, for these reasons, will not be discussed in the\ncontext of this pathway.\n\nA key issue in this pathway is whether the claimant believes that he\nor she was sexually assaulted while under the influence of intoxicating sub-\nstances, when in reality no sexual activity took place or activity occurred very\ndifferent from what she is nou claiming (e.g., she claimed penetration when\nno penetration occurred). Some drugs, when consumed at sufficient levels,\nmay cause impairments in information processing—sensation, perception,\nstorage, or retrieval. Substances knoun to cause these effects are alco-\nhol, sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, soporifics), and anxiolytics\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). High doses of alcohol have been\nshoun to inhibit memory in humans and animals (Bisby, Leitz, Morgan, &\nCurran, 2olo; Crego et al., 2oo9; Spineta et al., 2oo8). Moreover, upon ceas-\ning to use these drugs, withdrawal symptoms may include delirium and\npsychotic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; Lin, Heacock, &\nFogel, in press)—two additional pathways to false allegations that will be\ndiscussed later in this paper.\n\nThe information-processing errors of the intoxicating substances men-\ntioned above may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while\na person was intoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nthat occurred while he or she was under the influence or while experienc-\ning the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may atempt to make\nsense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events\nthat occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\nDiagnostic criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway. If an individual with antisocial personality disorder is likely to lie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l5 of 29\n\nPathways to False Allegations lo9\n\nto achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> might be\n\nthe means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\n\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggres-\n\nsive act fiting diagnostic criterion 4. Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, men may also\nreport sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 29\nllo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nWhen parsing these domains, it can be more clearly seen hou BPD may\nserve as a pathway for false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. The first domain\n(Leib et al., 2oo4) includes the diagnostic criterion of quickly switching from\nidealization to devaluation of relationship (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD\nmay be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant\nothers or lovers to devaluing them (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\nThis sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feel-\ning that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion\nof abandonment. The rapid shifting between idealizing and demonization\nmay bring about a change in perspective such that a relationship that was\nviewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse”\nand may lead a person with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nAs Kanin (l994) found in his longitudinal study, two of the three major\nmotivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship\nand/or relationship partner (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) may\nspur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devalua-\ntion phase, newly construed as mistreatment. In addition an individual with\nBPD who is feeling fear of abandonment may seek frantically to achieve the\natention that is craved from the partner who is perceived to be neglectful\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). The impulsive nature of a person\nwith BPD may also lead them to act on these motivations for atention or\nrevenge by filing a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> before carefully consid-\nering the consequences. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with\nBPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative” (Linehan, l993).\nManipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the\nindividual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation\nfrequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an indi-\nvidual with BPD may use a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation as a way of impacting\na third party for some desired outcome.\n\nThe second domain (Lieb et al., 2oo4), consisting of symptoms of\nreality-based delusions and hallucinations, may lead to false beliefs of sex-\nual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, and clinical experience suggests that sexuality is a common\ntheme in delusions and hallucinations. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric\nAssociation 2ooo, p. 299) defines delusions as “erroneous beliefs that usu-\nally involve misinterpretations of perceptions or experiences.” Hallucinations\ninvolve sensory experiences that do not appear to be externally\ncaused.\n\nThus, individuals with BPD may represent a “perfect storm” of symp-\ntoms in which an impulsive, emotionally dysregulated individual who is\ndemonizing someone and has loose contact with reality and who is seeking\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l8 of 29\n\nLl2 J. Engle and W. O’Donobue\n\nindividuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-\nulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2l of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll5\nfragmented memories with an individual’s self-concept and worldview, the\nlikelihood of altering memories of events, either consciously or uncon-\nsciously, increases (Eisen & Lynn, 2ool). Thus, it is possible that in the\nevent of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, dissociation may cause a person to fill in the parts\nof the experience that are not clearly remembered with events that for them\nfeasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily\nbe filled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, high\ndissociators may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details\nto an incomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered\nin the context of the event. Thus, these confabulations may lead to erro-\nneous claims that have forensic relevance, including who the perpetrator\nwas, what happened, where, and hou many times.\nIntellectual Disability\nIntellectual disability UD; Schalock, 2oo7), also knoun as mental retarda-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), is characterized by belou-\naverage IQ and adaptive functioning (Schalock, 2oo7; American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo). Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acqui-\nsition of social, occupational, academic, and general self-care skills. ID\nhas several etiologies that often are related to biological or pathological\nprocesses affecting the central nervous system. Many of the specific vulner-\nabilities that arise from ID overlap to some extent with other disorders (e.g.,\nautism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and thus,\nin many cases, individuals with other developmental disabilities may also\nhave ID.\n\nRates of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> are higher in intellectually disabled populations\nthan populations without ID (Mitra, Mouradian, & Diamond, 2oll). It is\nhypothesized that the true rate of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> among individuals with\nID is higher than indicated in studies Goyce, 2oo3). There are many rea-\nsons to believe that study findings are an underrepresentation of the actual\namount of sexual assaults that occur against intellectually disabled people.\nDifficulties with communication and comprehension of language faced by\nindividuals with ID may interfere with the ability to report a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\n(Ahlgrim-Delzell & Dudley, 2ool). Fear of repercussions for reporting—as\ncaregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,\n2oo3). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,\nJoyce (2oo3) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-\ntant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get\ninto trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it\ncan be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 29\nll6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946). Thus, investigative procedures that involve\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and suggestive questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> (e.g., the general location, features of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 29\nll8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “...[W]here father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “. . . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006304.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7 of:\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 of54\n\n“TT here is no absolute right of an accused to have a jury hear a witness’s true name and\naddress.” Clark v. Rickets, 958 F.2d 85l, 855 (9th Cir. l99l). Strong public interests support\nlimiting public disclosure of victim identities and other sensitive information. The Crime\nVictims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. § 377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to\nensure that crime victims are accorded, among other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably\nprotected from the accused,” and “[t]he right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.” Jd. §§ (a)(l), (a)(8).

Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from\npsychologist in prosecution for traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex\nwith a minor because psychologist’s “experience in the field of child sexual abusers and their\nvictims is one-sided, as it is limited to therapeutic sessions with victims of sexual abuse,” and\nbecause she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l-NGG-\nVMS, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.\nEssef Corp., 434 F. Supp. 2d l69, l92 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (expert not “permited to testify\nregarding” subjects “outside the expertise of the witness’’).\n\n2. Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v. Sandoz Pharms.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it.

Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. (dd.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6727\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed disclosure helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed disclosure are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 43\n\n958 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 43\n\n976 N.

It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006819.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

So there are factors that have been studied and found in\n\nll literature that have to do with the individual themselves. So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups.

Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with delayed disclosure?\n\nl7 A. I am.\n\nl8 Q. What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o literature to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 82oofl58 82\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo726l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 89ofl58 89\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives.

The government’s speculative concern about the effect of Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is no reason to exclude it when the Court has ample tools at its disposal to address the\ngovernments (ill-founded) worries.\n\nAlmost as an aside, the government disingenuously suggests that Dr. Dietz’s opinion is\ninadmissible because “it appears” to be based “solely on one interview of Epstein with Steven\nBannon.” Mot. at l7. As the government well knous, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is based on much\nmore. To be sure, Dr. Dietz quoted the interview in his disclosure, Ex. l, p 6, but he also\nreviewed and considered thousands of pages of material before reaching his opinion, including\nmost significantly all the material available to him about the Palm Beach Investigations of Mr.\nEpstein, Ex. l, p l66-69.\n\nD. Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>.\n\nThe government misses the mark in its hyperbolic objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinions about\nthe multiple pathways to false sex <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegations. Mot. at l8-22. The government claims\nthese opinions invade the province of the jury are unreliable and unhelpful. Not so.\n\nFirst, the opinions do not invade the province of the jury because Dr. Dietz is not offering\nan opinion on the truthfulness of the accusers’ allegations in this case. See Nimely v. City of New\nYork, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395—96 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (expert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s]\ndirectly, under the guise of expert opinion, on the credibility of trial testimony from” specific\nfact witnesses.); cf Hygh v. Jacobs, 96l F.2d 359, 364 (2d Cir. l992) (expert not permited to\noffer testimony that “merely [tells] the jury what result to reach’). Dr. Dietz’s opinions rely on\nhis clinical experience and the vast body of literature explaining hou an accuser might come to\nfalsely allege sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nOne point (but by no means the only one) of Dr. Dietz’s opinion is to challenge the\nreliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which she bases on the untested assumption that her\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo748o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page l6 of 28\npatients are telling the truth when they claim to have been abused. See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments. (“Nothing in this\n[rule] is intended to suggest that experience alone--or experience in conjunction with other\nknouledge, skill, training or education--may not provide a sufficient foundation for expert\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo748l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel9 of 28\n\nFinally, the government points to Dr. Dietz’s “acknouledgement” that credibility should\nbe judged on a “case-by-case basis.” Mot at 23. That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is irrelevant and\nshould be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 2o of 28\nquestion—are the accusers in this case telling the truth? The government obviously thinks they\nare. And that’s fine. But it will be up to the jury to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the alleged “victims of sexual assaults . . . [were not] involved an\nongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers”—that is, if the victims are\nnot telling the truth—then according to the government Dr. Dietz’s opinions are unreliable. In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify. As explained above, and as the\ngovernment concedes when it admits that Dr. Dietz can testify about his disagreement with Dr.\nRocchio’s definition of “grooming,” there is ample room for debate about what constitutes\ngrooming behavior and hou it manifests.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reject this “heads the government wins, tails Ms. Maxwell\nloses” argument.\n\nII. Dr. Loftus’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to present cases where memory testimony was\nprecluded. Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on reliability of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases recognize that, in\ncircumstances like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-\noo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (expert testimony regarding\nmemory would be alloued if the case involved issues of suggestive questioning, drug use,\nhallucinations, or repressed or recovered memories).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 8 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672. These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\n\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 9 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>: A\nMeta-Analysis, 2l Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2o2o), pp. loll-lo28. Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and last for varying durations.

A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma.

Individuals with\nany of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or\nfriendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator,\nor to unnecessarily recreate a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> event, any of which would be expected to elicit\nintense distress.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 39 of 375\n\nNourkova, V.V., Bernstein D.M., & Loftus, E.F.

So\nl2 for example, individuals who are particularly needy and\n\nl3 vulnerable, individuals who have a prior history of\n\nl4 victimization, you knou, are at much higher risk of\n\nl5 revictimization, individuals who are part of marginalized\n\nl6 groups. For example, we knou there's very high rates of sexual\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, childhood sexual abuse among especially minority\n\nl8 children or among intellectually and cognitively disabled\n\nl9 children.\n2o We knou that individuals who come from certain types\n2l of family structures can be also at higher risk. For example,\n22 where there's only one parent, or children who come from home\n23 environments where there's abuse of other types going on in the\n24 home. So there might be other siblings who are being abused or\n25 the parents might be engaged -—- one of the parents might be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo793o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 8l of l598o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl extent that someone doesn't recognize that what's happening to\n2 them or doesn't cognitively label it as abuse, obviously that's\n3 not something that can be reported.\n\n4 But then of course the relationship itself also\n\n5 functions to make disclosure less likely, because either the\n\n6 individual has been made, in the course of the relationship, to\n7 feel somewhat responsible, they might feel shame, or they may\n\n8 blame themselves; or to the extent that they've come to care\n\n9 for the person who's harming them, they may be afraid of\n\nlo geting that individual in trouble; or to the extent that the\nll relationship as a whole clearly has positive elements to it\n\nl2 apart from and distinct from the abusive elements, they may --\nl3 it's fulfilling some need on the part of the victim, they may\nl4 be fearful of losing those pieces.\n\nl5 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you\nl6 familiar with delayed disclosure?\n\nl7 A. I am.\n\nl8 Q. What is delayed disclosure?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed disclosure\" is a term that's used in the\n2o literature to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q.

They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo795l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 9o of l5989\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q.

Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span>, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma. Caron Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, et al., Chronicity in Postraumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) and Predictors of Course of Comorbid PTSD in Patients with Anxiety Disorders, l2 J.\nTraumatic Stress (l999), 89-loo.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged\npsychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic\nevent; marked physiological reactions to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the\ntraumatic event; avoidance or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about\nor closely associated with the traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external\nreminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing\nmemories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 27l-272.

The Court would exclude Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis for much the same\nreasons that court identified. First, the Defense has offered no evidence that diagnosis without\nany in-person interview is a reliable and accepted method in Dr. Dietz’s field. /d. at 446.\nSecond, even if reliable, the opinion risks significant Rule 4o3 prejudice because the jury is\nlikely to overweigh Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis. /d. at 447. Expert testimony may not act as a vehicle\nto “offer[ ] a narrative history” of the case to the jury or to simply “‘regurgitate’ the evidence”\nalready available in the record. Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l92\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). Instead, jurors may consider the applicability of the halo effect based on\nevidence in the record, including the anticipated testimony of multiple individuals that interacted\ndirectly with Epstein.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz expects to testify that because victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> often develop\npost-traumatic stress disorder, they avoid situations and feelings that are likely to bring on\nsymptoms of PTSD, including contact with their abusers or wearing clothes gifted by their\nabusers. Notice at ll. The Defense explains that this testimony is relevant because it would\nmean that evidence of alleged victims interacting with Ms. Maxwell or Epstein after they have\nallegedly been abused is probative of whether their allegations of abuse are credible. Def. Br. at\nl5-l6. The Government argues that this opinion blames victims for their abuse, that it does not\nfit the facts of this case because the abuse was not accomplished by physical force, and that Dr.\nDietz does not have a reliable basis for the opinion. Gov’t Br. at 23-25.\n\nThe Court will admit this opinion. Dr. Dietz’s notice includes several citations to studies\nthat link victims of sexual abuse to PTSD, which the Court finds to be a reliable basis for the\nopinion. Notice at ll. The Government may of course cross-examine Dr. Dietz about contrary\nresearch. The Government’s other two objections—that the opinion is victim blaming and that it\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page9ofl7\ndoes not match the particular facts of this case—are similarly appropriate grounds for cross-\nexamination but not for outright exclusion. See Jn re Mirena IUD Prod. Liab. Litig., l69 F.\nSupp. 3d 396, 4l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol6).\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz provides several opinions on “indices in determining the credibility of a\nvictim’s claims.” Notice at lo. The first of these indices is whether “the core details” of an\naccusation remain constant over time. Jd. The second is that an alleged victim’s “emotional\ndistress [is not] predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.” /d. at ll. And third, that victims\nof sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> “have higher rates of mental disorders,” which “can affect memory and recall.”\nId. As the Court explained in its opinion admiting Dr. Rocchio, “expert opinions that constitute\nevaluations of witness credibility, even when such evaluations are rooted in scientific or\ntechnical expertise, are inadmissible under Rule 7o2.” Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398. “And, a\nwitness’s demeanor on the stand . . . impacts the assessment of credibility” by the jury. United\nStates v. Lumpkin, l92 F.3d 28o, 289 (2d Cir. l999) (emphasis added).\n\nWith this law in mind, the Defense explains that Dr. Dietz’s credibility testimony is\nrelevant primarily to argue that Dr. Rocchio improperly believed her clients’ claims of sexual\nabuse. Def. Br. at l3-l4. The Defense says that professionals in Dr. Rocchio’s field would\nevaluate their client’s claims in a clinical seting and that in a forensic seting Dr. Rocchio erred\nin believing alleged victim’s claims based on their outward emotions. /d.\n\nThe Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s opinions on witness credibility. First, they have only\nmarginal relevance. At the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio made clear that when serving clients in\nher clinical capacity, she does not “go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical\nroom.” Nov. lo Tr. at l6. As she explained, “in a clinical seting, it is not [her] role to\ndetermine whether something is or is not true.” /d. at 4o. Therefore, Dr. Dietz’s opinion about\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagellofl7\ntestimony for a permissible purpose, the Court finds a substantial risk that jurors will instead use\nDr. Dietz’s testimony to evaluate the credibility of witnesses before them. This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel4ofl7\n“that false memories can be described with confidence, detail, and emotion” without\n“deliberately lying.” And fifth, that “suggestive activities” can explain hou alleged victims of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can develop later “memories” of sexual abuse that did not actually happen. As\npart of this last opinion, the notice states that “Dr. Loftus would identify some of the suggestive\nactivities that occurred in the current case.” /d. at 2.\n\nThe Government seeks to exclude most or all of these opinions because they are\nunreliable, fall within the ken of the jury, impermissibly bear on witness credibility, or act as\nvehicles for factual narratives of the case. Def. Br. at 3o-35.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, based on her expert notice and the atached CV, the Court finds\nDr. Loftus to be qualified to offer these opinions based on both her experience and formal\neducation. Dr. Loftus is a frequent expert witness in state courts. /d. at l9 (collecting cases).\nBut the Court also observes that a significant number of federal courts have excluded her expert\nopinions for lack of reliability and fit. E.g., United States v. Shiraishi, No. CR l7-oo582 JMS-\nRLP, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4 (D. Haw. Mar. 27, 2ol9); R.D. v. Shohola, Inc., No. 3:l6-CV-\nolo56, 2ol9 WL 6o53223, at *lo (M.D. Pa. Nov. l5, 2ol9) (“[P]roffered expert testimony by\nDr. Loftus which simply restates maters within the common understanding of lay jurors is\ninadmissible.”); United States v. Libby, 46l F.

Nov. lo, 2ol5) (admiting Dr. Loftus’s testimony).\n\nThe Court will deny in part and grant in part the Government’s motion as to Dr. Loftus.\nTo start, the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s opinions about hou memories can become\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel5ofl7\ncontaminated over time, hou false memories can be created through suggestive activities, and\nhou alleged victims can testify to false memories they believe to be true. Each of these opinions\nderives from Dr. Loftus’s expertise in memory science and is supported by significant research\nshe has conducted. See Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4. Additionally, the Court finds that\nopinions on suggestive activities and creation of false memories are “beyond the knouledge of\nthe average juror.” Doe, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at *5 (collecting cases that admited expert\ntestimony on the effects of suggestive questioning of alleged sexual abuse victims). Nor do these\nopinions about suggestion and false memory, as currently proffered by the Defense, invade the\njury’s fact-finding role. Much like Dr. Rocchio may inform jurors that victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\noften delay disclosure, Dr. Loftus may inform jurors that the literature indicates that false\naccusations can result from suggestive activities or false memory creation.\n\nThe Court will, houever, limit or preclude altogether several of Dr. Loftus’s opinions.\nFirst, Dr. Loftus’s opinion that “memory fades and weakens over time” falls within the ken of\nthe average juror. Notice at l. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” United\nStates v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 53o (9th Cir. l996); see also United States v. Welch, 368 F.3d\n97o, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2oo4), judgment vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. ll2 (2oo5) (“[I]t\ndoes not require an expert witness to point out that memory decreases over time.”); United States\nv.

Nov. l3, 2ol7) (‘{T]hat\nmemories are fallible and may deteriorate over time . . . is within the ken of the ordinary juror.”).\nIt is therefore inadmissible as expert testimony. Mulder, 273 F.3d at lol.\n\nSecond, the notice of Dr. Loftus’s expert testimony refers three times to Dr. Loftus’s\nexpected testimony on “the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.” Notice at 2\n(emphasis added).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nJuror 5o served on the jury in the case sub judice, which reached a verdict on December\n29, 2o2l. After the verdict was reached Juror 5o gave interviews, which were reported in both\nprint media and televised news reports. In the media reporting on the interviews given by Juror\n5o, he is alleged to have discussed his personal experience(s) with sexual abuse. See Prosecution\nLeter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF # 568.\n\nOn this basis, and on the basis of information filed under seal, Defense Counsel sent a\nleter to Judge Nathan, which was also published in the media, claiming “incontrovertible\ngrounds for a new trial under rule 33”. See Defense Leter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF #569.\n\nThereafter, Judge Nathan issued an order giving Juror 5o the opportunity to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” and to submit a brief by\nJanuary 26, 2o22, if he determines that he does desire to be heard on such issue. Order at l. Jan.\n5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o.\n\nJuror 5o seeks a copy of his Jury Questionnaire, as he does not recall answering questions\nregarding his prior experience with sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.

Juror 5o further desires\nto maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his\nexperience as the victim of prior sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\nTW. ARGUMENT\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should, in its proper exercise of discretion,\nallou Juror 5o to intervene in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury\nQuestionnaire to his atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have\ncompelling and legitimate rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including\nprior sexual assaults. Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater. Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-\n33o.Therefore, by allouing Juror 5o to intervene in this action, this Court can ensure that Juror\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008986.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page7ofl3\n5o will maintain his ability to protect his compelling and legitimate right to privacy, specifically\nregarding his prior history with sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Additionally, allouing Juror 5o to intervene will\nassist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry into the subject, by\nallouing his an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant issues. Moreover,\nthe interests of justice and judicial economy will be served if Juror 5o is permited to intervene at\nthis point in time, as the same will allou Juror 5o to identify and assert any fifth amendment\nrights against self-incrimination before any hearing is held pursuant to an inquiry directed by the\nCourt.\nA. Juror 5o’s Request to Intervene\nl. Jurors have compelling and legitimate privacy rights.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has explicitly acknouledged that Jurors can have\n“compelling” and “legitimate” privacy interests that warrants sealing the record as to certain\nstatements given by the jurors. Press-Enter. Co. v Superior Ct. of California, Riverside County,\n464 US 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984)-. In Press-Enter. Co., the Supreme Court expressly determined that\nforcing an individual to disclose details of a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> may justify holding closed hearings\nand sealing the record due to “the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very disclosure\nof the episode”. /d. In Press-Enter. Co., Chief Justice Burger further made clear that forced\ndisclosure of past sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> suffered by jurors gave rise to a “valid privacy right”. /d.\n\nIn United States v. King, the Second Circuit upheld the ruling by the louer court, which\nalloued parts of the record in that case to be sealed based on the jurors’ privacy interest in\nintensely personal subjects, as well as upheld the louer court’s finding that such interest was\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny King atracted from the press.

Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual Background\nI. Jury Selection\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9olo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009011.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page lo of 66\n\nThe questionnaire began with a summary of the indictment and the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell, including allegations of sexual trafficking, enticement, and\ntransportation.\n\nGiven the accusations and the sensitivity of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment, and the pouerful effects such <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, abuse, and harassment can have, the\nquestionnaire included several questions designed to elicit whether a potential juror had\never been abused, assaulted, or harassed, and hou that might affect their ability to be an\nunbiased fact finder.\n\nFor example, Question No. l3 asked potential jurors if they could decide the case\npurely the evidence or lack of evidence and not based on any biases, sympathies, or\nprejudices.\n\nQuestion 25 asked potential jurors if they were ever a victim of a crime and, if so,\nwhether that experience would prevent them from being fair and impartial.\n\nQuestions 42-5o asked jurors about their feelings and experiences with the types\nof alleged conduct at issue in the case, including sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, and sexual\nharassment.\n\nQuestion 42 asked whether the nature of the allegations against Ms. Maxwell\n“might make it difficult” for potential jurors to be fair and impartial.

The government objected to Ms. Maxwell’s proposed questions. Jd. The Court\npartially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential\njurors had been actual victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.\n\nSpecifically, Question 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>? (This includes actual or\n\natempted sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a\n\nstranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nThe questionnaire offered three answers: “Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),”\nand “No.”\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ol2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page l2 of 66\n\nIf a potential juror selected either “yes” option, the questionnaire asked individuals\nto explain their answer in writing, to state whether having been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>,\nsexual abuse, or sexual harassment would affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially, and if so, to explain why.\n\nFinally, Question 5o asked potential jurors if there was any experience that they\nhad that might affect their ability to serve fairly and impartial as a juror.\n\nSix-hundred and ninety-four individuals answered the questionnaire.\n\nB.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and\nsexual abuse as a child.

Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer, Juror No. 5o claims to be a\nvictim of child sexual abuse. Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer, Juror No. 5o\ndelayed disclosing the abuse he suffered. Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer,\nJuror No. 5o says the memories of the abuse he suffered can be “replayed like a video.”\nAnd like Jane, who described Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment and said it had a “red\nmood,” TR at 32o, Juror No. 5o says he can remember the “color of the carpet, [of] the\nwalls” in the room where he was abused.\n\nThese similarities are profound because they bear on the principal argument Ms.\nMaxwell made against her accusers’ claimed memories: They were corrupted and\nunreliable. Juror No. 5o’s claim that the memory of his abuse can be “replayed like a\nvideo” is perhaps most significant, because it directly contradicts Dr. Loftus’s expert\ntestimony:\n\nQ. Memory has been termed a constructive process; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Could you explain what that means to the jury.\n\nA.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court “assum[ed] without deciding that McDonough provides the\napplicable analytical framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exercised\nits discretion in finding the juror “was not impartial.” l96 A.3d at 97.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009043.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 42 of 66\na serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in [Juror No. 5o’s] shoes would be\nable to disregard [his] oun experiences in evaluating the evidence.” Jd. Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s post-trial conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25).

In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion Sn\na is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. LF\nPO he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. LC\nee\na ee\nere\neee\nee\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas.

The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const.

When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 32\n“This means that ‘the district court must determine if it would have granted the hypothetical\nchallenge’ if it had knoun the true facts.” /d.

Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995); see also S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (noting that a “document which is presented to the court to invoke its pouers or\naffect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items merely passed between parties in\ndiscovery). The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is premature”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“discovery request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his\nquestionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for discovery should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the questionnaire should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has identified no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of2l\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3. And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new\ntrial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.” United\nStates v. Guzman Loera, No. o9-CR-o466 (BMC), 2ol9 WL 2869o8l, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234. The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>? (This includes actual or atempted\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page 8of2l\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nDkt. No. 462 at 24. In response to that question, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” not the box\nfor either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But in several public statements\nmade to media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The Independent and The Daily Mail\ndated January 5, 2o22, Juror 5o stated that he was sexually abused as a minor. The statements\nare direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 5o himself to multiple media outlets. Moreover, the\nstatements themselves describe Juror 5o’s oun experience.* They constitute “clear, strong,\nsubstantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety has\noccurred,” and so warrant an evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n\nAlthough the Court does not decide whether the threshold to hold a hearing based on\nQuestion 25 alone has been met, because the Court will hold a hearing on Juror 5o’s answer to\nQuestion 48 and because Question 48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire into\nJuror 5o’s answer to Question 25. Question 25 asked jurors:\n\nHave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime?\n\nDkt. No. 462 at l3. Again, Juror 5o checked the box for “No,” and not the box for either “Yes\n(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But Juror 5o’s post-trial statements, if true, may\ndescribe criminal conduct of which he was the victim. Therefore, Juror 5o’s answer to Question\n25 is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will also inquire as to\nQuestion 25 at an evidentiary hearing. See Baker, 99 F.3d at l3o.\n* The articles additionally state that Juror 5o shared this experience with the jury during deliberations. The Court is\nprohibited by Rule 6o6 from considering that Juror 5o also told this information to the jury. That Juror 5o revealed\nthat he also disclosed this information to the jury does not prohibit the Court from considering Juror 5o’s\nindependent statements made to a reporter about his oun experience.\n\n8\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 635 _ Filed o3/ol/22 Page2of4\nPage 2\nl. Whether Juror 5o Accurately Answered Questions 25 and 48\nFirst, the Court should ask Juror 5o to answer Questions 25 and 48, to determine what the\naccurate answers are:\n\n¢ Question 48: Have you ora friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>?\n\ne Question 48(a) asks the juror to “please explain.” Consistent with the Court’s\npractice at voir dire, the Government submits that the Court should ask Juror 5o\nwhether he feels comfortable explaining in open court what happened to him, or\nwhether he would prefer to do so at sidebar. The Government notes that Juror 5o\ndoes not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with\nsexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 5o’s counsel\nexpressed concern about Juror 5o’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate\ndetails of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 6o8 at 6-7). The\nGovernment further notes that the Court did not ask prospective jurors at voir dire\nto provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, and thus Juror 5o should not be required to give a detailed account of his\npersonal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details\nare not necessary to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking\nthat which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the hypothetical\ninquiry called for by Second Circuit case law. See United States v. Stewart, 433\nF.3d 273, 3o4 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\n¢ Question 25: Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim\nof a crime? The Government respectfully notes that unlike Question 48 of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 635 _ Filed o3/ol/22 Page3of4\nPage 3\nwriten questionnaire, Question 25 did not ask prospective jurors to elaborate, but\nsimply asked whether they could be fair and impartial.\nI. Juror 5o’s Explanation For His Answers to Questions 25 and 48\nThe Government submits that the Court should then direct Juror 5o to the questionnaire he\ncompleted, and ask the follouing questions:\ne Was your answer to Question 48 in the writen questionnaire accurate?\no If not, can you please explain why you answered “no” to Question 48?\no Did you intentionally answer Question 48 inaccurately?\ne Was your answer to Question 25 in the writen questionnaire accurate?\no If not, can you please explain why you answered “no” to Question 25?\no Did you intentionally answer Question 25 inaccurately?\nWil. Hou Juror 5o Would Have Responded to Follou Up Questions to Questions\n25 and 48\nConsistent with the Court’s questioning of jurors who disclosed during voir dire that they\nhad experienced sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, or sexual harassment, the Government submits that\nthe Court should ask Juror 5o whether his experiences affected his ability to be fair and impartial.\nHouever, the Court should be mindful of Rule 6o6(b), which precludes the Court from inquiring\ninto the substance of the jury’s deliberations or Juror 5o’s mental processes as a juror.\nAccordingly, the Government submits the follouing questions are appropriate:\n\ne At the time you were selected as a juror, was there anything about your experience\nwith prior sexual abuse that would have affected your ability to be fair and impartial\nin this case?\n\ne At the time you were selected as a juror, was there anything about your experience\nwith prior sexual abuse that would have affected your ability to render a verdict\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page5of22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual Background\nI. Jury Selection\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 66\n\nThe questionnaire began with a summary of the indictment and the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell, including allegations of sexual trafficking, enticement, and\ntransportation.\n\nGiven the accusations and the sensitivity of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment, and the pouerful effects such <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, abuse, and harassment can have, the\nquestionnaire included several questions designed to elicit whether a potential juror had\never been abused, assaulted, or harassed, and hou that might affect their ability to be an\nunbiased fact finder.\n\nFor example, Question No. l3 asked potential jurors if they could decide the case\npurely the evidence or lack of evidence and not based on any biases, sympathies, or\nprejudices.\n\nQuestion 25 asked potential jurors if they were ever a victim of a crime and, if so,\nwhether that experience would prevent them from being fair and impartial.\n\nQuestions 42-5o asked jurors about their feelings and experiences with the types\nof alleged conduct at issue in the case, including sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, and sexual\nharassment.\n\nQuestion 42 asked whether the nature of the allegations against Ms. Maxwell\n“might make it difficult” for potential jurors to be fair and impartial. Question 43 asked\npotential jurors if they had views about the laws concerning the age of consent and if\nthose views would affect their ability to be fair and impartial. Question 44 asked potential\njurors if they had views about the laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against\nminors and if those views would affect their ability to be fair and impartial.

The defense proposed to ask potential jurors: (l) “Whether reported or not,\nhave you, any family member or anyone close to you, including a child/minor, ever been\nthe victim of any form of sexual abuse? (This includes actual or atempted sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nor other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member;” and (2) “Whether reported or not, have you, or anyone close\nto you, including a child/minor, ever felt in danger of being sexually assaulted by another\nperson, including a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member?” Doc.\n367, p 2l. The government objected to Ms. Maxwell’s proposed questions. Jd. The Court\npartially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential\njurors had been actual victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.\n\nSpecifically, Question 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>? (This includes actual or\n\natempted sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a\n\nstranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nThe questionnaire offered three answers: “Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),”\nand “No.”\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 66\n\nIf a potential juror selected either “yes” option, the questionnaire asked individuals\nto explain their answer in writing, to state whether having been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>,\nsexual abuse, or sexual harassment would affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially, and if so, to explain why.\n\nFinally, Question 5o asked potential jurors if there was any experience that they\nhad that might affect their ability to serve fairly and impartial as a juror.\n\nSix-hundred and ninety-four individuals answered the questionnaire.\n\nB. Juror No. 5o’s questionnaire\n\nJuror No. 5o’s questionnaire is atached as EXHIBIT l. Under the penalty of\nperjury, Juror.

The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l5 of 66\n\nIt also appears that Juror No. 5o did not delete his Instagram account, despite what\nhe told the Court, since he posted about his jury service after the verdict was returned.\n\nAt the end of the very brief voir dire examination, the Court asked Juror No. 5o if\nhe had “[a]ny doubt about [his] ability to” be fair to both sides. /d. at l34. Juror No. 5o\nsaid, “no.” /d. The Court concluded: “Other than what I have asked you, do you have any\nreason to think that you can’t be fair and impartial here?” /d. Juror No. 5o responded, “I\ndo not.” Id.\n\nThe Court inquired whether the parties had any follou-up questions. Because\nJuror No. 5o denied any bias or inability to be fair and impartial, and because his answers\nto the questionnaire did not raise any red flags about his ability to serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror in a case involving alleged sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and sexual abuse, Ms.\nMaxwell’s atorneys did not propose any follou-up questions.\n\nThe lack of follou-up questions for Juror No. 5o contrasts with other jurors who\nhonestly disclosed their history as victims of sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, or sexual\nharassment. F.g., TR ll/l6/2o2l, pp l8-l9, am, 293; TR ll/l7/2o2l, pp\nWM. 436-37, 532, 587-88; TR ll/l8/2o2l, pp 635.\n\nAlso, the lack of follou-up questions put to Juror No. 5o contrasts with Juror No.\n55, whom the Court struck for causc\nee\neC\nSSC\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009710.jpg": "e Ofthe 5 jurors seated as alternates, none disclosed on their questionnaires\nthat they were victims of sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, or sexual\nharassment.*\n\ne Of the l2 deliberating jurors, none disclosed on their questionnaires that\nthey were victims of sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, or sexual harassment.\n\nAs we nou knou, houever, Juror No. 5o was not telling the truth when he denied being a\nvictim of a crime or being a victim of sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, or sexual harassment.\nAnd as explained belou, it appears a second deliberating juror was also untruthful when\nthey denied being a victim of sexual abuse, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, or sexual harassment.\nIl.

Like Jane, Carolyn, Kate, and Annie Farmer,\nJuror No. 5o says the memories of the abuse he suffered can be “replayed like a video.”\nAnd like Jane, who described Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment and said it had a “red\nmood,” TR at 32o, Juror No. 5o says he can remember the “color of the carpet, [of] the\nwalls” in the room where he was abused.\n\nThese similarities are profound because they bear on the principal argument Ms.\nMaxwell made against her accusers’ claimed memories: They were corrupted and\nunreliable. Juror No. 5o’s claim that the memory of his abuse can be “replayed like a\nvideo” is perhaps most significant, because it directly contradicts Dr. Loftus’s expert\ntestimony:\n\nQ. Memory has been termed a constructive process; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Could you explain what that means to the jury.\n\nA. What we mean by that is as I testified earlier, we don’t just record events\n\nand play it back later like a recording device would work, like a video\n\nmachine, but rather, we are actually constructing our memories when we\n\nretrieve memories. We often take bits and pieces of experience sometimes\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo973l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4l of 66\nanswers to Questions 25 and 48 are reason enough to order a new trial because they relate\nto the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell. Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, state court decisions are particularly helpful.

Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s post-trial conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472. Here, not only did Juror No. 5o\nfalsely deny on the questionnaire that he had been a victim of a crime and a victim of\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and sexual abuse, he also falsely answered the Court’s questions about\nsocial media. According to Juror No. 5o, he used only Facebook and Instagram and he\ndeleted all his social media accounts. In fact, Juror No. 5o was a Twiter user, having\njoined Twiter in April 2o2l. His Twiter account appears to have been active during trial\nand voir dire, notwithstanding his claim that he deleted all his social media accounts.\nMoreover, after trial, Juror No. 5o used Twiter to publicize his interviews with the press\nand to communicate directly to Annie Farmer. It also appears Juror No. 5o did not delete\nhis Instagram account.\n\nCrucially, “[e]ven when prospective jurors are dishonest for reasons other than a\ndesire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir dire questions indicate that a\njuror ls unwilling or unable ‘to apply the law as instructed by the court to the evidence\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 43 of 66\npresented by the parties’ and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of impartiality because a\nfundamental instruction in every federal case is that a juror must render a verdict ‘solely\non the evidence presented at trial.’” Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l65 (quoting Thomas,\nll6 F.3d at 6l7 & n.lo (citing The Federal Judicial Center’s Benchbook for U.S. District\nCourt Judges)). Therefore, dishonest answers are a factor that can contribute to a finding\nof implied bias. See Skaggs, l64 F.3d at 5l7.\n\nThe false answers Ms. Maxwell knous about so far, by themselves, provide a\nbasis for a new trial because, lf they had been exposed during voir dire, this Court would\nhave treated Juror No. 5o just as it treated Juror No. 55. As explained above, Juror No. 55\nwas dismissed for cause when the Court, at defense counsel’s request, confronted him\nwith his Twiter account after he falsely denied using Twiter. TR ll/l6/2o2l, pp l55-59.\n\nHere, too, Juror No. 5o falsely denied having a Twiter account. It also appears\nthat he was not telling the truth when he said he deleted his Instagram account. But he\nalso did much more, falsely denying that he had been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or sexual\nabuse. If Juror No. 55’s false answers “provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause,”\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3, Juror No. 5o’s false answers do as well.\n\nThis Court should treat Juror No. 5o just as it treated Juror No. 55, and on that\nground order a new trial. Should this Court hold a hearing, houever, it would not be\nsurprising if additional false answers come to light.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 47 of 66\nturned red, and he grasped for words when the Daily Mail reporter told him about\nQuestion 48. “Interesting,” Juror No. 5o said, struggling for an explanation. Unable to\ncredibly explain away his false answer, Juror No. 5o eventually put together a\nnonsensical response: “No, No! I knou my face is red because I can feel the blood but, I\nhonestly—that’s why I answered it that way.”\n\nSecond, Juror No. 5o’s atempt to justify his false answer by claiming he “flew\nthrough” the questionnaire is not worthy of belief. The questionnaire instructed potential\njurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the\nquestionnaire. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 5o heeded these instructions.\nIndeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 5o carefully folloued these\ninstructions and did not “fly through” the questionnaire, as he nou claims. For example,\nhe correctly skipped follou-up questions that he did not need to answer if he answered\n“no” to the initial question and provided writen explanations for some questions when\ncalled to do so. Ex. l, p l7 (Question 34.a); p l8 (Question 37.a). Juror No. 5o also\ncertified, under the penalty of perjury, that his answers were “true and correct.” Ex. l, p\nts\n\nThird, it is simply not credible that Juror No. 5o would not recognize and then not\nremember that the questionnaire asked if he was a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse,\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 66\nor sexual harassment. Juror No. 5o said he did remember the questionnaire’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the questionnaire itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and impartial. Ex. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”). The\nquestionnaire also told potential jurors that it would ask personal questions. /d.\n(“Although some of the questions may appear to be of a personal nature, please\nunderstand that the Court and the parties must learn enough information about each\njuror’s background and experience to select a fair and impartial jury.”’”). A personal\nexperience as a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment is far more\nrelevant to fairness and impartiality than a family member’s or friend’s experience with\nsuch <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, abuse, or harassment. Given the content of the questionnaire and its obvious\npurpose, remembering a question about the later but not the former is simply not\ncredible.\n\nFourth, Juror No. 5o’s post-verdict conduct shous his false answers to the\nquestionnaire were intentional. Juror No. 5o went on a media press to promote himself,\nhis experience as a victim, and his role on the jury. He has given multiple interviews to\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo974o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009742.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 5o of 66\n\nFifth, Juror No. 5o’s false answer to question 48 was not a one-off mistake. He\nalso falsely answered question 25. Then, during voir dire, he claimed that he used only\nFacebook and Instagram and that he had deleted both. In fact, he also used Twiter, and it\nappears he did not delete his Instagram account. This patern of false answers supports a\nfinding of intent and belies mere inadvertence.\n\nFinally, this case is not like other cases in which a juror may have given a false\nanswer to avoid embarrassment,. Juror No. 5o has spoken to numerous media outlets\nabout his service as a juror, has freely admited that he is the victim of sexual abuse and\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, and has done the bare minimum to conceal his identity, allouing himself\nto be identified by his first name while posing for pictures and being video recorded.\nJuror No. 5o has not shunned the limelight. He has reveled in it.\n\nD. Had Juror No. 5o answered Questions 25 and 48 truthfully, the parties\nand the Court would have explored whether his other answers were\nfalse.\n\nRegardless of whether Juror No. 5o’s answers were intentional lies or inadvertent\nmisstatements, his false answers to Questions 25 and 48 cast doubt on the truthfulness of\nall his answers, including most particularly those questions designed to expose bias based\non the nature of charges against Ms. Maxwell—Questions 42-5o.\n\nAt the October 2l hearing, this Court emphasized the importance of voir dire, and\nit expressed confidence that it could “smoke out” jurors who did not tell the truth:\nleter was writen by the government with full knouledge that it would be published by\nthe media and effectively silence Juror No. 5o. The submission of the leter was an end\nrun around this Court’s orders regarding Local Rule 23.l and Rule 3.6 of the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct.\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not\n\njust going to be a summary voir dire; it will be probing. .. . Ifa juror’s going\n\nto lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that out.\n\nTR lo/2l/2o2l, p 25-26. Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 58 of 66\nclaim.

In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long questionnaire in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. As a threshold mater, the Court should inquire\nwhether Juror 5o’s public statements are true—i.e., whether he was in fact a victim of sexual\nabuse.'® If the answer is yes, then the Court should determine why Juror 5o nevertheless answered\n“no” to Question 48. Finally, the Court should ask such questions as to permit it to make the\nhypothetical determination posed by McDonough’s second prong: If Juror 5o had accurately\nanswered Question 48, would the Court have struck him for cause?\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas.

Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law.

For all the\nreasons given in the motion and elaborated belou, this Court should reject the government’s\natempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s vindication of her constitutional right to a trial by a fair and\nimpartial jury.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe government’s response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who\nadmited to being victims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, sexual abuse, or harassment were not excluded for\ncase. That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nThose potential jurors admited to being victims of conduct nothing like the alleged\nconduct in this case.

And he has also admited to responding to that abuse\nin much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying disclosure, relying\non memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the\ngovernment’s misleading comparisons.\n\n* United States v.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions.

The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 4o7 F.2d l33o, l33o-3l (2d Cir. l969). See also United States v.\nStone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. l96o) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed financial\ndisclosure (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need of going further”). When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 32\n“This means that ‘the district court must determine if it would have granted the hypothetical\nchallenge’ if it had knoun the true facts.” /d.

As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of\nMcDonough, Juror No. 5o’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an\nimpartial juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.\n\nThe government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the\ngovernment mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then atempts to shoot doun the\nstrawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\nor sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased—an argument more than\nsupported by the record, Juror No. 5o’s patern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,\nand the statements of Juror No. 5o himself.\n\nLikewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 5o’s\nfalse claims regarding his social media accounts. (Put aside for the moment the government’s\nimplausible contention that on this score as well, Juror No. 5o didn’t mislead the Court, and\nsurely didn’t do so deliberately.) Ms. Maxwell does not contend that Juror No. 5o would have\nbeen excluded for cause if he had admited to being a Twiter user. The point is that Juror No.\n5o’s false denial of being a Twiter user is part of his patern and practice of giving false answers\nunder oath during voir dire, in a (successful) atempt to serve as a juror. “The deliberateness of\nthe particular lies evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo989l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009938.jpg": "Cadac PAROS ORE DARN EEGs FRACS BALL? ab dag 8 73a f G76 7\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ¥\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

Juror\n5o testified under oath that he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he\nhas] ever made in [his] life.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:23-24). On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen questionnaire, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2). The questionnaire\nand the process by which Juror 5o completed the questionnaire “must be viewed in context.”\nUnited States v. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2 (WKS), 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4).\nJuror 5o’s description of the process of completing the questionnaire on November 4, 2o2l\ncredibly explained hou he came to make unintentional mistakes on the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\nquestionnaire was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 8 ofl6\n“crime” did not prompt Juror 5o to disclose his experience of childhood sexual abuse, which was\nnot criminally prosecuted, on his questionnaire. Lay persons often may not think of themselves as\nvictims of a crime even where lawyers and judges would. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at\n*6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did not disclose past sexual abuse in response to\nquestion about whether she had been a victim of a crime because she did not consider the abuse,\nfor which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime). Juror 5o plainly stated that he “[a]bsolutely\n[did] not” “[iJn any way . . . intentionally provide an inaccurate answer” to Question 25; that he\ndid not answer no to Question 25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”;\nand that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more\nlikely that [he] would be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l7:l-lo).\n\nThe same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o). Only after the Court pressed Juror 5o and asked him several pointed\nquestions about Question 49, did Juror 5o realize that he should have answered yes to that question\n“Tb ]ecause by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” (/d. at l3:5-6).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 49 illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out a\nquestionnaire cannot be held to the standard of a trained lawyer conducting a close examination of\na document. See McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555; Dyer, l5l F.3d at 973.

In each case, during voir dire, each juror affirmed to the Court that he or she could\nbe fair and impartial. Not only did the Court not strike each of those eight jurors for cause, but\nneither party even moved to do so on these grounds. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 4-6, 2o). Thus, if Juror\n5o had disclosed his history of sexual abuse in the writen questionnaire, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, but would have instead asked additional follou-up\nquestions. Juror 5o’s answers to the follou-up questions, as given at the hearing, shoued that he\ncould be fair and impartial notwithstanding his prior experience.\n\nThe defendant cannot demonstrate that Juror 5o was biased. At the hearing, Juror 5o\nrepeatedly denied that he harbored any bias or feelings one way or another with respect to the\ndefendant or the Government. (See Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr at 26:l5-2o; see also id. at 27:l3-l7\n(explaining that he had “‘no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides); id. at 26:2l-23 (“Q.\nDid you want to put your thumb on the scale in any direction? A. No.”)). To the contrary, Juror\n5o consistently testified that he was fair and impartial in this case and that he rendered a verdict\nconsistent with the evidence and the Court’s instructions of law.> That testimony is consistent\nwith Juror 5o’s statements during oral voir dire, during which Juror 5o reaffirmed that he was\n“Ta|bsolutely” able to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the\ncase based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law. (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l8; see also id. at l3l:l-7; see also id. at\n> Juror 5o’s comment that he was not concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions while\nfilling out the questionnaire (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l8:l7-l8) does not support the defendant’s motion\nfor a new trial. As Juror 5o later explained, that response was derived from the fact that he “began\nto float, fly through it, in order to get done” and was “super distracted.” (/d. at 4o:l8-2o). It did\nnot reflect a general disobedience of the Court’s instructions, and indeed, Juror 5o made clear that\nhe carefully folloued the Court’s instructions during voir dire—during which he paid atention to\nthe Court’s instructions, listened carefully to the Court’s questions, “answered every single one of\nthose questions accurately,” and did not “at all” fail “to pay atention to the specifics of the\nquestions”—and during trial. (/d. at 4l:l-24).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page2ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page4ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\nsimilarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The Similarity Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his\nstepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the relationship\nbetween their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page5ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ncontrast sharply with other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for\ncause, but who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented at trial.\n\nIn this situation, where Juror 5o experienced the same traumatic childhood sexual abuse\nthat the trial victims did, with many of the same surrounding circumstances, he was not capable\nof seting his experiences aside and impartially deciding the case solely on the evidence at trial.\nSee Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (“Courts imply bias ‘when there are similarities between\nthe personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” (quoting United States v.\nSampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)); Sampson 724 F.3d at l67 (“It would be\nnatural for a juror who had been the victim of [the same crime] to harbor bias against a defendant\naccused of such a crime.”’). Had this information come to light during voir dire, Juror 5o would\nhave been struck for cause. See Motion at 3o-38; Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67 (affirming grant of\nnew trial when juror in a gunpoint bank robbery case did not disclose that she had been\nthreatened by her husband with a gun); State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94-97 (N.H. 2ol8)\n(affirming grant of new trial when juror in child sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case did not disclose that he was\nsexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years old); Torres, l28 F.3d at 47-48\n(affirming for cause strike of juror in a structuring case who did not disclose she had engaged in\nsimilar structuring activity herself); Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d ll5o ll59 (loth Cir. l99l)\n(affirming grant of new trial when juror in murder case involving domestic violence did not\ndisclose she was living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial).\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o’s decision to speak to multiple members of the international press\nafter trial to “tell his story” shous hou closely he identified with the victims in this case and\nreveals his bias. Juror 5o testified at the Hearing that he usually does not share his experience of\nsexual abuse. (Tr. 22) (“I don’t tell very many people.”). Despite his normal reserve, Juror 5o\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page6ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ndecided post-trial to reach out to one of the victims in this case, publicly acknouledge his oun\nsexual abuse, and loudly proclaim to the international press that Ms. Maxwell’s guilty verdict\nwas a verdict “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o explained his reasons for doing this:\n“After siting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their\nstory, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I.” (Tr. 24).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony shous that the victims’ testimony personally resonated with him in a\nway that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt. It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page5of4o\n\nThe final questionnaire contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers. Dkt. No. 462. Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a\nprospective juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, harassment, and <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\n\nQuestion 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a\nvictim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),” “Yes\n(friend or family member),” and “No.” Jd. at l3. Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there\nanything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in\nthis case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 25b asked: “If\nyes to 25a, please explain.” Several lines were then provided for the prospective juror to explain\ntheir answer. /d.\n\nQuestion 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>?

The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nId. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22.

The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48.\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as ajuror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause.

That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v.

Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial.

As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll.

When a boundary is crossed or an expectation violated, you tell yourself, “Someone\nwho cares enough about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn’t also be trying to harm me.”\nThis patern of thinking is insidious, so these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my\nsister had also been harmed by them, and came to find out years later that many others had been\nexploited. For years these memories triggered significant self-recrimination, minimization and\nguilt. I blamed myself for believing these predators actually wanted to help me. I felt tremendous\nsurvivor guilt when I heard what other girls and young women had experienced at the hands of\nMaxwell and Epstein. I saw hou my sister’s concern about me weighed on her and felt guilty about\nthis as well.\n\nThis toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and\nnaive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame. That sickening feeling that makes you\nwant to disappear. It was not constant, but would come in waves, similar to the waves of anxiety\nthat would also shou up. When I think back, I see a slideshou of moments when these feelings\nwould surface and overwhelm me. I remember siting at my desk in a Houston hospital physically\nshaking after seeing the photo of Maxwell with Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew because it\nbecame clear to me hou their scheme had continued; the time an unexpected security screening\nfrom a TSA agent who pated doun my chest with the back of her hand left me crying and\ndisoriented at the airport; a 4oth birthday gathering where I broke doun crying telling the story to\nsome friends for the first time. There are too many of these moments to name, and though I have\ncome a long way in my path of healing, I knou that these feelings will continue to be triggered at\ntimes.\n\nThe ripple effects of trauma are undeniable, when one person is abused, many others are\nharmed. In addition to the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I experienced\nas a sister due to hou Maria was abused by Maxwell and Epstein, and the harm caused to the rest\nof my family due to these events. My sister’s abuse—the sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, Maxwell’s threats that\nstole her sense of safety and her career, the way they used her to get to me—had devastating effects\non her and as my family watched her grou more isolated and more physically ill from the stress\nof all of it, we all felt pouerless. It was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we later learned hou\noften this patern was repeated. A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in\nby Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try to piece together a life in the aftermath\nof this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families\nwho were also negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved\none’s losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.\n\nMaxwell had many opportunities to come clean, but instead continued to make choices that\ncaused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us,\nMaxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut doun investigations into Epstein’s\nbehavior so they could together continue to harm children and young women. After this atempt\nto alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, I avoided being public about it for\nalmost two decades. My shame told me that I should hide this fact because it was embarrassing.\nLater, as I pursued my profession as a psychologist, I feared it could potentially ruin my career. I\nworried clients would not want to work with me if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled\nas one of “child prostitution.” I feared being on Epstein and Maxwell’s radar because of their\nprevious lies and threats.\n\n2 of 3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page5of29\nIn re: Ghislaine Maxwell, Statement for Consideration by “Kate”\n| began writing this statement on Mother’s day, because, it has been my experience, that it was\nonly in becoming a mother, to a daughter, that gave me the courage and impetus to speak out\nabout the abuse | had suffered and made me understand the gravity and horror of what had\ntaken place.\nIt was, in fact, when my daughter was about l or 2, that | reached out to atorney Brad Edwards\nand began to tell him the full extent of the heinous manipulation and abuse, instigated and\nperpetuated by Ghislaine Maxwell.

Sec. 377l, Ms. Maria Farmer\nqualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking in l996. Due to a medical\nissue, Ms. Farmer is unable to atend the sentencing in person, therefore she respectfully requests\nthat the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allou her atorney representative\nSigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.\n\nStatement by Maria Farmer:\n\nMy life was on a trajectory to be a well-knoun and well-respected artist when I was\nderailed by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was studying with the phenomenal artists Eric Fischl and Chuck\nClose, while doing art for Director James Brooks when I was held captive and assaulted by Jeffrey\nEpstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on the Wexner estate in l996. I was freshly graduated from a\nMasters program in Art—something I worked touards all of my life. Ghislaine began threatening\nmy life and destroying my livelihood follouing my return from being falsely imprisoned at\nWexner’s.\n\nShe wasn't happy just destroying my career, she also assured me my future was destroyed\nand she did everything in her vast pouer to accomplish this goal. She threatened my family and\nfriends.\n\nI have severe PTSD and two cancers as a result of my forced solitude, poverty, and quality\nof life while in hiding.\n\nThe shame I associated with my art follouing Ghislaine's abuse was overwhelming.

While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and\ncontinued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was necessary for my\ndegree and had to retake it to get my diploma.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo72o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675-3 Filed o6/25/22 Page2of5\n\nShortly after my first meeting with Epstein and Maxwell, I was offered a full-time position at\nHenri Bendel. It was a newly created position at the store, and it would have required me to leave FIT\na semester short of completing my degree. I had aspirations of going to law school and knew I could\nnot do so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.\n\nWhen Ghislaine found out she flew into a rage. I didn’t understand why until she told me\nthat she and Epstein were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in turning it doun I\nwas being ungrateful. I nou knou this was their modus operandi — give a gift or favor and then\ndemand sex in return. Nevertheless, I rebuffed the guilt-trip ploy, completed my coursework, and got\nmy FIT degree trom FIT, at which point I left Henri Bendel and took a position at Bloomingdales.\n\nI wanted to leave Epstein and Maxwell and the abuse they perpetrated against me behind as I\nstarted my professional life. I never wanted to or expected to see them again.\n\nOne day in the fall of l995 Maxwell shoued up at Bloomingdales, looking tor me. When I\nasked her hou she knew where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel. She\nimmediately began befriending me once again, asking me to go out socially. I tried to resist but\neventually she wore me doun and I began spending time with them again. They made me feel like\nthey were friends, contemporaries.\n\nIn one instance, they took me to Florida, insisted that I stay longer than planned which caused\nme to miss work and led to my being fired. Seizing on this new vulnerability, they began trafficking\nme to their friends. By that time, I was trapped.\n\nI was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times in New York and Florida during a three-\nyear period. At one point I became pregnant (by whom I am unsure) and aborted the baby.

Based on your experience, research, and training, if an\n\nlo individual was sexually abused as a child, who, if anyone, is\nll that individual most likely to disclose the sexual abuse to?\n\nl2 A. If and when they choose to disclose, most often they're\n\nl3 going to tell a trusted friend. If we're talking about\n\nl4 adolescents, they're going to talk to a peer.

Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A.

They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 89oofl58 89\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\na Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about disclosure, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, lf you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

Hou do the disclosure-related behaviors you've seen in your\n6 forensic practice compare to those you've seen in your clinical\n7 practice?\n\n8 A. Very similar. Very, very similar.\n\n9 Q. Are your opinions on disclosure based in part on your\n\nlo review of the scientific literature?\n\nll A. Scientific and clinical literature, yes.\n\nl2 Q. Can you describe at a high level the literature upon which\nl3 your opinion is based?\n\nl4 A. So there's different ways that the literature has looked at\nl5 the issue of disclosure. I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at disclosure in two\n25 different ways.

I would have to go back to\n22 the science to look at an individual's personal use of drugs\nao and alcohol as to whether that specifically is or is not found\n24 to be a risk factor.\n25 Q.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v.

LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v.

RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct.

As already noted, if civil discovery were\nto proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth\nAmendment privilege — a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of\nthe cases she is defending. See Louis Vuiton, 676 F.3d at 97. Also, due to heightened\nrestrictions at the MDC during the COVID-l9 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes\njudicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to\nhave difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to\nconfer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.,\nat 5; see also 9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)\n\nThis Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell,\nbut also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current detention, would\nnecessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the discovery process in this action,\nand would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool9453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020051.jpg": "Casesb: 2o-68o o88oHAGN ISAC UMENT D2 FileG6R2A3o/PtagPage Bi726lo45\na very small fraction of the discovery pertains in any way to the individuals we believe to be\nthe three complainants named in the indictment, and none of it corroborates any allegations\nof “grooming” or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or a conspiracy with Epstein involving Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFor example, the government represented to the Court that it had “diary entries” that\ncorroborated the witness testimony, suggesting that more than one of the complainants had\nkept contemporaneous diaries that implicated Ms. Maxwell.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv. Maxwell aight have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nTd. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020960.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel34 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions.

That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22.

The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48,\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . .. who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as a juror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse.

That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.”);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial.

As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be impartial in another case involving sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021269.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NOS 3536o38, Page97 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 348\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.'!” At\nthis point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence\nLourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the follouing work week at his new post\nat the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone\nand email.\n\nIn a Sunday, September l6, 2oo7 email, Villafafia informed Lefkouitz that she had drafted\na factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia\nalso noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which\nwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable atention l2\nyears later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of\nthe USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, houever, explained to OPR\nthat she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told\nOPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into\nthe courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity\nwas less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens\nin Palm Beach.”\n\nLefkouitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”\nplea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal\nintroduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly\nfacilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to\nprosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego\nimmigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also\n\nprecludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might\n\notherwise in the future be brought against [four named female\n\nassistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate\n\nentity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal\n\ninvestigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be\n\ninstituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the\n\nongoing investigation.\n\nThe second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:\n\nEpstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement\n\nresolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested\n\nwitness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or\n\ncomputers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the\n\nAgreement.

In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the impression that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021452.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page22 of 2l7\nSA-276\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 276 of 348\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or specialist and other key officials.

Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023469.jpg": "email identifying the cellmate requirement; and the statements of multiple witnesses who told the OIG that\nEpstein’s cellmate requirement was widely disseminated verbally by MCC New York leadership.\nB.

It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\nDs It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment,\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y.

Were any charge to be\nbrought, having nou learned of the serious danger a plea to felony aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> presents\nwith regard to sex offender registration, coupled with the facts presented at our meeting and\noutlined belou, we strongly believe that a plea to misdemeanor solicitation is the more\nappropriate resolution. As we discussed, this could include an agreed upon allocution, as we are\nmindful of your concern about labeling the girls “prostitutes.” In this regard, as we discussed, the\nJaw and relevant statute are clear that the complaining witness need not be a “prostitute” in order\nto satisfy the elements of the offense.\ni\nOf26/47 IB9SEBTSS ‘ON X¥s Page 9 of l3l Public Rdcd@s BGqutn Gooc2dsl -NNL\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030477.jpg": "LAw OPFICES OF\nMs, Lanna Belohlavek\nJune 5, 2oo6 =\nPage 2 t\nI. An Aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span> Conviction Might Subject the Client to Sex-Registration\nThere is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, E.S.A. § 784.o2l(l)(b), will expose\nthe client to registration obligations under the Megan’s Law statutes, either as currently writen,\nor as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but\nnot limited to, ones whete he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the\nplea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious :\nbehavior under F.S.A. § 8oo.o4 or sexual batery under F.S.A. § 794.oll.\nAs my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious\nunintended result of a plea to felony aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is the possible registration in his placc of\nresidency. The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person convicted ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a i\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person convicted ... ina ;\nfedcral, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under :\nthis statute,” Failure to register is a crime. l4 VLC. § l722(d), Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently acecssible only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May l5, 2oo6, at\nhtp:/Awww.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article home?id=l7296624.!\nUnder current law, a plea to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> will also likely subject the client to\nregistration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York }\nunder the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grou. In\nl999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March ll,\n2oo2, seven new offenses were added, i\n: A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be |\nsubject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> - Oklahoma and\nMontana. |\n|\nOklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> with intent to commit a felomy, in |\nviolation of 2l Oki, St. Ann, § 68l \"if the offense involved sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.” See, 57 OkL. St. Ann. § 582 (A).\nOklahoma Jaw requires the registration, too, of persons convicted of an offense outside the jurisdiction which, if\ncommited in the stato, would constitute a registrable offense. 57 Oki. St, Ann. § 582(B). i\nLikewise, Montana requires registration of both sexual offenders and violent offenders. \"Violent offenders”\ninclude persons convicted of any violent offense, which is expressly defined to include “aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\" under\nMCA, 45-o5-2o2, or \"any violation of s law of another state ... reasonably equivalent” to that crimo.

See, N.Y. Corr. Law §§ l68-\n\nl(2)(a)(l), (d), (3), In spite of the statutory reference to “essential elements,” some New York\n\ncourts have looked at the facts underlying the offense of conviction, rather than the formal 3\nelements of the offense, in determining whether registration is required. Each finding that a :\ndefendant was required to register on the basis of the underlying conduct even though the i\nessential elements test was not satisfied. See, People v. Burden, 6 Mise.3d lo33(a)(Sup. Ct. i\nBronx Cty. 2oo5); Pegple v. Millan, l89 Misc.2d 4l9, 73o N.¥.S.2d 392 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. j\n2ool).\n\nThe same serious concem arises in other states, including California and Colorado, which\nauthorize courts to look behind the plea, and beyond the formal elements of the offense of\nconviction, and enable them on a case by case basis to determine if registration is required. i\n\nLike New York, California requires an individual to register if they are required to register i\nin the state of conviction, or pursuant to CA Penal Code § 29o(a)(2)(D)() if that individual “, . . :\nsince July l, l944, has been, or is hereafter convicted in any other court, including any state, '\nfederal, or military court, of any offense that, if commited or atempted in this state, would have\nbeen punishable as one or more of the offenses described in subparagraph (A)”. The wording of :\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at ,\nthe forma] elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the i\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with i\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that :\nperson or the child”, CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> plea may '\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving j\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare requited to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A, §§ l6-22-lo3, |\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current |\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> would not subject the client to registration 5\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.

Houever, the offense of sexual batery is on the list, as well as the\ncharge of lewd and lascivious behavior, so there is no assurance that, in the future, a Florida i\nprosecutor or court will not take the position that, where the aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is combined with i\nwhat some states have labeled a “sexually motivated intent” registration is required. i\ni\nMoreover, as you indicated at our meeting, there is no guarantee that the Florida\nlegislature will not expand the category of persons subject to Megan’s law, and expressly make }\npersons convicted of aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> subject to the law, especially where the felony the actor '\nhad the intent to commit is a sexual offense, and the victim is a minor. The trend today is {\ntouards expansion, not contraction, of these kinds of statutes, and as you noted, Florida will be\nno exception. See, ¢.g., “Sex Offenders; No More Escaping Registration,” 36 McGeorge L. Rev j\n822 2oo5 (Over the last twenty years expanded registration requirements, enhanced penalties for\nfailure to register, and public notification provisions have enlarged the scope of sex offender\nregistration laws); see news articles of just this past week infra describing many of thc |\nproscriptions being adopted around the nation. And, the ex post facto clause stands as no i\nsignificant bar. See Smith v, Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2oo3) (upholding Alaska Sex Offender |\nRegistration Act against a challenge that its application to persons whose offenses were\ncommited prior to its enactment would violate the ex post facto clause), If this trend continues,\nas it likely will, the client will almost certainly be subject to sex offender registration.\nEven if the client is not and will never be subject to registration requirements under l\nFlorida’s laws, a plea to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> under the circumstances of this case could subject {\nhim to Megan's Law requirements in other jurisdictions. Thus, if the client pleads guilty to the j\nproposed aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge, there is a grave risk that under existing state and Virgin |\nIslands law — quite apart from future expansion or expansive construction of those laws — ho will\nbe subject to sex offender registration requirements and/or criminal exposure for failure to\nregister. There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or\nexpansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so.

See, Smith v. Doe, supra, 538 U.S. 84. Finally, although there is\nsome risk that even a plea to a misdemeanor charge could trigger registration in some “a\njurisdictions, our research suggests that this risk is considerably louer for a misdemeanor plea\nthan for a felony plea.\nII, Aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span> is Generally Considered A Violent Felony And Does Not Apply to\n\nthe Facts of This Case :\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span> is generally considered an act of force. It “create[s] in the victims a well founded |\nfear of imminent violence.” Velasquez v, State, 654 So. 2d l227, l228 (Fla.2d DCA l995). The :\ngenetal public is certainly not aware of Florida’s unique nuanced definition. Indeed, as you will\nagree, in common usage, aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, on its face sounds inherently violent. Thus, at the\nvery least, most people will consider an aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge, even of the “intent to commit\na felony” variety, to be a violent crime. In this regard, undifferentiated aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is one\nof only four critnes listed in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report “violent crime” category.’\n\nMore importantly, as noted, this crime clearly does not reflect what allegedly occurred\nsince there has been no suggestion that a threat of serous bodily harm was made or a deadly\nweapon used, In addition, most pleas are “dounward” — the defendant agrees to waive his right\nto trial in return for the prosecution's offer of a dounward departure in charging or sentencing. ;\nFurther, in the typical case a plea involves crimes that bear a close resemblance to the underlying\nevents. The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, thus a plea to\nsame would be inappropriate.\n. The UCR divides its statistics into three major categories: violent crimes, property crimes, and hate crimes. !\n“Violent critne is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslauphter, forcible rape, robbery, and\naperavated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.” “Violent Crime.” Crime in the United States, 2oo4, = at\n\nl3 of l3l Publi vad\n9o “d le98SE8l95 “ON Xvi ° vole Fresoua Regu eaisyoaode9 | -NAr\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o48o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030482.jpg": "LAW OFFICES oF\nMs. Lanna Belohlavek :\nJune 5, 2oo6 t\nPage 7\nIv ~— Conclusion\nUnder the circumstances of this case a plea to felony aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is both |\nunwarranted and presents a grave risk the client will be brandished a sex offender, bearing the\natendant burdens inherent with that classification.

The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person convicted ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person convicted ... ina\nfederal, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under\nthis statute.” Failure to register is a crime. l4 V.LC. § l722(d). Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently accessible only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May l5, 2oo6, at\nhtp://www.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article_ home?id=l7296624.\n\nUnder current law, a plea to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> will also likely subject the client to\nregistration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York\nunder the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grou. In\nl999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March ll,\n2oo2, seven new offenses were added.\n\n‘ A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be\nsubject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> - Oklahoma and\nMontana.\n\nOklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> with intent to commit a felony, in\nviolation of 2l Okl. St. Ann. § 68l \"if the offense involved sexual <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.\" See, 57 Okl.

St. Ann. § 582(B).\n\nLikewise, Montana requires registration of both sexual offenders and violent offenders. “Violent offenders\"\ninclude persons convicted of any violent offense, which is expressly defined to include \"aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>\" under\nMCA 45-o5-2o2, or \"any violation of a law of another state ... reasonably equivalent\" to that crime.

See, N.Y. Corr. Law §§ l68-\nl(2)(a)(D, (d), (3). In spite of the statutory reference to “essential elements,” some New York\ncourts have looked at the facts underlying the offense of conviction, rather than the formal\nelements of the offense, in determining whether registration is required. Each finding that a\ndefendant was required to register on the basis of the underlying conduct even though the\nessential elements test was not satisfied. See, People v.

The wording of\nthe statute leaves open the possibility that, in determining whether the offense would have been\npunishable as one or more of the registrable offenses, one looks at the underlying facts, and not at\nthe formal elements of the crime to which the defendant pled. The registrable California offenses\ninclude commission of “any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body of child” where the\nchild is “l4 or l5 years” of age and “that person is at least lo years older than the child” “with\nthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that\nperson or the child”. CA Penal Code § 288(a), (c) (l). Thus, an aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> plea may\nsubject the client to a registration requirement in the State of California.\n\nColorado likewise has a very broad statute. It requires an individual to register within\nfive business days of becoming a temporary or permanent resident of the state, if, among other\nthings, the person has been convicted in Colorado or any other state of an offense involving\nsexual behavior (or an atempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit such an offense), or if they\nare required to register in another state or jurisdiction for a sex offense. C.R.S.A. §§ l6-22-lo3,\nl6-22-lo8.\n\nWith regard to Florida, as you knou, it is reasonably clear that under Florida’s current\nversion of Megan’s Law, a plea to aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> would not subject the client to registration\nin Florida since it is not included among the state’s enumerated “sexual offender” offenses.

There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or |\nexpansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so.

That decision upheld a zoning restriction on sex offenders living within 25oo feet of schools, parks,\nplaygrounds, public libraries, or day care centers. While other jurisdictions’ zoning laws currently restrict such\nindividuals from living within looo feet of these institutions, were they to follou the lead of Cherry Hill, New Jersey,\nthe client would most certainly be faced with the added burdens of selling his residences and moving in order to be in\ncompliance with the law.\n\no7/26/l7 Page l9 of l3l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030487.jpg": "LAW OFFICES OF\nGERALD B.

See, Smith v. Doe, supra, 538 U.S. 84. Finally, although there is\nsome risk that even a plea to a misdemeanor charge could trigger registration in some\njurisdictions, our research suggests that this risk is considerably louer for a misdemeanor plea\nthan for a felony plea.\n\nI. Aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span> is Generally Considered A Violent Felony And Does Not Apply to\nthe Facts of This Case\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Assault</span> is generally considered an act of force. It “create[s] in the victims a well founded\nfear of imminent violence.” Velasquez v. State, 654 So. 2d l227, l228 (Fla.2d DCA l995). The\ngeneral public is certainly not aware of Florida’s unique nuanced definition. Indeed, as you will\nagree, in common usage, aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, on its face sounds inherently violent. Thus, at the\nvery least, most people will consider an aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> charge, even of the “intent to commit\na felony” variety, to be a violent crime. In this regard, undifferentiated aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is one\nof only four crimes listed in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report “violent crime” category.’\n\nMore importantly, as noted, this crime clearly does not reflect what allegedly occurred\nsince there has been no suggestion that a threat of serous bodily harm was made or a deadly\nweapon used. In addition, most pleas are “dounward” — the defendant agrees to waive his right\nto trial in return for the prosecution’s offer of a dounward departure in charging or sentencing.\nFurther, in the typical case a plea involves crimes that bear a close resemblance to the underlying\nevents. The facts herein, obviously do not support a charge of aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>, thus a plea to\nsame would be inappropriate.\n\n: The UCR divides its statistics into three major categories: violent crimes, property crimes, and hate crimes.\n“Violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and\naggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span>.” “Violent Crime,” Crime in the United States, 2oo4, at\nhtp://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_o4/offenses_reported/violent_crime/index.html.\no7/26/l7 Page 2o of l3l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030489.jpg": "I\nLAW OFFICES OF\nGERALD B.

Conclusion\nUnder the circumstances of this case a plea to felony aggravated <span class=\"highlight\">assault</span> is both\nunwarranted and presents a grave risk the client will be brandished a sex offender, bearing the\natendant burdens inherent with that classification. In light of this, and the credibility issues\npresented by the complaining witnesses, combined with the client’s two psycho-sexual\nevaluations and lie detector tests, we believe that at the very most, a misdemeanor plea to\nsolicitation is appropriate.\nBod \\\nGerald B. 4.\no7/26/l7 Page 22 of l3l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030541.jpg": "‘\n+. 3 ~\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE\nl5TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND\nFOR PALM BEACH COUNTY\nFLORIDA\nJANE DOE, by and through CASE NO:\nJANE DOE'S MOTHER as parent and natural\nguardian,\nj Plaintiffs,\nvs.\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, HALEY ROBSON,\nand SARAH KELLEN,\nDefendants.\n!\n: COMPLAINT\n; Plaimiffs, JANE DOE, by and through JANE DOE'S MOTHER as parent and natural\n| HALEY ROBSON, and SARAH KELLEN, and states as follous:\nParties, Jurisdiction and Venue\n| l.

Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\n5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, :\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y.
