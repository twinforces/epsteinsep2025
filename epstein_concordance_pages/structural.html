This comment about Epstein’s distinct decorating style may seem implausible to jurors. But\nthe Government observed and photographed more than one stuffed animal that could fairly be\ndescribed as “creepy looking” during its search of Epstein’s house, including as depicted in\nGovernment Exhibit 9387:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe fact that this stuffed tiger is movable property is counterbalanced by the fact that it is\nhighly idiosyncratic. While the Government would not argue that Epstein had this particular\nstuffed tiger in his home in the mid-l99os, it is probative of Jane’s testimony that—at any point in\ntime—Epstein possessed the kind of “creepy looking animals” that she described.\n\nThird, the Government would offer six photos—Government Exhibits 9o9 through 9ll,\n9l3, 9l5, and 933—to demonstrate <span class=\"highlight\">structural</span> features of the house. Some of these photographs\nwill provide context for the law enforcement officer’s testimony by shouing the entrance areas of\nthe house which she searched.

The Government does not currently intend to offer exhibits depicting those photographs\nor artwork, but it does intend to elicit testimony from the law enforcement witness that the home\ncontained those items. That testimony is further corroboration of Jane’s general knouledge of\ncategories of decorations Epstein preferred, but it contains no suggestion that any particular exhibit\ncorroborates Jane’s testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defense has not raised a Rule 4o3 prejudice\nargument, and for good reason. None of the evidence in this category is prejudicial to the defense.\nThere will be no suggestion that the defendant or Epstein possessed these particular items during\nthe time period of the conspiracy, and the defense is free to argue that the distance in time\nundermines the probative force of the evidence. But whether that probative force is significant (as\nthe Government suggests) or minimal (as the defense suggests), the defense is not prejudiced by\npictures of a massager, a stuffed tiger, or photos of <span class=\"highlight\">structural</span> features of Epstein’s home.\n\nIl.

But there is no\ntestimony to support that argument, because Jane did not describe the vibrators other than to say\nthey were “different sizes.” TR ll/2o/2o2l, p 3lo:l4-l5.3 And because the government did not\nshou these photos to Jane, there is no evidence that they are “the type” she claims Mr. Epstein\nused on her. If they were “the type,” Jane could easily have said so on the stand.\n\nThe tiger next. Jane testified that Mr. Epstein had “animals” and “animal heads” and\n“strange things” in the house that were “a litle creepy personally.” /d. at 3l8:5-l3. She did not\ntestify or describe a tiger. There’s no foundation to admit that photograph, or the photograph of a\nstuffed dog, which Jane also did not describe. Gov.

Again, Ms. Maxwell does not challenge photos of the outside of Mr. Epstein’s\napartment. But photos of the inside of the apartment are a different mater.

Martinez-\nSalazar, 528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6-l7 (2ooo) (quoting Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966)).\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN IMPARTIAL JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth Amendment explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an impartial jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly difficult in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\nnecessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (plurality).\n\nHonesty is the heart of the jury-selection process in an adversarial system; indeed, “voir\ndire” means “to speak the truth.” The whole point of the voir dire process is to elicit\ninformation from the venire that may shed light on bias, prejudice, interest in the outcome,\ncompetence, and the like so that counsel and the parties may exercise their judgment\nabout whom to seat and whom to challenge.\n\nFields, 5o3 F.3d at 772. Just as judges must recuse themselves to protect the appearance of\n\nimpartiality, see Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 886 (2oo9), judges must\n\nensure that jurors, as judges of the facts, are also impartial in appearance as well as in reality.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9llo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the <span class=\"highlight\">structural</span> integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “<span class=\"highlight\">structural</span>” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page ll of 32\nchildhood sexual abuse; and (3) had he answered the questions accurately he would have been\nchallenged for cause and disqualified.\n\nThe Law\nI.

Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\nprospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors.

The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial.

The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nBinds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.\n\nEmbedded within Annabi’s canon of construction that prosecutors in one\ndistrict cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must\nbe a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention. Thus, if \"it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction,\"\nAnnabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.\nl986).\n\nThe language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which\n(l) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (Al78), (2)\ncontains a <span class=\"highlight\">structural</span> separation of this clause from the more restrictive language used\nelsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global”\nagreement. Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators\neasily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language. No\nsuch language was utilized and was, in fact, removed from the co-conspirator clause.\n\nA promise to bind other districts can be inferred from negotiations between a\ndefendant and a prosecutor.
