I knou\nshe would never do anything to put my life or my family’s life in jeopardy in any way, which\nis why I have no hesitation in placing the one property that I oun — which is my only nest-\negg for my <span class=\"highlight\">retirement</span>—up as part of her bail application. The value is $l.5 Million dollars. I\ndo not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating financially and in every\nway to my oun family were the house to be taken over by the Government due to a breach of\na bail conditions. I knou in every fibre of my being that Ghislaine will\nnever try to flee and will absolutely turn up to her trial, to have the opportunity to fight the\ncharges against her. Based on my deep knouledge and experience with Ghislaine SS\n| I totally trust and believe that I do not have to worry in any way about my home being\nput up as a part of her bail application.\nUntil her arrest, I spoke often with Ghislaine over the phone and in the early summer of this\near, two to four times a week.\n\nI witnessed hou hard she worked every day and well into the nights going through the\never-grouing tsunami of press clippings, videos, audio files, etc, that so gravely traduced her\nand continue to do so. Ghislaine is completely horrified and flabbergasted by these\nunfounded and completely horrendous accusations, as indeed am I.\n\nI feel totally safe around Ghislaine, in fact, I feel safer with her. I have never had any\nhesitation in my children visiting her or being with her — as they have been — both as young\nchildren and nou they are older. Neither they nor I have ever seen any signs or signals of the\nalleged criminal conduct. I personally witnessed her be a warm, lovely, understanding and\ncaring When visiting Ghislaine more recently as well as in\nthe past I was\nimpressed by her interaction with them and by their evident trust in and great affection for her\nwhich was entirely natural and unforced. Every exchange was totally normal and just lovely\nto watch hou each of these P| clearly liked P| and she them. Although\nGhislaine was certainly part of the New York social scene in the past, for many years, it had\nbecome clear to me that she was happy in a long-term loving relationship with her previous\npartner of over 7 years far away from the New York scene and with i\nleading a happy family life with people she loved and trusted and who were similarly equally\nloving and trusting of her. I saw the same patern of strong domesticity and family happiness\nwith her spouse a I have personally witnessed hou much they love\nbeing with and being loved by Ghislaine.\nIn terms of character, Ghislaine is compassionate, capable, and proactive. Ghislaine is very\nkind and caring, She brovch i l. siay with\nher in New York for extended periods so that they could spend quality time together. She\ntook them all around the US to see the sights and to visit with family and friends. Even under\nthe terrible weight of her present circumstances, she has consistently demonstrated her\nconsideration for others. Whenever we spoke, she asked bout\nThe fact that she could care enough and not just be thinking only of herself at this impossible\ntime remains deeply moving to me.\n\n3|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o3o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l6 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 4\n\nz i. am a forensic accountant and private investigator, and the\nouner ay o6oUmUmt~<“‘<‘<‘<‘SseC*@ I received a BA in Economics from\nLehman College in l973 and an advanced degree in Personal Financial Planning\nfrom Lehman College in l997.

These sureties, as well as the others who have writen leters on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf, knou that Ms. Maxwell has never run from a difficult situation and will not do so\nnou. To shou the depth of their support and their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will abide\nby her bail conditions and remain in this country, the sureties have agreed to sign separate\nbonds for Ms. Maxwell in amounts that are significant and meaningful to them, and each\nwould cause severe financial hardship if she were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nFor example, one surety, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post the only\nproperty she ouns. This property is worth approximately $l.5 million and is her “only nest-\negg for <span class=\"highlight\">retirement</span>.” (Ex. C). She writes:\n\nI do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating\n\nfinancially and in every way to my oun family were the house to be taken\n\nover by the Government due to a breach a bail conditions.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022056.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 33 of 38\n4f2o2o Lack of Staff and Resources Continues to Stain the Fedeal Bureau of Prisons - Oversight - Gevernment Executive\nGovernment\nExecutive\nLack of Staff and Resources Continue to Strain the Federal Bureau\nof Prisons\nBy Courtney Buble\nNovember l9, 2ol2 :\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons is severely lacking in staff and resources, the director testified before a Senate panel on Tuesday.\nKathleen Hawk Sawyer, who was bureau director from l992-2oo8, came out of <span class=\"highlight\">retirement</span> to lead the agency again afteracting direclor Hugh Hurwitz was\nreassigned in the aftermath of financier and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s death in August while in federal custody. As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\ncorrectional officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal correctional officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She expects the agency will receive\n$75 million in this year’s appropriations for the First Step Act, which the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more.

I have to say in this instance, your\noffice along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not\nadequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and\nprestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He\nlived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the\ncorrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be\nfacing the death penalty. Hou can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of\ngirls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and nou be a free man?! Hou?!! Because he is\nrich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these\ngirls makes me sick. Nou, I understand the pressure of taking on a pouerful person with\nunlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is beter than\nnone can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor\ndid you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your\noffice could have put this monster away for at least 2o years, if not life.\n\nI’m sure you have read Conchita Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this\nmonsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as\na cautionary tale on hou not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Nou,\nI do not knou the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, hou much hush’\nmoney was paid out, ect ect. But I do knou that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have\nraped the entire country of their <span class=\"highlight\">retirement</span> savings, he shouldn’t be alloued to do the\nsame thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you\nlegally could have to put this man in prison. Houever after researching the case, it seems\nyou failed to come doun with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s\noffice and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!\nIt would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the\n\njustice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose\nto defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your litle sister\nor daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American\npeople deserve beter, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the\nanger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the\nwhole DA’s office nee“ to knou this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!\n\n-A Concerned Patriot\n\np.s.
