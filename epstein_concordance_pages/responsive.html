When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC.

Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision.

On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001344.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo8aGAU Ant Boeument 72o FileaOVH26R o aPage ka 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she\nfurnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be\nmade in those maters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order\nto allou such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those maters. In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law. The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62 Filed ll/o8/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nfirst two conditions are reasonably related to the delayed production. The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices identified as <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein identified as <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool83o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74 Filed ll/23/2o Page 2 of 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review\nher discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before\nentering quarantine. The defendant will not, houever, be permited to meet in person with her\nlawyers until she tests out of quarantine.\n\nAfter the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the\nMDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day,\nthe defendant will be permited out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant\nwill have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during\nthe day, the defendant will be permited to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal\ncalls, access CorrLinks, and shouer. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation\ncell. The defendant will also be permited to have in-person visits with her atorneys up to three\ndays per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person\nlegal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day.\n\nAs was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her\ndiscovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as\nmuch, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys, even while\nin quarantine.\n\nAs noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated\nboth with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has\nimmediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the\nconcern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will\nremain <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant’s conditions of\nconfinement.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of l4\nSecretary of Labor.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003922.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 229 Filed o4/2l/2l Pagelof5\nU.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s Order dated\nApril l6, 2o2l, which directed the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all remaining pretrial\nmaters in the above-referenced case. (Dkt. No. 2o7). Although the parties have agreed upon a\nschedule for several pretrial maters, the parties have not reached complete agreement on a full\nschedule. Accordingly, the Government is submiting this leter containing its proposal, and\nunderstands that defense counsel will write separately to convey the defense’s competing proposal.\nBased on conversations with defense counsel, the Government understands that the parties\nagree on the follouing proposed dates, assuming trial begins as scheduled on July l2, 2o2l:\ne The Government will provide expert notice to the defense by April 23, 2o2l.\ne The defense shall file any additional or supplemental motion briefing in light of the\nS2 Indictment by May 7, 2o2l. The Government shall file its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> briefing\nby May 2l, 2o2l.

The\nGovernment has also agreed to provide notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), a\nproposed witness list, Jencks Act material, and Giglio material 45 days in advance of trial. As a\nresult, the defense will receive many of these disclosures weeks in advance of when is typical for\ncriminal defendants in this District, thereby further ensuring ample time to prepare for trial. To\nthe extent the defense claims that it will need to retain additional experts to review electronic\nevidence, it appears that would be true regardless of the S2 Indictment because the electronic\ndiscovery materials referenced in the defense’s most recent leter were already part of the discovery\nin this case before the S2 Indictment was returned. In any event, the defense will receive the\nGovernment’s expert disclosure tomorrou, thereby providing more than two months for the\ndefense to consider whether it wishes to offer any <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> expert(s). Further, the defense’s\nsuggestion that it has insufficient time to file additional motions is undercut by the proposed\nschedule agreed upon by the parties, which allous the defense to file its supplemental pretrial\nmotions more than five weeks after the return of the S2 Indictment and its motions in /imine more\nthan eight weeks from today and eleven weeks from the return of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAlthough the defense claims that its trial preparation will be hampered by the COVID-l9\npandemic, the availability of vaccines to all adults in the United States should enable the defense\nteam to conduct any necessary investigation far more expeditiously than was possible a few\nmonths ago.

Those search terms did not include search terms relevant to the\nNPA, and the Government has not searched Atorney-l’s inbox for communications relating to the\nNPA. Instead, because the Government obtained these materials with an eye touards identifying\nany additional witness statements or Giglio material that might not otherwise be contained in the\nFBI Florida File, the Government ran search terms specific to this case, focusing on the names of\nvictims, Government witnesses, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government’s review of the emails\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to its search terms remains ongoing, and the Government will produce any non-\nduplicative documents that warrant disclosure. The Government expects this to be a limited set of\ndocuments that will be produced along with other Jencks Act and Giglio material. Of course,\nshould the Government identify any exculpatory material during this review, including with\nrespect to the NPA, it will promptly produce such material.\n\nAs the foregoing illustrates, the Government has taken an expansive approach to discovery\nand is close to completing its review of files from other agencies for Jencks Act and Giglio\nmaterial. Thus far, the Government has not identified potential Brady material with respect to the\nNPA during its review. To the extent the Government identifies potential Brady material with\nrespect to the NPA, that is, material that supports Maxwell’s reading of the NPA as discussed\nabove, or any other exculpatory material, the Government will promptly produce it. Houever,\n> More specifically, it appears that OPR obtained an entire snapshot of Atorney-l’s inbox,\nspanning several years, and encompassing all of Atorney-l’s emails during that time period. In\nother words, the inbox is not specific to the Epstein investigation, and it contains a high volume of\ncommunications relating to other cases and other internal SDFL maters. The snapshot provided\nby OPR contains emails and their atachments, both inbound and outbound, totaling more than\n3oo,ooo documents.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3959\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page8ofl7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Moreover, BSF and its co-counsel have a common interest\nprotection in their communications. The Defendant’s overbroad Requests make it impossible for\nBSF to determine hou many <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> communications would be protected and why.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 _ Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of 34\n“ongoing criminal investigation” into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate\ndocuments, invoking the “law enforcement privilege.” Ex.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 297 Filed o6/o2/2l Page2of2\n- November 8, 2o2l: Defense disclosures pursuant to Rules l6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B)\nmaterials (The Government proposed November l, 2o2l; the Defendant proposed the\nclose of the Government’s case-in-chief)\n- Close of the Government’s case-in-chief: Defense witness list and 26.2 statements\n(Defendant’s proposal)\nThese dates establish a baseline for when the parties must disclose certain materials.\nEach of the parties has a continuing obligation to update all disclosures if they become aware of\nadditional <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> materials.

A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses.

Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit.

(Sealed Aff. and |\nAppl. of AUSA Alex Rossmiller dated Feb. 5, 2ol9 (““Gov’t Appl.”), Dkt.

These materials are arguably subject to the Protective Order. |\nOn February 5, 2ol9, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |\nSweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § l65l(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |\nProtective Order so that it could respond to the subpoena.

Request\n\nMs. Maxwell filed various pretrial motions which are currently pending before the Court.\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that one or more of her pending motions will require the presentation of\nevidence, that certain evidence central to the accusations in this mater will need to be examined\nin advance of trial as part of the investigation of her defense, and that the requested evidence is\nadmissible at trial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks production of these materials in advance of\ntrial. She makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in favor of an ex parte”\nprocess and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and trial strategy to\ndemonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility requirements of a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena. United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nIt is well-established that the Court may order that the materials should be produced to\ncounsel’s office, rather than to the courtroom itself. See, e.g., United States v. DNRB, Inc., No.\n4:l5-cr-o362, 2ol7 WL 28o625l, at *3 (W.D. Mo. June 27, 2ol7) (directing production to\nrequesting party); United States v. Jewell, Crim.

Once delivered to counsel's office, the materials are not automatically\nrequired to be shared with the government. Whether they are required to be shared is determined\nby other applicable rules, e.g., Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b).\n\nAs with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in\nfavor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and\ntrial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 5 of 6o\nATTACHMENT A\nDEFINITIONS\n\nl. “You” or “Your” means Annie Farmer.\n\n2. “Journal” means the spiral notebook depicted in Exhibit A to this Atachment A.\n\n3. “Black Boots” means the footwear depicted in Exhibit B to this Atachment A.\n\n4. “Photographs” means the original developed film photographs, any negatives reflecting these\nphotographs, and any digital images of those photographs, all produced in the Annie Farmer\nv.

Rather than focus narrouly on reliable opinions that would be relevant to\nissues in this case, the defendant proposes to have Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus testify broadly about\na wide variety of topics, from testimony about various psychological disorders to testimony\nregarding the generation of false memories in laboratory setings, that are not helpful to the jury.\nMany of those opinions are also unreliable, squarely within the ken of the average juror, or would\ninvade the province of the Court and the jury if offered.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Rocchio is permited to testify on her opinions, the Court should admit\nreliable opinions on the same topics by defense experts. But the defense’s expert notice for Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus is far more expansive, and some of the defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> opinions are not\nreliable. The Court should preclude many of their opinions.\n\nl. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE CERTAIN OPINIONS FROM DR. DIETZ\nA. Background\n\nAs described in the defense expert notice, atached as Exhibit A!, the defense offers the\nopinions of Dr. Dietz, an expert psychiatrist, both in response to the Government’s expert Dr. Lisa\nRocchio and on several other subjects.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version of Exhibit A and to seal Exhibit B. The\nproposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although these exhibits are\njudicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been\npublicly identified, and who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain\nvictims and witnesses testify under pseudonyms, and third parties. Because the Government has\nalready moved to file a redacted version of Exhibit A (see Dkt. No. 4l8), the same version is\natached to this motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page6of4l\n\nAs to Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, Dr. Dietz offers the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> opinions:\n\ne The word “grooming” “imputes motive and intent without adequate evidence of\neither,” including to the defendant. (Ex. A at 3).\n\ne “[G]rooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that there is\nno valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” (/d. at 4\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)).\n\ne “In any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming\nhas occurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of individuals.\nSuch judgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced.”\n\ne “There is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third parties,” and it is not\naccepted in the relevant community. “[I]t has not and cannot be tested; and there is no\nknoun or potential rate of error.”\n\ne The notion that “individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse” is ‘“‘a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is “not\nbased on empirical data.”\n\nAs explained belou, the Government agrees that Dr. Dietz may offer an opinion on the difficulty\nof accurately determining whether an act constitutes grooming, in response to Dr. Rocchio.\nAlthough his remaining opinions purport to respond to Dr. Rocchio, houever, they are themselves\nunreliable or invade the province of the jury, and should be precluded.\n\nBeyond his response to Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, Dr. Dietz offers several additional\nopinions, to which the Government objects as discussed herein. As to “hindsight bias,” Dr. Dietz\nopines:\n\ne Hindsight bias, or “the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an\n\nevent is after being informed about the outcome of an event,” exists and has been found\nin various experiments. (Ex. A at 4-5).\ne Hindsight bias “affects legal judgments.” (/d. at 5).\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 57 of 69\nadmissible to demonstrate the lack of any intent or knouledge on the part of Ms. Maxwell.

Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.\n\nThe government challenges what it characterizes as four opinions Dr. Dietz might offer in\nresponse to testimony from Dr. Rocchio.! As explained belou, though, Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in more than the four narrou ways identified by the\ngovernment. In addition, much of his proposed testimony has independent relevance. In any\nevent, none of the government’s challenges is persuasive.\n\nFirst, the government challenges Dr. Dietz’s proposed testimony (l) that Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinion on grooming “carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of\n‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,” and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or\nenticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead that she allegedly “recruited and groomed\nminors to provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at lo. The government says these\nthree opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for a Daubert hearing and not\nfor the jury trial.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for Dr. Dietz to opine that Dr. Rocchio’s definition of\n“srooming” risks “imputing motive and intent” to the defendant because that is precisely why\nthere is no setled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has conceded is a\nproper subject of Dr. Dietz’s expert opinions. Supra Note l; Ex. l, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can\ninform the jury why the science does not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.\n\nDr. Dietz will not himself (and Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to\nMs. Maxwell, nor will he testify that the jury lacks sufficient evidence to ascribe motive and\n\n' The government agrees Dr. Dietz can inform the jury that Dr. Rocchio is wrong to\nsuggest that grooming has a setled definition. Mot. at 9.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 28\nMaxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for herself,” Ex. l, p 4,\nthese are proper subjects of Dr. Dietz’s testimony because they form the basis of his principal\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> opinion: Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable generally and particularly in the\ncontext of this case. The Rules of Evidence are clear that an expert can inform the jury of the\nbases of his opinions. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o3.\n\nSecond, the government claims that Dr. Dietz’s reasoning is “circular.” Mot. at lo. The\ngovernment characterizes Dr. Dietz’s opinion as follous:\n\n[I]t is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive and intent,” because\n\ngrooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\n\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. That is,\n\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming\n\nbehaviors.\n\nId. (citing Ex. l, p 3). In an unconsciously revealing way, the government misunderstands Dr.\nDietz’s opinion.\n\nThe government’s objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinion is the very objection that Dr. Dietz has\nto Dr. Rocchio’s opinion. Dr. Dietz is critical of Dr. Rocchio’s view of “grooming” because it\nrisks imputing motive and intent to innocuous conduct “without adequate evidence of either.”\nEx. l, p 3. Dr. Dietz proposes to identify this circular reasoning for the jury, so jurors can\nevaluate Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and decide whether it is worth of belief.\n\nThe risk of imputing motive and intent is not abstract. After all, the government itself\ndoes so. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 4l2 motion, the government flat out said that\n“Te]vidence of grooming is evidence of intent.” Gov’t Resp. to Rule 4l2 Mot., p 7.\n\n435, p ll). To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony, houever, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” (terminology aside, id. at lo), Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as\ndescribed herein.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o4 _ Filed ll/24/2l Pagelofl\nSmith Villazer LLP\n25o West 55th Street, 3oth Floor\nSM IT H | V | LLAZOR New York, NY lool9\nwww.smithy llazorcom\nUSDCSDN¥ = ——~™N PATRICK J.

And contrary to the Defense’s briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz’s expert notice\ncontradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio’s role in a clinical seting. He lists “indices” that\n“professionals often use.” Notice at lo. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a\nclinical seting must use these indices to verify their patients’ claims. On the forensic side, Dr.\nRocchio takes on “an investigative role” and does not accept claims “at face value.” Nov. lo Tr.\nat l5. But Dr. Dietz’s opinion about evaluating victims’ credibility still has litle relevance to\nDr. Rocchio’s forensic evaluations. In explaining her method, Dr. Rocchio did not say that she\n“‘base[s] her opinions” on victims’ emotional distress. Def. Br. at l4. Rather, she testified that\nshe looks at a significant volume of documentation, conducts an 8 to lo-hour in-person\nevaluation, and “conduct[s] collateral interviews with others.” Nov. lo Tr. at 37-38. And\nconsistent with Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio said that she looks “for consistencies and\ninconsistencies in what the individual is telling [her] in order to form an opinion.” /d. at 39. In\nsum, Dr. Dietz’s opinion of determining witnesses’ credibility has litle relevance to rebut or\n“critique” Dr. Rocchio’s methods. Def. Br. at l3.\n\nSecond, there is a significant risk of prejudice. As explained, expert testimony that\nevaluates witnesses’ credibility is inadmissible. For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin\naffirmed the exclusion of an expert opinion that a witness’s “confidence in identification is not a\ngood predictor of accuracy” because it “would effectively have inserted [the expert’s] oun view\nof the [testifying witness’s] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.” l92\nF.3d at 288-89.

These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3.

A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI.

Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” /d. at l2—l3.

Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. /d. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” /d. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at 27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

But in any event\nthe Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,\nit is <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso\nsuggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login\ndata, which shous that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”\nundermines that claim.

In response to a question\nfrom defense counsel, the Government asked Flatley hou he determined the number of user\naccounts and logins, and Flatley rechecked those numbers. That information is additional detail\nfor the December 2 notes, and not itself expert opinion, new or otherwise. (And the production of\n35oo material the same day it was generated is hardly an “untimely disclosure.”)\n\ne Although the Government has noticed the testimony, the Government is not planning\nto elicit any expert testimony about “clones.” (Def.

He will simply provide fact\ntestimony that he personally created an image of the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55.\n\ne Testimony that “once a file is burned onto a CD, can’t unburn it” and “on original CD,\ncreated date would be the same date as the modified date,” (Def. Leter at 5), is pure fact testimony.\nIt requires no specialized training to knou that information; Flatley can testify to those facts based\non his personal knouledge.

After all,\nif Kate had testified that she visited Ms. Maxwell in l994 at Ms. Maxwell’s home in the\nKensington neighborhood of London, the l996 Agreement for the sale of the Kinnerton Street\nhome in the Belgravia neighborhood of London would have been irrelevant.

These searches uncovered a significant\namount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data and physical\nevidence.\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images\nand videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten\nthousand dounloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and\nother pornography. ... Only a fraction of this material would have been aired\npublicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal served only to protect victims and did\nnot expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.\nThrough this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials\nand will not permit the release of child pornography.\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.” There was also no\ncredible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of\nhis actions. We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation\nagainst uncharged third parties... .\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 759 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6 of 267 2o33\nLCACmaxl\n\nl MR.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'!

Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020261.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt SieeutreriZ72o 2Ailed l4/23/26 aragef 2 af 2\nPage 2\nseven days per week.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020403.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel7 of 9l\n\nl2/o7/2o2o ENDORSED LETTER as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\nquestionnaire, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\nquestionnaire, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at 2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\nquestionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” Jd. at l2-l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020967.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 24 of 4o\nl. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. Id. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” Jd. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020974.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel48 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\n\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll.

Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses.

EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

In its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ol9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023282.tif": "the 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”?*8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”°*? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”°°? The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\n389 The Department’s Office of Legal Programs provided a training entitled Crime Victims’ Rights in the Federal\nSystem to the USAO on January lo, 2o2o.\n39o See In re Wild, No. l9-l3843, Petition for a Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3) (Sept. 3o, 2ol9).\n39l Wild, Brief of the United States of America in Response to Petition for Writ of Mandamus Under the Crime\nVictims Rights Act at l4 (Oct. 3l, 2ol9). As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023325.tif": "METHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2. EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023441.jpg": "revive Epstein.

The BOP indicated in its response that it\nagreed with all eight recommendations.\nThe follouing provides the OIG’s analysis of the BOP’s response and a summary of the actions necessary to\nclose the recommendations. The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response\nto the recommendations within 9o days of the issuance of this report.\nRecommendation l: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in custody who face mental\n\nhealth challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation. Our practice is to\n\ncarefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved and overarching\n\nsafety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP has updated its\n\nprocess related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP's revised process,\n\nupon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists make\n\nindividualized care recommendations about clinical follou-up and other custodial concerns,\n\nincluding housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees work\n\ncollaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\n\nappropriately.\nOIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is <span class=\"highlight\">responsive</span> to this recommendation. The OIG will consider whether to\nclose this recommendation after the BOP (l) provides for the OIG's review a proposed process for assigning\na cellmate follouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2)\nimplements the process.\nRecommendation 2: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide\nand for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-\nassignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nStatus: Resolved.\nBOP Response: The BOP reported the follouing:\n\nThe BOP concurs with this recommendation.
