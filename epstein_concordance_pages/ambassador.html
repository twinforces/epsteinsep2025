The Court in Libby ruled in favor for the defense and granted\nthe motion to compel discavery in several key areas of the case. ,\nThis Court will find Libby, supra, important because the Court’s decision in that case\nfocused on “all agencies” that have information regarding the offenses charged. In the instant ,\n| mater, therefore, it will not be enough for the government to state that other agencies may not be\nallied with the prosecution, or that the government lacks access to the documents. If the\n| documents provide exculpatory evidence, and are related to the issues in the indictment, they\nmust be produced.\nIn Marshall, l32 F.3d at 63, the defendant was charged in a drug related transaction.\nThere were records on visitation from the local jail where the defendant was incarcerated, pager\nrecords, the pager, and local records from the county public records about a traffic stop. These\nitems were uncovered by the government agents investigating the mater, but only after\ndiscovery had been concluded. During the course of the trial, the Court took a four-day\nadjournment, in order to address the newly discovered evidence. The trial judge decided to\nexclude all of the newly discovered evidence, and, as a result, Marshall was found guilty. On\nappeal, the government argued that, in fact, the newly discovered evidence, under Rule l6,\ntended to incriminate, not exculpate Marshall. On appeal, the Court disagreed, citing Rule\nl6(a)(l)(C} as requiring the production of items that are material to the preparation of the\ndefendant’s case. The Court, in addition, rejected the government’s argument, that the items\nmust be ‘materially exculpatory,’ Jd. at 68. In announcing the rule, that Court stated: “In United\nStates v. Lloyd, we said that evidence is material under Rule l6 ‘as long as there is a strong\nindication that it will play an important role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness\npreparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting impeachment or rebutal.” See Lloyd at 35l.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031238.jpg": "Albuquerque Tribune Online Page 8 of 28\n\ne $29,loo Paul H.
