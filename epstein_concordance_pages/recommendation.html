Inter-\npreting a plea agreement which provided that the\n“United States” would make certain recommendations\nregarding the defendant’s sentence, the court held\nthat this provision was binding on the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice in another district and that the terms of the\nagreement should be enforced.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the lst day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 348\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\nZ Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a child, in violation of FI.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.

In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3257", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!\"\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3272", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003275.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !*4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. .

No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 348\npreparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.””*° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to\nus... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.””*! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submited a second lengthy\nleter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state\nhandle the mater.\n\nMenchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 3l, 2oo7, to\nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed\nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nBy early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys—Starr and Lefkouitz—joined the\ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I\nhave not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for\nSeptember 7, 2oo7, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterban met with Starr, Lefkouitz,\nand Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense. She did\nnot recall specifics of the discussion, houever.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo336o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials.

Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.~> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.” The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.*® On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neS Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nat Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n28 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454AXX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. ___, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IT.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 77 of 349\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8o of 349\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\n| Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalin Beach County State Atomey’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a cluld, in violation of Fl.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4377", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 82 of 349\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 97 of 349\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, ‘and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!'?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nM3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page loo of 349\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\n\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4397", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo7 of 349\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so I’d want [M]arie on the call[.] I'll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.'”3\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !74\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in a plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “TI bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had.\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. .

No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached.

He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l85 of 349\npreparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.””°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to\nus... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.”**! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submited a second lengthy\nleter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state\nhandle the mater.\n\nMenchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 3l, 2oo7, to\nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed\nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nBy early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys—Starr and Lefkouitz—joined the\ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I\nhave not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for\nSeptember 7, 2oo7, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterban met with Starr, Lefkouitz,\nand Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense. She did\nnot recall specifics of the discussion, houever.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

See PSR at 65.\nRegarding a sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, Probation has identified several\nmitigating factors. Maxwell is 6l years old, and a guidelines sentence may be\ntantamount to a lifetime term of imprisonment. The defendant has a reported history\nof philanthropy, charitable work, and helping others namely her work with the\nClinton Global Initiative, The TerraMar Project, her use of EMT skills to help\nothers, and her tutoring of inmates at the MDC. We further acknouledge that\nMaxwell is not solely responsible for the horrendous and irreparable damage caused\nby the decade.\nPSR at 66-67.\nAdjustment to Incarceration\nDespite her extraordinarily restrictive conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell has availed\nherself of any programming or work opportunity available to her. While in solitary confinement,\nshe completed six courses, but until transferred to general population, she never had the\nopportunity to make use of that training. Post-trial she was permited to work as an orderly which\nhas continued in general population. Since placed in general population, she has eagerly provided\na wide variety of assistance to the women is her unit, including GED tutoring. See PSR. §l6. In\naddition, she has participated in and completed several educational courses. See PSR §l5.\n* Ms. Maxwell is planning to appeal her conviction follouing sentencing. Accordingly, any discussion of\nthe trial evidence in this submission is not an admission by Ms. Maxwell as to its accuracy or veracity.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo455", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel6 of 55\nfully nude when the defendant walked into the massage room. (/d.). The defendant told Carolyn\nthat she had a nice body and touched Carolyn’s breasts. (/d.).\n\nAt some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had any young friends she could bring for\nmassages. (PSR § 7l). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to massage Epstein, including\nmultiple minors. (/d.). When Carolyn brought girls to massage Epstein, both the girl and Carolyn\nwould be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). During those massages, Epstein masturbated and\ntouched Carolyn’s and her friend’s breasts and butocks. (/d.).\n\n6. Sexual Abuse of Melissa\n\nOne of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein was\nnamed Melissa. (PSR { 8o). Melissa was just l6 years old when she went with Carolyn to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (/d.). Melissa went to Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein\nwith massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of l8. (/d.). When Melissa and\nCarolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then\nreturned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). An entry entitled ‘“Melissa’s cell (Carolyn’s\nfriend),” as well as multiple entries with Carolyn’s full name and an entry entitled “Virginia\n(parents)” were listed in the defendant and Epstein’s black address book under the heading\n“Massage — Florida.” U/d.; PSR 9.57). Thus, as a direct result of the pyramid scheme that began\nwith Virginia and continued with Carolyn, Melissa suffered repeated sexual abuse.\n\nII. The Pre-Sentence Report and Sentencing Guidelines\n\nThe United States Probation Office, in its Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, recommends\na sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. In making that <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, the Probation Office\ncharacterized the defendant’s offense conduct as “heinous and predatory in nature.” (PSR at 67).\nRegarding the defendant’s role, the Probation Office emphasized that “[t]he gravity of Maxwell’s\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Page3of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in Criminal Case\nSheet 2 — Imprisonment\nJudgment — Page 3 of 8\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: S22o CR 33o (AJN)\nIMPRISONMENT\nThe defendant is hereby commited to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a\ntotal term of:\nThe Defendant is sentenced to a term of 24o Months.\nCount 3 a sentence of 6o Months.

We\n3 recognize that any sentence in this case is going to be\n\n4 significant and is going to be immensely punishing. The\n\na probation department, based on the original guidelines in the\n\n6 presentence report, recommended a dounward variance to 2o\n\n7 years. That <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> is nou higher than the guideline\n\n8 range that is applicable in this case. But we ask the Court to\n9 consider the justification that probation articulated in the\n\nlo presentence report in fashioning a sentence that takes into\n\nll consideration that a sentence louer than the guideline range is\nl2 appropriate in this case.\n\nl3 The government's sentence asks for the outer limits,\nl4 and although we still believe that even the <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> is\nl5 too high, a sentence within the guideline range nou may be more\nl6 reasonable, but it still does not take into consideration some\nl7 of the various factors that we have brought to the Court's\n\nl8 atention in our submission. Simply stated, based upon the\n\nl9 conduct of conviction, the government's request is out of\n2o proportion. Jeffrey Epstein would have faced the same\n2l sentence, and he is clearly far more culpable than Ghislaine\n22 Maxwell.\n23 THE COURT: You mean he would have faced the same\n24 guidelines.\n25 MS.

There is no compelling necessity for that.\nThe Court has ordered the Government to produce these transcripts for the Court’s in camera |\nreview by Monday, July 28, 2o25.

It is the defendant's burden of production\n2o to rebut the presumption that there are no set of conditions\nal that could reasonably assure her continued appearance in this\n22 case. The government has the ultimate burden of persuasion,\n23 but it is the defendant's burden of production. She has failed\n24 to meet that burden for the reasons we set forth in our\n25 briefing and arguments today.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9997", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date.

As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Late July 2oo6: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves\nForward with a Federal Investigation\n\nSeveral days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July l9, 2oo6, Assistant\nState Atorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.”*> Krischer told OPR that\n“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”° The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\n23 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\n24 Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n2 Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2oo6CF9454A XX (July l9, 2oo6), atached as Exhibit l to this Report.\n26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the Ist day of August [2oo4] and October 3l, 2oo5,\n[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three\nor more occasions.” The l5-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made\nit impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the\nstate indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\na The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a\nmore detailed discussion of the Petite policy.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021250.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OG 3536o38, Page/8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021253.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Sey, ae 3536o38, Page8l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 348\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\na Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a child, in violation of Fl.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l255", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021270.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E96 3536o38, Page98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 348\nevidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\n\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed.\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.'l3\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l27o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021273.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA.99 3536o38, Pagelol of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 348\ntwelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021280.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo6 3536o38, Pagelo8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 348\nprecluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk. My caveat is that in the middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining my\nstaff by allouing ‘interlocutor[]y’ appeals so to speak so ’d want [M]arie on the call[.] [Pll have\nher set something up.”\n\nVillafafia sent to Lefkouitz her oun revised NPA, telling him it was her “atempt at\ncombining our thoughts,” but it had not “been approved by the office yet.” She inserted solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense, as the charge to which Epstein would\nplead guilty; proposed a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month sentence, divided into l8 months\nin the county jail and l2 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.’\nVillafafia’s revision retained the provision suspending the investigation and holding all legal\nprocess in abeyance, and she incorporated the non-prosecution provision while slightly altering it\nto apply to “any potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and\ndeleting mention of the corporate entity employees. Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. l”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing in aplea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl3 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\na Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021284.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONTOS 3536o38, Pagell2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7; ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned.\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system.

In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021358.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 84 3536o38, Pagel86 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 348\npreparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.”*°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[l]t would probably be helpful to\nus ... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.””*! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submited a second lengthy\nleter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state\nhandle the mater.\n\nMenchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 3l, 2oo7, to\nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed\nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nBy early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys—Starr and Lefkouitz—joined the\ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds . . . that I\nhave not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for\nSeptember 7, 2oo7, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterban met with Starr, Lefkouitz,\nand Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense. She did\nnot recall specifics of the discussion, houever.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l358", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in\nreaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these\ndiscussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure\nof any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine\nthe DOJ-OIG’s ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to\ninmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on\nthe issues. Accordingly, Thomas’s motion should be denied for the reason that the materials\nsought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9.\n\nSecond, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector\nGeneral’s Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials\nupon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure.

According to a statement made at the time by the\nState Atorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest\nto louest, without a <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of\nthe room.”* The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7, a felony under state law because\nit alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”> The indictment did not identify the person or\npersons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”° On July 23,\n2oo6, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the\ncharges were made public.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that\npoint because she believed the State Atorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a\nreduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy\nmight preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely\nbelieved that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had\nsufficient evidence.”\neo Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed\nthem. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance\nin this Report.\nad Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls,” Palm Beach Post, July 29, 2oo6, citing\nstatement by State Atorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.\n23 Indictment in State v.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward\nat trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.\n27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal\ncharges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal\ngovernment from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquited, or convicted on state charges based on\nthe same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United\nStates, 587 U.S. __, l39 S. Ct. l96o, l966-67 (2ol9) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S.\nl87, l95 (l959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 26o U.S. 377, 382 (l922). Nonetheless, to\nbeter promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in l959 and l96o to\nguide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion.

He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case.

Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\nSubsequent events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°? Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\npe Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9° In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023088.jpg": "Sloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “‘a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.*4 Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\nal In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nBe Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried .. . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n8 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023091.jpg": "CONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\ni Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a child, in violation of Fl.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023106.jpg": "D. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023108.jpg": "evidence of a violation of the agreement. Epstein and his counsel\nagree that the computers that are currently under [legal process] will\nbe safeguarded in their current condition by Epstein’s counsel or\ntheir agents until the terms and conditions of the Agreement are\nfulfilled.\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a lengthy email to convey two options Lourie had\nsuggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea but with an agreement for an l8-month sentence,\nor pleas to state charges and two federal obstruction-of-justice charges. Villafafia also told\nLefkouitz she was willing to ask Acosta again to approve a federal plea to a five-year conspiracy\nwith a Rule ll(c) binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 2o-month sentence. Villafafia explained:\n\nAs to timing, it is my understanding that Mr. Epstein needs to be\nsentenced in the state after he is sentenced in the federal case, but\nnot that he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his\nfederal time. Andy recommended that some of the timing issues be\naddressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the\njudge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison\npurposes.\n\nWith regard to prosecution of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia suggested standard\nfederal plea agreement language regarding the resolution of all criminal liability, “and I will\nmention ‘co-conspirators,’ but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes\nand all of the other persons that we could charge.” Villafafia told OPR that she was willing to\ninclude a non-prosecution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the time she understood\nto be the four women named in the proposed agreement, because the USAO was not interested in\nprosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered a plea. Villafafia told OPR, “[W]e considered\nEpstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn’t have been interested in prosecuting anyone\nelse.” She did not consider the possibility that Epstein might be trying to protect other, unnamed\nindividuals, and no one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafafia also told\nOPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge”\nrelated to her concern that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged conduct,\nthe court might ask for more information about that conduct and inquire why it had not been\ncharged, and if the government provided such information, Epstein’s atorneys might claim the\nagreement was breached.!!?\n\nWith regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that the USAO generally did not take any\nposition in plea agreements on immigration issues, and that in this case, there was no evidence that\neither of the two assistants who were foreign nationals had commited fraud in connection with\ntheir immigration paperwork, “and I think that they were both in status. So there wasn’t any reason\nl3 OPR understood Villafafia’s concern to be that if the government were required to respond to a court’s inquiry\ninto additional facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast him in a negative light in order to\ninfluence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023111.jpg": "twelve months, with six served in home confinement, to run\nconsecutively.\nI just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do l2\nmonths imprisonment instead.\nAs you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about doing\njail time.

When [Epstein] gets out, he has to plead to state\noffenses, including against minor, registrable, and then take one year house arrest/community\nconfinement.” By reply email, Villafafia asked Lourie to call her, but there is no record of whether\nthey spoke.\n\nF. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of\n\nthe Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO Rejects\n\nApproximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting the deal he had reached with\nLefkouitz, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite the agreement Lourie\nbelieved he and Lefkouitz had reached that morning, Lefkouitz’s proposal would have resulted\nin a l6-month federal sentence folloued by 8 months of supervised release served in the form of\nhome detention. Lefkouitz also inserted a statement in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the\nUSAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authorities to institute immigration\nproceedings against two of Epstein’s female assistants.\n\nVillafafia circulated the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Lourie and two other\nsupervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated terms that were\n“completely different from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafia also pointed\nout that the defense “wants us to recommend an improper calculation” of the sentencing guidelines\nll8 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke because in his view the continued back-and-\nforth communications with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get this deal done” might be to\nhave a direct conversation with Epstein.\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023118.jpg": "precluding the government from requesting, initiating, or recommending immigration proceedings\nagainst the two assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAt this point, Lefkouitz again sought to speak to Acosta, who replied by email: “I am\nhappy to talk.

Finally, Villafafia deleted mention of\nimmigration proceedings, but advised in her transmital email that “we have not and don’t plan to\nask immigration” proceedings to be initiated. !”4\n\nLater that day, Villafafia alerted Lourie (who had arrived in Florida from Washington, D.C.\nearly that afternoon) and the new West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and\nco-counsel) that she had included language that defense counsel had requested “regarding\npromises not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There is no\ndocumentation that Lourie, the West Palm Beach manager, or anyone else expressed disagreement\nwith Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent her email, adding\nthat defense counsel was persisting in including an immigration waiver in the agreement, to which\nLourie responded, “No way. We don’t put that sort of thing ina plea agreement.” Villafafia replied\nto Lourie, indicating she would pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other\nthoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafafia informed defense counsel that Lourie\nhad rejected the proposed immigration language.\n\nOPR questioned the subjects about the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left\nthat provision in the NPA because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some\nway. In particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to prosecute “any potential\nco-conspirators” protected victims who had recruited others and thus potentially were\nco-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t\ngoing to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta “didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in\nl23 Villafafia noted that she had consulted with a USAO employee who was a “former corporate counsel from a\nhospital” about the § 2255 language, and thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about having an\nunlimited number of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls who I do not represent.”\n\nl4 Villafafia gave OPR an explanation similar to that given by the case agents—that an ICE Special Agent had\nbeen involved in the early stages of the federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafafia believed the agent knew two of\nEpstein’s female assistants were foreign nationals and would have acted appropriately on that information. Villafafia\nalso said that the USAO generally did not get involved in immigration issues.\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023122.jpg": "The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023123.jpg": "agreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'’? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM 8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023176.jpg": "Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office.

In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached.

You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023196.jpg": "preparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up\nalready.””°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the\nvictims’ credibility to formulate his charging <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> supported his statements to OPR\nthat such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored\ninto the government’s charging strategy.\n\nThe two February 2oo7 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and\nclaims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2oo7, defense atorneys requested\nanother meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a\npresentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was\ngranted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to\nus... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting\ntook place on June 26, 2oo7. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to\nthe defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense\ncounsel used that information to prepare a l9-page leter, submited to the USAO the day before\nthe June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,\nLourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A\ncontemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as\nprimarily a “listening session.””*! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submited a second lengthy\nleter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state\nhandle the mater.\n\nMenchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 3l, 2oo7, to\nfacilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed\nterms of a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nBy early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys—Starr and Lefkouitz—joined the\ndefense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds. . . that I\nhave not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for\nSeptember 7, 2oo7, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterban met with Starr, Lefkouitz,\nand Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,\nwith Oosterban participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman\nand Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhou, if we don’t meet\nwith them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline\nhas to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”\nbut a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already\ndecided hou he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our\nposition.”\n\n23o Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have\nnothing on at all.”\n\n23l During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the\ngovernment’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break\nin the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense. She did\nnot recall specifics of the discussion, houever.\n\nl58\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l96", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023200.jpg": "promise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l/8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR\non Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant. At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023371.jpg": "Epstein was housed, from the common area of the SHU between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and\napproximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\nIn Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including identification and a description of\nsignificant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the applicable laws, federal\nregulations, and BOP policies.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9.

Houever, Epstein\nremained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation\nuntil July 3o, 2ol9.4\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the\ninmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a\nlouer classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except\nthat inmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by\nPsychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see hou an inmate was\ndoing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who\ngoes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes\nrecommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of\nsuicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off\nof suicide watch be housed with other inmates; houever, she said the recommendations cannot always be\ncarried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends\nconducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.\nThe Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide\nPrevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive\nstaff the <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief\nPsychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be\nhoused with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.\nAccording to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted\ndisciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was\ninsufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically\nevaluated on July 3o, 2ol9, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember\nhou he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023410.jpg": "companion program at an institution to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised\nby the institution’s Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator.\nOn July 9, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein.

The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability.

Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2's Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt.

The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l <span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span>\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\n<span class=\"highlight\">recommendation</span> is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.

If the Regional Administrative\nRemedy Coordinator agrees that the request is sensitive, the\nrequest shall be accepted, investigated, and responded to.\nOtherwise, the request will not be accepted, and the inmate will\nbe advised in writing of that determination, without return of\nthe request. The inmate may then pursue the mater by submiting\na request for Administrative Remedy locally to the Warden. The\nWarden shall allou a reasonable extension of time for such a\nresubmission. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l7.\nSpecial procedures regarding the appeal of Disciplinary Hearing\nOfficer (DHO) actions may be found at 28 C.F.R. §542.l4(d) (2).\nAppeals from DHG actions shall be submited initially to the\nRegional Director for the region where the inmate is currently\nlocated.\nG. Inmate Designations\nThe majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates\nwho, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another\ninstitution. Houever, an inmate is not transported to a new\ninstitution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement and commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve 4a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

Cellmate Assignments\n\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the\nimportance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes\nconsultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision\nmaking of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members\npresent when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include\n\nan outline of the training and evidence of staff who atended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In\naddition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when\nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more\nappropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual\nTraining began the week of January 6, 2o2o, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2o2o.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25lo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025115.jpg": "Page 753\nPsychology verbally notifies the Operations Lieutenant when inmates are removed from suicide watch and that they\nwill need to be placed with a cellmate.

The C&A officer is responsible for\nentering the proper assignment.\nOnce an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and\nLieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.\nThe e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with.

Rounds:\nSHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within\nthe policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a\ndaily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly.

All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior.

Cellmate Assignments:\nInmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department\nhead meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings.

Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination.

Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.
