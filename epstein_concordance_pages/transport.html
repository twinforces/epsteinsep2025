We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase.

We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan essential ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo948", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000950.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt Tibet 2 oPiled OF2GSQoP aeengecs Boo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000980.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAURDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA B72o PagerZ? of 26o\n\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001028.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page87 of 2oo P|\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal presumption that there are no conditions that could\n\n2 reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the\n\n3 defendant has not come anywhere close to rebuting that\n\n4 presumption.\n\n5 Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the\n\n6 offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in\n\n7 this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting\n\n8 minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to\n\n9 travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in\nlo a conspiracy to do the same.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 5of lo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).

In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\n\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (i)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.’ In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\n\n'S The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6o Filed lo/o6/2o Page 2 of 3\nPage 2\n\n§ 37l.

The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts.

The only difference between the two counts is the purported crime\nunderlying the § 37l conspiracy charged. In Count One, it is a violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422\n(enticing minors to travel to engage in illegal sexual activity). /d. 999-lo.

This minor variance is insufficient to avoid the Fifth Amendment’s\ndouble jeopardy bar.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\n“An indictment is multiplicitous when a single offense is alleged in more than one\ncount.” United States v.

The object of both, as claimed by the government, is to\nfirst entice and then to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors across state lines for the purpose of illegal sexual\nactivity. If the conspiracy to entice fails there would, logically, be no one to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe government has alleged the same conspiracy twice in violation of the Fifth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.

Only at this time did the government, according to its oun account, decide to\nlaunch an investigation of Ms. Maxwell and prosecute her on allegations that it had previously,\nrepeatedly (and properly, since any charges would have been baseless) determined did not merit\ncharges. In short, the government’s response to the media frenzy was not to adhere to its earlier\nobjective analysis and consideration of the facts, but to feed the frenzy and substitute Ms.\nMaxwell for Epstein.\n\nThus, the government announced its arrest and indictment of Ms. Maxwell on July 2,\n2o2o, the exact anniversary of Epstein’s indictment. At an extraordinary press conference, the\nUnited States Atorney for this District described Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution as the “prequel” to\nthe Epstein indictment; thereafter, the then-Atorney General, in rare public comments on bail\nproceedings in an individual case, expressed his delight that “we were able to get Miss\nMaxwell.”\n\nBut in trying “to get” Ms. Maxwell, the government compromised its standards, cut\ncorners, and exceeded its authority under the law. This is shoun in the present motion and\nothers we are filing today, and includes the follouing:\n\n* The government has pressed forward with this case even though the NPA expressly\nprovides that “the United States .. . will not institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Rather than argue, as it has time and again, that\nsuch agreements should be construed as drafted, the government does the opposite\nhere, retreating from the very agreement that its oun agents negotiated and agreed to\nwith the approval of senior levels of Main Justice.\n\n* The government has concocted a federal Mann Act case against Ms. Maxwell by\nalleging that, on some unspecified occasion during a four-year period between l994\nand l997, and in an unspecified manner, she somehou transported and caused a\nsingle individual to travel across state lines for purposes of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity with Epstein. Those charges, in turn, require the government to allege\na violation of New York law relating to sexual activity.

Because none of the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell has been charged\nnecessarily entails or requires the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child, § 3283 does\nnot apply here.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\n\nCounts One through Four of the indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell violated and\nconspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 242l-2424. These\ncounts are based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997.\n\nCount One of the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell violated l8 U.S.C. § 2422 (nou\n§ 2422(a))' by conspiring to entice “one or more individuals” to travel in interstate and foreign\ncommerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” Indictment {fj 9-lo. Count Two charges Ms. Maxwell with a substantive § 2422(a)\nviolation, claiming she “persuaded, induced, enticed, and coerced” an individual identified as\nMinor Victim-l to travel from Florida to New York “with the intention that Minor Victim-l\nwould engage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law,\nSection l3o.55.” Jd. ¥ l3.\n\nCount Three alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> “an individual” in interstate\nand foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).

Neither that offense nor a conspiracy to\n“<span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>” a minor with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Instead, as with § 2422(a), the offense is a “crime of\nintent and a conviction is entirely sustainable even if no underlying criminal sexual act ever\noccurs.” United States v. Broxmeyer, 6l6 F.3d l2o, l29 n.8 (2d Cir. 2olo). For this reason,\nCounts Three and Four are not subject to § 3283’s extended statute of limitations.\n\nIt does not mater that the particular facts alleged in the indictment fall within § 3283.\n“The embellishment of the indictment does not lengthen the time for prosecution.” Bridges, 346\nU.S. at 222. Nor does it mater that sexual abuse of a minor may “often accompan[y]” the\noffenses charged. See id. “[U]nder the statute[s] creating the offense[s],” physical or sexual\nabuse of a minor, or kidnapping, is not “an essential ingredient.” /d. Thus, § 3283’s extension\nfor “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of\nl8 years” does not apply.\n° l8 U.S.C. § 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic\nadjustments, immaterial here, to what is nou subsection (a).

But the allegations as to Accuser-3 cannot possibly support the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell: Although the gravamen of a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense is enticing or causing an\nindividual to travel, there is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled—let alone that Ms.\nMaxwell (or Epstein, for that mater) enticed her to do so or transported her. Moreover, although\nboth § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) require an intent that the traveling individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity, the indictment alleges no facts suggesting that Epstein’s alleged sexual activity\nwith Accuser-3, who was over the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times, was\nunlawful. As a result, these allegations serve only to demonstrate a propensity on the part of Ms.\nMaxwell that will prejudice the jury against her.\n\nTo enable the presentation of evidence regarding Accuser-3, the government claims the\nalleged “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 is somehou an “overt act” in furtherance of conspiracies to\ncause unspecified individuals to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\nThe government’s inclusion of these allegations, houever, is nothing more than an atempted\nend-run around its obligations under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). The “overt act” alleged as to\nAccuser-3 has nothing to do with the alleged conspiracy. Moreover, the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

These\ncounts are based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997.\n\nCounts Two and Four allege that Ms. Maxwell substantively violated l8 U.S.C. § 2422\n(nou § 2422(a))? and § 2423(a), respectively, by enticing and causing Accuser-] to travel from\nFlorida to New York in order to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein that would violate N.Y.\nPenal Law § l3o.55. Indictment {ff l3, l9. The indictment does not charge Ms. Maxwell with a\nsubstantive Mann Act violation as to any individual other than Accuser-l, nor does it allege that\nMs. Maxwell personally enticed or caused any person other than Accuser-l to travel in interstate\nor foreign commerce for any reason.\n\nCounts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein “and others” to\nviolate §§ 2422(a) and 2423(a), respectively. Indictment {J 9, l5. Count One alleges that the\nobject of the § 2422(a) conspiracy was to “persuade, induce, entice, and coerce one and more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce, to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense.” /d. § lo.

All References to Accuser-3 Should Be Stricken as Surplusage.\n\nUnder Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may strike\nsurplusage from the indictment or information.” “This rule introduces a means of protecting the\ndefendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which\nmay, houever, be prejudicial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) motions may be granted “where the challenged allegations\nare not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotations omited); see United States v.\nGreebel, No. l5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed.

The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996). To\nestablish a § 2423(a) conspiracy claim, the government must prove that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nto “knouingly <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>[] an individual who ha[d] not atained the age of l8 years in interstate or\nforeign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a)\n(l994); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (l986).4\n\nThe government cannot shou that Ms. Maxwell conspired to commit either offense with\nrespect to Accuser-3. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a conspiracy to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a conspiracy with respect to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. The government contends that the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich, at the time of the alleged offenses, provided that a prosecution involving an “offense\n“ Section 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic adjustments,\nimmaterial here, to what is nou subsection (a).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nRule l7 Subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) with respect to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s motion for an order authorizing a subpoena on BSF pursuant to Rule l7(c)(3)\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the “Subpoena”) and the Court’s March l2, 2o2l,\nSealed and Ex Parte Order requiring BSF to file a leter indicating (l) whether service on BSF can\nbe deemed adequate notice on victims whose personal or confidential information the Subpoena\nis aimed at obtaining and (2) whether the victims object to or seek modification of the Subpoena.\n\nFirst, BSF does not object to service on BSF constituting adequate notice on any victims it\nrepresents. The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transportation of (and conspiracy to\n<span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997. The facts\nunderlying those charges involve three minor victims: Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and\nMinor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for\nlying under oath during a civil deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre when\nasked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she had ever given\nMinor Victim-2 a massage. BSF represents Minor Victim-2 (Annie Farmer) and Virginia Giuffre,\nbut does not represent and has never represented Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-3.\n\nDefendant has made clear since the time of her arrest that she seeks to impugn the\ncredibility of her accusers by constructing a false narrative that BSF’s cooperation with the\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl83 _ Filed o3/26/2l Page 4of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Rather, it called for the\nproduction of the entire investigative file and is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).\n\nSimilarly, Request l2 asks for “EVCP Material,” which is defined as “any submission to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims on behalf of\npersons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases\nsigned by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your Clients.” This\nRequest does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is not a party or otherwise privy to\nwhat information BSF has submited to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program\nor on behalf of which clients BSF has submited such information. The Defendant cannot merely\nrequest every piece of confidential information that BSF submited to the Program in the hopes\nthat something relevant and admissible turns up. This Request thus cannot pass muster under Rule\nl7(c).\n\nSecond, although BSF does not knou what arguments the Defendant made in her ex parte\nmotion, the documents and items requested in the Subpoena bear no apparent relevance to the\nDefendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this mater. And to the extent they would be\nrelevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant cannot\nobtain them in advance of trial pursuant to Rule l7(c). Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 699-7oo, 7ol.\n\nRequest l seeks communications between BSF and the U.S. Atorney about the Defendant\nfrom 2ol5 through the present, and Requests 3 through 5 seek communications between BSF and\nBSF’s co-counsel from 2ol5 through the present regarding any meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s\noffice about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s\nallegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage in sex\nacts between l994 to l997, nearly 2o years prior to any such communications. Nor do such\ncommunications bear any apparent relevance to whether the Defendant perjured herself in a civil\ndeposition. If such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false\nnarrative that BSF somehou colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no\nother purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—seeking\nany grand jury subpoena for documents related to litigation concerning the\nDefendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative of collusion between\nBSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly\nproviding the Government with confidential documents governed by a protective order in a\nseparate civil mater. See, e.g., ECF No. l34 (Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained\nby subpoena to what appears JM).” Even if these documents were relevant to anything other\nRequests 3 through 5 also seek protected work product. Those Requests seek\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in several maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\nWhere a criminal defendant seeks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the\nprivilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the requested items and that he “cannot,\nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.” United States v.\nWeisberg, No. o8-CR-347 NGG RML, 2oll WL l327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y.

This\ninquiry has no relevance here, as this case does not involve the possession of child pornography.\n\nThe crimes charged in the Indictment plainly involved the sexual abuse of minors. First,\nthe Indictment clearly alleges that the minor victims were subjected to actual, physical sexual\ncontact as part of the defendant’s crimes.

Moreover, the Indictment alleges that the defendant persuaded, induced, enticed, and\ntransported minors for purposes of engaging in criminal sexual activity, and that she conspired to\ndo the same. As discussed above, the offenses charged in the Indictment accordingly involved the\nsexual abuse of minors as defined in Section 35o9(a) and incorporated into Section 3283.\n\nBecause the defendant’s crimes involved sexual abuse, the expanded statute of limitations\nset forth in Section 3283 applies to the crimes charged in Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment and her motion should be denied.\n\nIl.

(Def. Mot.\n7). The defendant has not and cannot successfully establish such a violation. First, the defendant\nhas not established that any alleged pre-indictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense.\nHer speculative assertions about lost witnesses and records are hardly the sort of evidence that she\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3oo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 239\nagainst her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant\nis charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,\nspecifically, violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55. Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9. The\ndefendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding hou\nthe defendant commited the charged crimes, the Government is somehou required to provide\neven more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,\nand where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the essential elements of each\ncrime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as\na mater of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.\nVIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any reference to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003122.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 239\n\nSs Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to strike should be denied—or at a minimum deferred until after\nthe conclusion of the Government’s direct case—because all of the challenged allegations pertain\nto evidence that will be relevant and admissible at trial, and are not unduly prejudicial.\n\nFirst, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are properly included in the Indictment’s\ndescription of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three because evidence of those\nincidents is relevant and admissible at trial as direct evidence of the crimes charged. Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd. JJ l, 4, l4. It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It is\naxiomatic that a conspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 239\npublic, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 239\nGovernment further expects Minor Victim-3 will testify that Pe\ndefendant’s intent, in her initial interactions with Minor Victim-3, to entice Minor Victim-3 to\ntravel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.°® Thus, even if Minor Victim-\n3 did not travel as a minor, the events involving Minor Victim-3 outlined in the Indictment\nconstitute direct and admissible evidence of the agreements between and the relationship of the\ndefendant and Epstein. Because evidence regarding Minor Vitim-3 is therefore relevant and\nadmissible at trial, there is no basis to strike these allegations from the Indictment. See Scarpa,\n9l3 F.2d at lol3. Given the relevance of these allegations, the defendant has not satisfied the\n“exacting” standard required to justify striking portions of an Indictment. Murgio, 2o9 F. Supp.\n3d at 724 (quoting Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 6lo). Accordingly, the motion should be denied, or,\nat the very least, deferred until “presentation of the Government’s evidence at trial” after which\nthe Court will have a full understanding of hou Minor Victim-3’s experiences fit into the charged\nconspiracies. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d at 467.\n\nThe fact that the Government would be precluded, by virtue of the statute of limitations,\nfrom bringing a charge based exclusively on the experience of Minor Victim-3 is immaterial. It is\nwell-established that a prosecution for a conspiracy is timely so long as the conspiracy exists and\nat least one timely overt act is commited in furtherance of the conspiracy within the applicable\nstatute of limitations. See United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 6l4 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (citing\nGrunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 396-97 (l957)); United States v. Rutkoske, 5o6 F.3d\nl7o, l74-75 (2d Cir. 2oo7); United States v. Mason, 479 F. App’x 397, 398 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n——————\nand sex acts in London were part of conspiracies to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors.\n\nl63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 239\n4o4(b)(2); (i) is relevant to the crime for which the defendant is on trial; (ll) has probative value\nthat is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudicial effect; and (iv) is admited with a\nlimiting instruction to the jury, if requested. See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 68l, 69l-\n92 (l988); United States v. LaFlam, 369 F.3d l53, l56 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nHere, evidence regarding the defendant’s interactions with Minor Victim-3 is admissible\nto prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi, all of which are permissible\npurposes under Rule 4o4(b). Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used massage to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The similarity sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 239\n4o3.”); United States v.

The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count One or Count Three as Multiplicitous Is\n\nPremature\n\nThe defendant moves to dismiss Counts One or Three on the ground that they are\nmultiplicitous. (Def. Mot. 8). Because the Second Circuit has made clear that a multiplicity\nchallenge does not become timely until after trial, this motion should be denied as premature.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nCount One charges the defendant with participating in a conspiracy, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 37l, to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors with the intent to commit an illegal sex act, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 2422.

Rivera, No. o9 Cr. 6l9 (SJF), 2oll WL l429l25, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2oll)\n(“Since it is possible that the jury will convict defendants on only one (l) of the respective counts\nthat they allege are multiplicitous, and acquit defendants on all of the counts with which they allege\nthat count is multiplicitous, the issue of whether the counts are multiplicitous in violation of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause is premature at the pretrial stage.”’).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One or Three of the Indictment as multiplicitous\nis, at best, premature. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit, this Court should defer\nruling on this motion until after the completion of trial. The additional time will ensure that the\nfull factual record is developed before the Court conducts the multiplicity analysis, and the motion\nmay become moot depending on the jury’s verdict.\n\nFirst, the Court cannot conduct the multiplicity analysis before hearing all of the evidence\nregarding the charges contained in the Indictment. Prior to trial, the record will not be fully\ndeveloped, and the Court cannot conduct the necessary analysis to determine whether the counts\nare in fact multiplicitous. Consistent with the directive of the Second Circuit and the consistent\npractice in this District, the Court should defer conducting any multiplicity analysis until after\nhearing all of the evidence at trial. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355.\n\nSecond, the motion may become moot because it is possible that the jury could conclude\nthat the defendant is guilty of one of the charged conspiracies but not guilty of the other. That is\nbecause each charged conspiracy alleges that the defendant agreed to violate a different criminal\nstatute. Count One alleges that the defendant agreed to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts. Count Three alleges that the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l33", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 239\nwith the intent that they engage in illegal sex acts. In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not\nagree to actually <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at\n\nl73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003139.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 239\nto particulars furnished,” it can “restrict unduly the Government’s ability to present its case.”\nHenry, 86l F. Supp. at ll97; see also Mitlof, 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (recognizing that “care\nmust be taken” because “[t]he government’s presentation of evidence at trial is limited to the\nparticulars contained in the bill”); United States v. Samsonov, No. o7 Cr. ll98 (CM), 2oo9 WL\nl7672l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2oo9) (“The vehicle of a bill of particulars serves to inform a\ndefendant of the nature of the charge, when he is otherwise insufficiently informed, and must not\nbe misused to compel disclosure of hou much the Government can prove, nor to foreclose the\nGovernment from using proof it may develop as the trial approaches.”). Moreover, where the\nGovernment’s provision of particulars is tantamount to an itemized preview of its proof, it creates\nthe very real danger that a defendant will “tailor her testimony to explain away the Government’s\ncase.” Henry, 86l F. Supp. at ll97. These concerns animate the rule that “if the defendant has\nbeen given adequate notice of the charges against her and can prepare fully for trial with reasonably\ndiligent efforts, the Government cannot be required to disclose additional details about its case.”\nId.\nes Discussion\n\nThere is no basis for a bill of particulars in this case. The charges against the defendant\nare clear from the face of the Indictment, which provides significant detail regarding the charged\ncrimes. As is apparent from the l8-page Indictment, the charges concern the defendant’s\nparticipation in conspiracies to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> and entice minor girls to travel with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein from l994 through l997, and the defendant’s atempt\nto cover up that conduct during her civil deposition testimony in 2ol6. Specifically, the Indictment\nmakes plain that the defendant is charged with engaging in a conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minor girls\nwith intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, engaging in a conspiracy to entice\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The indictment is timely\n\nA. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations\n\nFederal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. l8\nU.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,\nCongress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2oo3, the operative version\nof § 3283 alloued prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.\nCongress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-\n2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, to allou prosecution any time during the life of the victim.\n\nThe parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act,\nbut untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2oo3\nversion of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the\ngeneral statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2oo3 version of § 3283\napplies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2oo3. The Court concludes that statute of\nlimitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely.\n\nl. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors\n\nMaxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the Sl superseding indictment involve\nthe sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the\nalleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for\nthat purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view,\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3683", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl4\n\nEven more incomprehensible is the government’s argument that the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are not prejudicial. The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). While the government’s effort to\nestablish the admissibility of such evidence in its opposition suffers from the same infirmities as\nits inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will respond\nto the government’s admissibility arguments more fully at the appropriate time.\n\nl. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in interstate and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d. J] l5-l6). As an overt\nact in furtherance of these conspiracies, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd. JJ lld, l7d (emphasis added). The\nIndictment further alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3. Jd. § 7c.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page6ofl4\n\nThe government does not and cannot dispute that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of\nconsent in England at all relevant times, and that it cannot establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\nsexual encounters with Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful. Nor can the\ngovernment dispute that the Indictment does not contain a single allegation that Ms. Maxwell,\nEpstein, or anyone else ever transported Accuser-3 or enticed her to travel—let alone with the\nintent that she engage in unlawful sexual activity. The Indictment offers no conceivable scenario\nin which Ms. Maxwell’s alleged encouragement of Accuser-3 to engage in lawful sexual activity\nwith Epstein in England “furthered” an alleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the\npurpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\n\nThe government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged interactions with\nAccuser-3 were “part of” such a conspiracy uses bizarre logic. See Opp. l6l. The government\ndoes not claim that any alleged interactions between Ms. Maxwell or Epstein and Accuser-3 in\nany way caused, or atempted to cause, any minor to travel, let alone for the purpose of the\nminor’s involvement in unlawful sexual activity. Instead, the government argues that because it\nhas alleged that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” two other minor individuals who traveled and engaged\nin illegal sex acts with Epstein, it somehou “follous” that encouraging an individual of legal age\nto engage in entirely lawful sexual activity with Epstetn—unaccompanied by any alleged travel\nor intended travel—was “part of” conspiracies to cause underage individuals to travel. Opp. l6l.\n\nApparently recognizing the tenuous connection between its allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 and the alleged conspiracies, the government atempts to bolster its allegations after\nthe fact by proffering Accuser-3’s testimony that she ST\nLe To the extent that it is appropriate for the Court to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page /7ofl4\nconsider such a proffer in the context of a motion to strike,’ the proffered testimony, even if\ncredited, adds nothing to the analysis. By the government’s oun admission, Accuser-3 will not\ntestify, and the government cannot prove, that Accuser-3 Pe\neven if Accuser-3 testifies in accordance with the proffer, the government will be unable to\nestablish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity.“\n\nThe government argues that it “does not mater” whether Accuser-3 was an adult when\ninvited to travel (Opp. l62), because even evidence that she was invited to travel as an adult\nwould be “probative” of Ms. Maxwell’s “intent, in her initial interactions with [Accuser-3], to\nentice [Accuser-3] to travel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.” Opp.\nl63. But there is nothing unlawful about “entic[ing]” an adult to “travel and be transported for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual acts” if those acts themselves are entirely lawful. Nor does\nMs. Maxwell’s alleged role in Accuser-3’s purported lawful sexual activity with Epstein in\nEngland, while Accuser-3 was allegedly under age l8, evince an intent to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel before she turned l8.\n\n* In addressing the sufficiency of allegations in the similar context of a motion to dismiss, courts have recognized\nthat they are limited to consideration of the language of the indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Sharpe, 438 F.3d\nl257, l263 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (“a district court is limited to reviewing the face of the indictment’) (emphasis in\noriginal); United States v. Hit, 249 F.3d lolo, lol6 (D.C. Cir. 2ool) (“Adherence to the language of the indictment\nis essential because the Fifth Amendment requires that criminal prosecutions be limited to the unique allegations of\nthe indictments returned by the grand jury.”).\n* The government concedes that it cannot establish that Accuser-3\na Opp. l63 n.58 (admiting that Accuser-3 ls\n).\n“It bears mention that Accuser-3’s _ a _ to be uncorroborated \" ee evidence. =\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo422o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe government also improperly stretches the scope of the alleged conspiracies in a\nfailing atempt to make its allegations regarding Accuser-3 fit within those charges. For\nexample, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual\nactivity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements\nwith Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> for purposes of illegal sex acts.”\n(Opp. l62.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to\n“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an\nenticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to\nestablish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause\nminors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege\nthat Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.\n\nThe government commits a similar Freudian slip in its atempt to distinguish United\nStates v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), when it states that “the allegations regarding\n[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the conspiracy: grooming a minor\ngirl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. l64 n.59. The “heartland of the\nconspiracy” is actual or contemplated interstate travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful\nsexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The\ngovernment’s opposition repeatedly treats interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court\nJurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the necessary object of the conspiracies alleged, as a\nthrouaway element of its case.\n\nIn short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer\nestablish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (ll) travel while a minor.

Counts Five and Six\nof the S2 Indictment are therefore barred by the NPA.

The Court should also grant the other\nrelief Ms. Maxwell seeks for the reasons set forth belou.\n\nSUMMARY OF NEW ALLEGATIONS IN THE 82 INDICTMENT\n\nLike the Sl Indictment, Counts One and Three of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422,\n2423(a). Count One alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice “one and more individuals” to\ntravel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422. (S2 Indictment ff ll-l3).\nCount Three alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> “an individual” in interstate and\nforeign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Ud. 9¥ l6-l9). In the Sl Indictment, these\ncounts were based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997. The\nS2 Indictment expands the date range of these conspiracies into the 2ooos based on the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4273", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 9 of 32\nallegations of Accuser-4, alleging conduct that occurred “[f]rom at least in or about l994, up to\nand including in or about 2oo4.” (Ud. 4¥ ll, l7).\n\nThe S2 Indictment also adds two new counts—Counts Five and Six—alleging that Ms.\nMaxwell violated and conspired to violate the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\nCount Five alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein and others to recruit “a person”\nknouing that the person “had not atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex act” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a). Ud. §§ 23-24). Count Six charges Ms.\nMaxwell with a substantive violation of § l59l(a), claiming she “did recruit, entice, harbor,\n<span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>, provide, and obtain by any means” individuals who were under the age of l8,\nincluding Accuser-4, “who were then caused to engage in at least one commercial sex act with\nJeffrey Epstein.” (Ud. 27). Both counts are based on the allegations of Accuser-4 and allege\nconduct that purportedly occurred “[f]rom at least in or about 2ool, up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (Id. §§ 23, 27).\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The NPA Bars Ms. Maxwell’s Prosecution on Counts One, Three, Five, and Six.\n\nThe NPA bars any prosecution of Ms. Maxwell for the offenses charged in Counts One,\nThree, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment. The Court has already concluded that the NPA bars\nprosecution for “three specific categories of offenses” deriving from the Florida Investigation:\n\n(l) ‘the offenses set out on pages | and 2’ of the NPA; namely, ‘any offenses\n\nthat may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from\nin or around 2ool through in or around September 2oo7’ including five\nenumerated offenses:\n\n(2) ‘any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s\nOffice’; and\n(3) ‘any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation.’\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 32\ngovernment. (Dkt. 2o7 at 9-l3). Ms. Maxwell nevertheless preserves her argument and reasserts\nit with respect to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAs it existed in 2oo4, the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l, charged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment provided that “[w]hoever knouingly ... recruits,\nentices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person ... knouing that ... the\nperson has not atained the age of l8 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act”\nis guilty of acrime.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) (2oo4). Because the statute uses the phrase “will be\ncaused” before the phrase “to engage in a commercial sex act,” it is not necessary for the\ncommercial sex act to take place for the crime to be complete. See United States v. Garcia-\nGonzalez, 7l4 F.3d 3o6, 3l2 (5\" Cir. 2ol3) (“The future verb tense of the phrase ‘will be\ncaused’—which precedes ‘to engage in a commercial sex act’”—indicates that a sex act does not\nhave to occur to satisfy the elements of the child-sex-trafficking offense.”). For the reasons\nalready set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous motion, the statute of limitations in l8 U.S.C. §\n3283 does not govern l8 U.S.C. § l59l because the offense does not “necessarily entail” the\nsexual abuse of a minor and therefore is not an “offense involving” such conduct. Counts Five\nand Six must therefore be dismissed.\n\nIV. The Court Should Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as\n\nMultiplicitous.\n\nCount Five must also be dismissed along with either Count One or Count Three as\nmultiplicitous. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss\neither Count One or Count Three of the $l Indictment as multiplicitous because they charged the\nsame conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. (Dkt. l22, 2lo). Count Five of the S2 Indictment\ncharges Ms. Maxwell with yet another § 37l conspiracy from 2ool-2oo4 based on the\nallegations of Accuser-4. (S2 Indictment 9 22-25).

The Court Should Order the Government to Produce Accuser-4’s Prior Statements\nas Brady Material.\n\nAs explained above, it is apparent from the non-testifying witness material, which the\ngovernment produced just a few weeks ago on April l3, 2o2l, that Accuser-4 has only recently\nincluded Ms. Maxwell in her allegations of sexual abuse. In her summary of Accuser-4’s\nallegations that she gave to the SDFL grand jury on March l8, 2oo8, Special Agen i\nmade no mention of Ms. Maxwell, indicating that Accuser-4 never discussed Ms. Maxwell when\nthe FBI interviewed her in connection with the Florida Investigation.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo528l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 366 Filed lo/22/2l Page3of6\nto have to come back at all for the in-person questioning in this case and exactly what date and\ntime you would be obliged to be here.\n\nOnce that in-person questioning is completed, some of that group will be asked to return\nfor the last step in the jury selection, and some of that last group will be selected to serve on the\njury.\n\nThe trial in this case will begin on November 29 and we expect it to last approximately\nsix weeks. We will of course not sit on federal holidays, including Christmas Eve and Christmas\nand New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The questionnaire will explain the estimated\nschedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment.\n\nBut first, I want to tell you a litle bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal\ncase. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a\nformal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the\nGovernment’s burden at trial to establish a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis case is brought by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that\nis OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo53l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 367 _ Filed lo/22/2l Pagellof35\nJuror ID:\nCHARGES AND INDIVIDUALSINVOLVED,  ——S—Ss Commented [l3]: GOVERNMENT OBJECTION: The\n| Government objects to the “Charges & Individuals Involved” section\n= 7 - = - = - ; proposed by the defendant on the grounds that it is duplicative of the\nThe indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with Jeffrey Epstein and did\\| questions proposed by the Government.

Accordingly, evidence or arguments that\nthe victims consented to being trafficked, transported, enticed, or sexually exploited would not\ngive rise to a valid defense, and they should be precluded. See Elbert, 56l F.3d at 777-78\n(affirming exclusion of evidence of a victim’s consent under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2).

The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who Are Not\n\nWitnesses at Trial\n\nThe defendant does not appear to dispute the Government’s statement of the law: the\ncredibility of individuals who are neither witnesses nor hearsay declarants is not at issue and cannot\nbe challenged. (Def. Opp. at 43-45). The motion should therefore be granted.\n\nThe defense’s primary response is that they are not sure what statements will be elicited\nand the non-hearsay bases for such statements. Of course, the defense has had the Government’s\nwitness list and Jencks Act material for more than two weeks. Those materials make clear that the\nGovernment does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-\n6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent\nthe Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at\n45 (citing GX 78l-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered\nfor the truth of the mater asserted.\n\nInsofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging\nthe credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the\nmater asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the\ncredibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue. And the defense cannot\nchallenge the credibility of these individuals—in opening statements or otherwise—unless and\nuntil the defense seeks a ruling from the Court that the Government has opened the door.\n\nG. Evidence or Argument About the Minor Victims’ Consent is Categorically\n\nInadmissible\n\nThe defendant is charged with enticement of a minor, transporting a minor, sex trafficking\nof a minor, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. (See Indictment [J ll-27). None of those\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo559o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\nconspiracy to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses associated with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\nirrelevant, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F.

See Dkt. l46 at lo.!

In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited).

Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Proof of the Charged Conspiracies\n\nAccuser-3’s allegations, which pertain only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not\noffer any proof supporting those charges. The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment ff ll-l2); and (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. 9] l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. J l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity.

(discussing propensity evidence).\n\nA rape allegation is also highly emotional and inflammatory, much more so than the\nactual conduct charged in this case (sexualized massages). “Evidence shall be excluded as\nunduly prejudicial when it is ‘more inflammatory than the charged crime.’” United States v.\nMidyet, 6o3 F. Supp. 2d 45o, 456 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Livoti, l96 F.3d\n322, 326 (2d Cir. l999)); cf! United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d lo2, l33 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(affirming admission of evidence under Rule 4o3 when it was “no more inflammatory than the\ncharges alleged in the indictment”); United States v.

The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped Accuser-l. And Ms. Maxwell is not accused of conspiring to entice or <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors\nacross state lines so Mr. Epstein could allegedly rape them. Again, the alleged conspiracy in this\ncase is limited to securing ““sexualized massages” for Mr. Epstein. If jurors hear an allegation\nabout an alleged rape by Mr. Epstein, that evidence will confuse and mislead them, in addition to\nsuggesting that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.

(See generally Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l46). In response, the\nGovernment explained that the defendant and Epstein’s “interactions with Minor Victim-3 were\npart of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minor victims with the intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts,” and in any event, admissible under Rule 4o4(b) as evidence of the\ndefendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. (Gov’t Opp. at l57-l69, Dkt. No. 2o4). The\nGovernment expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in substance and in part, that she met the defendant\nwhen she was a.

No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v.

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5834", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8o of 84\n\nWitnesses may also reference “victims.” But the only witness the Government expects to\nuse the term “victim” is its expert, Dr. Rocchio. And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims. It notes,\nhouever, that “Accuser” is an alternative that is prejudicial to the Government.\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5863", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 52\n\"In assessing whether a district court properly admited other act evidence, we consider\n\nwhether (l) it was offered for a proper purpose; (2) it was relevant to a material issue in dispute;\n(3) its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect; and (4) the trial court\ngave an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury if so requested by the defendant.” United\nStates v.

Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity.

The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49.

This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

At that time, Atorney General William Barr said he initially had his oun suspicions\nabout Epstein’s death while detained at the MCC but came to conclude that Epstein’s death, an\napparent suicide, was the result of “a perfect storm of screw-ups.”!\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News, Barr stated he was “livid” when he learned that\nJeffrey Epstein had commited suicide and “happy that they had goten Ms. Maxwell.” ? When\nasked if the government had Maxwell's security “locked in” to ensure she would neither be able to\nkill herself or be harmed, Barr answered, with a mixture of laughter and a smile on his face: “Yes.\nWe have asked them to tell us specifically the protocols they're follouing, and we have a number\nof redundant systems to monitor the situation.” Id.

The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who Are Not\n\nWitnesses at Trial\n\nThe defendant does not appear to dispute the Government’s statement of the law: the\ncredibility of individuals who are neither witnesses nor hearsay declarants is not at issue and cannot\nbe challenged. (Def. Opp. at 43-45). The motion should therefore be granted.\n\nThe defense’s primary response is that they are not sure what statements will be elicited\nand the non-hearsay bases for such statements. Of course, the defense has had the Government’s\nwitness list and Jencks Act material for more than two weeks. Those materials make clear that the\nGovernment does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-\n6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent\nthe Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at\n45 (citing GX 78l-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered\nfor the truth of the mater asserted.\n\nInsofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging\nthe credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the\nmater asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the\ncredibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue. And the defense cannot\nchallenge the credibility of these individuals—in opening statements or otherwise—unless and\nuntil the defense seeks a ruling from the Court that the Government has opened the door.\n\nG. Evidence or Argument About the Minor Victims’ Consent is Categorically\n\nInadmissible\n\nThe defendant is charged with enticement of a minor, transporting a minor, sex trafficking\nof a minor, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. (See Indictment [J ll-27). None of those\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6552", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\nconspiracy to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses associated with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\nirrelevant, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F.

In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying?

Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Proof of the Charged Conspiracies\n\nAccuser-3’s allegations, which pertain only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not\noffer any proof supporting those charges. The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment 44 ll-l2); and (ll) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. J§ l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. 9§ l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the conspiracy” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6637", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 84\nbefriended Minor Victim-3 in London, England between approximately l994 and l995, including\nduring a period of time in which [the defendant] knew that Minor Victim-3 was under the age of\nl8.” (Indictment ¥ 9(c)). The defendant “introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and arranged for\nmultiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and Epstein,” during which the defendant\n“encouraged Minor Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knouing that Epstein would engage in sex acts\nwith Minor Victim-3 during those massages.” (/d.) Minor Victim-3 provided those massages,\nduring which Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. (/d.) Two overt acts in those Indictments\nconcemed the defendant and Epstein’s sexual abuse of Minor Victim-3 in London. (/d. ¥§ l3(d),\nl9(d)).\n\nThe defendant moved to strike the portions of the Sl Indictment involving Minor Victim-\n3, arguing that the events involving Minor Victim-3 were unrelated to the conspiracies charged in\nCount One and Count Three. (See generally Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l46). In response, the\nGovernment explained that the defendant and Epstein’s “interactions with Minor Victim-3 were\npart of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minor victims with the intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts,” and in any event, admissible under Rule 4o4(b) as evidence of the\ndefendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. (Gov’t Opp. at l57-l69, Dkt. No. 2o4). The\nGovernment expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in substance and in part, that she met the defendant\nwhen she was l7 years old. The defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 by, among other things,\ndiscussing Minor Victim-3’s life and family with Minor Victim-3.

No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v.

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8o of 84\n\nWitnesses may also reference “victims.” But the only witness the Government expects to\nuse the term “victim” is its expert, Dr. Rocchio. And Dr. Rocchio will not be testifying about the\ndefendant or the Minor Victims in this case, but about victims of sexual abuse generally.\nAccordingly, she is not vouching for the credibility of anyone in this case, or presuming anything\nabout the truth or falsity of any accusations.\n\nTo the extent other Government witnesses use the term “victim,” houever, it would not be\nprejudicial to the defense. The limitation on improper vouching applies to the prosecutor, not to\nGovernment witnesses, as even one of the defendant’s cases acknouledges. See Jackson v. State,\n6oo A.2d 2l, 25 (De. l99l) (“The opinion does not state, nor does it imply, that the use of the term\n‘victim’ by witnesses, as a term of art or in common parlance, is a basis for objection.”). In\nparticular, some of the witnesses who may use the word “victim” are the Minor Victims\nthemselves, who are testifying about their subjective experiences. It is not prejudicial to the\ndefense for someone who considers herself a victim to testify as much.”\n\nHere, as with other motions, the defendant requests an extraordinary order not seen in other\ncases in this District. That request lacks merit, and the Court should deny it.\n\nB. Evidence of Rape\n\nThe Government expects that at least one minor victim may describe being raped by Jeffrey\nEpstein. If that testimony is offered, it is directly relevant to issues before the jury. The defendant\nand Epstein are charged with transporting minors, enticing minors, or trafficking minors with the\n?? The Government defers to the Court on hou it would like to refer to the Minor Victims.

Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—treferred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n-4-\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 56 of l27 56\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl MS.

Count One alleges that\nMs. Maxwell conspired to entice \"one and more individuals” to travel in interstate and foreign\ncommerce to engage in \"sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense\" in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422.

Count Three alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> \"an individual\" in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in\n\"sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense\" in violation of l8\nU.S.C. § 2423(a). (Id. J l6-l9). Counts One and Three allege overt acts purportedly involving\nAccusers l, 2, and 4 and Witness-3.!\n\nCount Two of the S2 Indictment alleges enticement to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act, l8 U.S.C. § 2422. Count Four alleges transportation of a minor to\nengage in illegal sexual activity in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423. Counts Two and Four concern\nAccuser-l.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell violated and conspired\nto violate the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Count Five alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired with Epstein and others to recruit \"a person” knouing that the person \"had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act\" in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a). (id. 9] 23-24). Count Six charges Ms. Maxwell with a\nsubstantive violation of § l59l(a), claiming she \"did recruit, entice, harbor, <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>, provide,\n\n' Pursuant to the Court’s ruling at the November lo, 2o2l conference, we will refer to Accuser-3 as\n“Witness-3.” Houever, for ease of reference, we will refer to these four women collectively as the\n“Accusers.”\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo736o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page8ofl3\nPage 8\nthe defendant knew that, when she arranged for a young girl—such as Minor Victim-l or Minor\nVictim-4— to give Epstein a massage, that massage involved sexual contact.\n\nSecond, the evidence is relevant to the defendant’s motive. The Government expects the\ndefense to argue that the defendant had no reason to assist Epstein in obtaining sexualized\nmassages, especially from young girls. Minor Victim-3 will testify that\nee\nee\nee\nees\n\nThird, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is probative of her intent. “‘Where intent to\ncommit the crime charged is clearly at issue’—l.e., where it is an element of the crime—‘evidence\nof prior similar acts may be introduced to prove that intent.’” United States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr.\n5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (quoting United States v. Caputo,\n8o8 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. l987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange\nmassages were purely innocent conduct. See id. (“Prior act evidence is admissible to demonstrate\nintent ‘where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation.’” (quoting Zackson,\nl2 F.3d at ll82 (alterations omited))). Evidence of the defendant’s knouledge that massages\nwere sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice\nand <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors for the purpose of sexual contact. Minor Victim-3’s sexualized massages\nbegan around the time the conspiracy started, yet the massages continued—with the defendant’s\nactive involvement, as to Minor Victim-3 and other Minor Victims—for years. That is highly\nprobative evidence of her intent as to each of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. And\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony contains additional evidence of the defendant’s intent.

The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added). In so finding, the Court rejected all of the reasons\nthat the government offers (again) to admit this evidence as direct proof of the Mann Act\nconspiracies. The government has given the Court no reason to change its initial finding and it\nshould decline to do so.\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document556 - Filed l2/l9/2l Pagelof2\nU.S. Department of Justice\n—s United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” /d. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\ntransportation offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document566- Filed l2/28/2l Page/7of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See Gross, 2ol7 WL\n4685ll, at *2l (“After identifying the core of criminality, a court must then determine whether\nthe evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was\nnot convicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the\none alleged.” (citing D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9-2l)).\n\nCount Four of the Indictment, which was the subject of the Jury Note, charged Ms.\nMaxwell with the substantive offense of transporting an underaged individual in interstate\ncommerce with the intent that the individual engage in sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense. Ind. § 2l. The “to wit” clause of Count Four specified that the\nunderaged individual was Jane, the transportation in interstate commerce was Jane’s travel “from\nFlorida to New York, New York,” and the illegal sexual activity was a violation of New York\nPenal Law, Section l3o.55. Id.\n\nPursuant to the Court’s practice, the jurors were not given the Indictment. The jury\ncharge, which was given to the jury, included most, but not all, of these allegations. The jury\ncharge specified that Count Four related “solely to Jane” and instructed the jury that to convict\non this count, the government had to prove that (l) Ms. Maxwell knouingly transported Jane “in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment”; (2) Ms. Maxwell did so with the intent that\nJane would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55; and\n(3) Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was under the age of l7 years old.

The final step was for Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to normalize sexual\nsituations and sexual touching so that it would eventually escalate to more serious sexualized\nmassages. Tr. 285l:l8-2852:24.\n\nMoreover, this common method of operation to recruit and “groom” minors was all in\nservice of the same objective: to sexually abuse underage girls. Although this common scheme\nviolated three different statutes and the incidents of abuse took place in different locations, the\ngovernment’s theory as presented to the jury was that it was a single criminal agreement between\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell, not separate independent conspiracies.\n\nBe Common Overt Acts\n\nThe Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three alleged identical overt acts,\nwhich pertained to each of the four accusers. Ind. {J l3a-e and l9a-e. Because the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five did not involve Jane, Kate, or Annie Farmer, that\ncount alleged separate overt acts related solely to Carolyn. Ind. 4] 25a-d. As discussed above,\nhouever, Count Five was simply a subset of the larger conspiracy charged in Counts One and\nThree involving Carolyn and other accusers in Florida and did not represent a separate\nconspiracy. See discussion supra.\n\n4. Degree of Interdependence Between the Conspiracies\n\nThis factor requires the Court to consider the extent to which the success or failure of one\nalleged conspiracy is independent of a corresponding success or failure by the other. Macchia,\n35 F.3d at 67l. The conspiracy alleged in Count Three was logically dependent on the success\nof the conspiracy alleged in Count One. The object of both was to first entice and then <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\nminors across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. If the conspiracy\nto entice failed there would, logically, be no one to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>. Similarly, the object of the sex\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8953", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3o of 37\ntrafficking conspiracy was to “recruit, entice, harbor, <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>, provide, or obtain” a minor to\nengage in a commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn and others to\ngive sexualized massages to Epstein in exchange for cash, there would be no sex trafficking\ncount.\n\nFor these reasons, Counts One, Three, and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on\nonly one of these counts.\n\nIi. The Court Should Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Conviction and Dismiss the S2 Indictment\n\nDue to Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the\nIndictment due to the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution\nagainst Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due process rights. Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293). The Court denied the\nmotion each time on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell failed to shou “actual and substantial\nprejudice” caused by the delay. (Dkt. 2o7 at l6-l8; Dkt. 3l7 at lo). The Court, houever,\ngranted Ms. Maxwell leave to renew the motion after the conclusion of trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8;\nDkt. 3l7 at lo). Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts the same motion and incorporates the arguments\npreviously made to the Court.\n\nIn addition, the record at trial highlighted numerous other examples of hou the delay in\ncharging this case substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s defense. For example, critical\ndocumentary records and witnesses that would have alloued Ms. Maxwell to effectively\nchallenge the government’s proof were no longer available, including the follouing:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8954", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l3-l Filed o2/24/22 Page 3 of 3o\nJuror ID: AO |\n\nYour name will not be disclosed or connected to this questionnaire beyond the Judge and the\nparties in this case.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\n\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts’—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\n\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\n\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\n\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\n\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\n\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\n\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\n\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\n\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to engage |\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four |\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\n\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\n\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\n\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. |\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\n\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\n\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009567.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page5of5l\ndefendant enticed and transported Jane to New York with the intent that Jane engage in illegal\nsexual activity, and that the defendant conspired to do so regarding Jane and the other Minor\nVictims. That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\namendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive amendment occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive amendment.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat identified in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of5l\nfrom those alleged in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *3l. Reversal due to a\nvariance is appropriate only when the defendant can establish “that substantial prejudice occurred\nat trial as a result of the variance,” a shouing that cannot be made “where the pleading and the\nproof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of a character that could have misled the\ndefendant at trial, and where the variance is not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be\nprotected against another prosecution for the same offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294. “The\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly held that, so long as a defendant receives notice of the Government’s\ntheory of the case before trial, he is not prejudiced by a variance.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at\nra,\nB. Discussion\n\nNo constructive amendment or variance occurred in this case. The grand jury returned the\nS2 Indictment charging the defendant with knouingly transporting Jane with the intent that Jane\nengage in criminal sexual activity in New York, and aiding and abeting the same, and with\nconspiring to entice and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York. That is the core of criminality charged in the S2\nIndictment, and it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury\ninstructions.\n\nl. The Proof at Trial and Jury Instructions Captured the Core of Criminality\n\nThe defendant argues that the core of criminality for the Mann Act counts “was a scheme\nby Epstein and [the defendant] to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the\nintent that they would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.” (Def. Mot. at 9).\nThat is precisely the theory the Government advanced at trial. As the defendant correctly states,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9569", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009570.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page8of5l\n\nthe Government “consistently maintained that to convict [the defendant] on the Mann Act Counts\n(Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that [the defendant] enticed or caused\nunderaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same, with the intent that they would\nengage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law.” (Def. Mot. at l). The Government\nnever advanced a theory that the illegal sexual activity identified in the S2 Indictment was sexual\nactivity that occurred outside New York.\n\nAt trial, the Government marshalled evidence that the defendant knouingly transported\nJane to New York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so, with the intent that Jane engage in\ncriminal sexual activity there in violation of New York law. That evidence included testimony\nfrom Jane in detail about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr. 3l6-l9) and specific sexual acts that\ntook place in New York while Jane was a minor (Tr. 3l9-2o). As the defendant rightly concedes,\n“most of [Jane’s] trips were to New York” and “the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips\nconsisted of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced\nthere.” (Def. Mot. at l3). The Government also offered significant corroborating evidence,\nincluding flight records and photographs of Epstein’s New York residence. On the conspiracy\ncounts, the Government also offered evidence that the defendant and Epstein transported another\nvictim, Virginia Roberts, to New York while she was a minor. (See, e.g. Tr. l862 (describing a\nflight from 2ool in which Epstein, the defendant, and Virginia flew from Maine to Teterboro, New\nJersey)).\n\nThe Government’s summation similarly discussed the Mann Act offenses as encompassing\nconduct directed at New York. The Government explained that Count Two “is about Jane and\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo957o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page9of5l\nhou Maxwell and Epstein enticed her to . . . go across state lines to New York to be abused.” (Tr.\n2889 (emphasis added)). On that Count, the Government reminded the jury that “Jane told you\nabout traveling with Maxwell to New York,” and argued that “Jane didn’t end up in New York by\naccident.” (Tr. 2889-9o (emphasis added)). The Government also argued that the patern of Jane’s\nrelationship with the defendant and Epstein shoued that the defendant “enticed Jane to New York.”\n(Tr. 289o (emphasis added)). And the Government argued that the evidence shoued the defendant\n“absolutely intended that Jane would be abused in New York.” (Ud. (emphasis added)). The\nGovernment explained that Count Four differed from Count Two in that it involved travel, and not\nenticement to travel. So, the Government argued, the evidence shoued that “Jane was transported\nto New York,” and that the defendant was involved in making travel arrangements. (Tr. 289l\n(emphasis added)). The Government also made clear that, in order to shou a violation of New\nYork law, the Government did not have to shou “that abuse in New York actually happened,” so\nlong as the defendant had the requisite intent. (Tr. 2892 (emphasis added)). Accordingly, “[t]he\ncrime happened the moment [the defendant, Epstein, and Jane] crossed state lines,” and “to be\nvery clear, when Epstein flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that’s enough\ntoo.” (Ud. (emphasis added)). For the conspiracy counts, the Government referenced its earlier\ndiscussion of the elements of the substantive Mann Act offenses. And the Government argued\nthat, “even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused in New York . . . that is what [the\ndefendant and Epstein] both intended.” (Tr. 2895 (emphasis added); see Tr. 2895-96 (arguing that\nthe defendant “groomed Annie for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York.”\n(emphasis added))).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo957l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof5l\n\nThe Court’s Mann Act jury instructions also permited the jury to determine only whether\nthe defendant had intended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the conspiracy victims were\nintended to engage in sexual activity in New York. During trial, the Court granted defense requests\nfor limiting instructions at the time evidence came in to avoid the precise concern the defendant\nnou articulates. (Tr. ll67-68 (Kate); 2o48-49 (Annie)). See Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *27\n(explaining that the Court identified no case “in which the Second Circuit has ever found a\nconstructive amendment when a district court issued limiting instructions properly defining the\nscope of the alleged crime”). And at the conclusion of trial, the Court explained that Count Two\nalleged that the defendant “enticed Jane to travel across state lines with the intent that she would\nengage in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the penal law of\nNew York State.” (Tr. 3o34; see Tr. 3o3l (describing the third element of Count Two to require\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). Similarly, the Court\nexplained that Count Four alleged that the defendant knouingly transported Jane “‘with the intent\nthat Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in\nviolation of New York law.” (Tr. 3o37; see Tr. 3o35 (describing the second element of Count\nFour to require proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). For\nboth Counts, the Court specifically instructed the jury on one and only one predicate state offense:\na violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. (Tr. 3o34, 3o37). The instructions on Counts\nOne and Three incorporated this discussion of the elements of Counts Two and Four, and the only\nstatute the Court identified in its discussion of the relevant overt acts was New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. (Tr. 3o49-5o, 3o56-57).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9572", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof5l\n2. There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury Convicted The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive amendment or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and convicted\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat conclusion. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law. The jury was not informed of the age of consent in New Mexico or any\nparticular criminal statute in New Mexico. The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52). Such an instruction would have\nprovided the jury some state law to compare to the facts and determine whether it was violated,\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9573", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel3oof5l\nwhich gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.\n\nThe defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would\nhave occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced\nin New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence\nto satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a\nconstructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9575", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of5l\nconviction outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied\nby a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.\n\nb. The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009577.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of5l\n\nTwo. (Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no relevance.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its instruction directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “irrelevant,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that’s why precisely\nwe sent them back to the charge.” (Tr. 3l54).\n\nThe defendant renews her arguments nou, urging that the jury note shous that “the jurors\nhad the mistaken impression that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9577", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel7of5l\n\nThat fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about where the jury believed the sexual\nactivity occurred. It is not clear whether the flight on which the “intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the defendant suggests, or the return flight.\nIf it is the flight to New Mexico, it would still be probative evidence on Count Two, albeit not\nsufficient for conviction. If it is a flight from New Mexico, it would also still be probative and\nwould not pose any risk that the jury convicted based on conduct occurring in New Mexico. And\nif the jury thought that the defendant intended Jane to engage in sexual activity at the conclusion\nof a return flight from New Mexico to New York, it could well have been sufficient for conviction\non Count Two.\n\nThe issue is further confused by the uncertainty about the question posed by the jury. The\ndefendant understands the question to be about whether sexual activity in New Mexico is sufficient\nto find the defendant guilty. First, the jury’s question does not ask whether certain facts are\nsufficient for guilt; it asks whether the defendant “‘can be found guilty” ifa certain fact is true. The\ndefendant “can” be found guilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico, as\ndescribed above. That is a perfectly sensible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was repeatedly\nraised by defense counsel to the Court at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 3l49 (Court stating: “This is the same\ndiscussion we’ve had a couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in\nNew Mexico under the age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> to New York to engage\nin sexual activity under the age of l7, I think. I think this is the same basic discussion that we’ve\nhad. So... I think the proposal made by the defense is wrong.”). And second, the question\nspecifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury note may have been a question about\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9579", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 2oof5l\ndefendant based on an unsupported speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That is not plausible,\nand it certainly is not a “substantially likely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable\njury note.\n\nSecond, even if the jury was so confused, the Court’s response ameliorated that confusion.\nThe Court did not tell the jury that it could convict based solely on conduct occurring in New\nMexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the instruction that explained that the second element of\nCount Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent “that Jane engage in sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nLaw,” and further stated that “Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be\ncharged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” (Inst. No. 2l). The defendant\ndoes not argue that this instruction incorrectly states the law.* Nor does the instruction make any\nreference to New Mexico whatsoever, much less does it suggest that conviction is available if the\ndefendant intended to violate some New Mexican statute. The jury is presumed to have folloued\nthis instruction correctly. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (reciting the\n* The defendant complains that the jury instructions were “stripped of any mention of travel to\nNew York,” such as a limitation that the travel be “from Florida to New York.” (Def. Mot. at l-\n2, l5). The defendant tried to incorporate several limitations from the “to wit” clause of the\nIndictment into the jury charge, and the Court correctly rejected that atempt, because the\nGovernment is not strictly bound by facts in the “to wit” clause of an indictment. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 38 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“Such a discrepancy, houever, does not rise\nto the level of a constructive amendment because ‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense.”). For instance, if the jury had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from\nNew Mexico to New York with intent to violate New York law—which is one available reading\nof the jury note—that would be a permissible basis for conviction, but outside the limitations\nproposed by the defendant. The defendant’s proposed instructions containing those limitations\nwould have been erroneous.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 28 of5l\n\nl.

For example, in Villa, the district court concluded that, under\nthe first Korfant factor, two § 37l offenses were distinct, because the aim of one count was “‘to\ncommit theft from an interstate shipment and to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> stolen property across state lines,”\nwhereas the other conspiracy was “to sell stolen property.” Jd. Similarly, in United States v.\nSatar, Judge Koeltl concluded that two conspiracies charged under § 37l were distinct under\nKorfant, in part because the two counts “charge a separate conspiracy under the defraud clause\nand the offense clause of § 37l, respectively.” United States v.

First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 32 of5l\nwhich Kellen took nude photographs of Carolyn for Epstein. (Tr. l529). In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking conspiracy who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. Geographic Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking conspiracy which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on interstate commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines. (Tr. 3o4l-42). As a result, the conspiracy in Count Three was focused on travel to\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9594", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 49of5l\n2o8o-84 (shopping with Annie in New Mexico and teaching her to massage Epstein’s feet), 84o-\n45 (recruiting Virginia and instructing Alessi to bring her to Epstein’s Florida house), l524\n(Virginia receiving money for sex with Epstein), l534 (inviting Carolyn to travel)). The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”). That, in combination with evidence of the defendant’s participation in Jane’s\nabuse in New York, is sufficient on its oun for the jury to convict on Count Four. See United\nStates v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“The record is replete with evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that sexual access to Jaire was a dominant purpose of Vargas-\nCordon’s repeated <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> of her from his New Jersey home into Brooklyn.”); United States v.\nMi Sun Cho, 7l3 F.3d 7l6, 72o (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Cho does not dispute that one who arranges\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 5oof5l\nanother’s transportation across state lines for purposes of prostitution violates § 242l”); United\nStates v.

But the jury could also have\nconvicted the defendant by concluding that Epstein transported Jane, as he undoubtedly did by\ntransporting her on his private jet, and that the defendant aided and abeted that transportation by\ngrooming Jane, accompanying her on the plane, and participating in the abuse once she arrived in\nNew York.\n\nFinally, the record contains ample evidence for the jury to convict on Counts Five and Six.\nCarolyn’s testimony, corroborated by testimony from Shawn and physical evidence including\nmessage pads, shoued that the defendant knew that Carolyn was a minor and made phone calls to\narrange for Carolyn to engage in sex acts with Epstein in exchange for money. That is sufficient\nfor Count Six. And the evidence shoued that the defendant conspired with Epstein to traffic\nCarolyn and other minors for sex, including evidence that the defendant personally recruited\nVirginia while she was a minor. That is sufficient for Count Five.\n\nThe defense at trial focused largely on the credibility of the victims who testified against\nthe defendant. Nou that the jury has convicted on five counts, and in a posture in which the Court\nmust defer to the jury’s evaluation of the witnesses and take all inferences in favor of the\nGovernment, those arguments are not availing. The evidence at trial is more than sufficient to\nsustain the jury’s verdict.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page 7 of 22\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\n<span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8of24\nUnder the second element of Count Four, can the defendant be found guilty if the\ndefendant’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico and if\nthe defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nbut not the flight to New Mexico?\n\nHence, the question posed by the Jury Note contained two parts. The jury wanted to knou if it\nwas sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if it found (l) that Ms. Maxwell’s\nintent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell\nassisted with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not sufficient to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental instruction\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof necessary to satisfy Count Four. As\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s responsibility to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel6 of 24\nF.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous. The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,\nwhereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\nconsideration of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagelof45\nUSDCSDNY SS\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page3of 45\nDefendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims. Because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts. This\nlegal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury. Rather, it\nunderscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of\nconspiring with Epstein to entice, <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.\n\nI. The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.\n\nThe Defendant was indicted on six counts: (l) conspiracy to entice individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; (2) enticement of individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3)\nconspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce\nwith intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 37l; (4) transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in\nsexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8\nUS.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of\neighteen, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page /7 of 45\nB. Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment 7 l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment 4 l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.”\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment 9{ 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Id.\n423. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: The Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page8of45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\n<span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property’’).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. E.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo374", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page9of 45\n\n*ll (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire\nfraud were the same conspiracy as earlier conspiracy to use or transfer false IDs). After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a conspiracy to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. F.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an essential role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“Ta|lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free .... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.’’).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admited such testimony concerning\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel7 of 45\nFollouing the close of the defense case, the Defendant renewed her previous Rule 29\napplication. /d. at 2736.\n\nIn her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request that the Court “enter a judgment of\nacquital as to all counts.” Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel8 of 45\nof the acts alleged in Count Four; or that the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a reasonable doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Jd. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Id. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a commercial\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2o of 45\n\nFinally, Count Three charged the Defendant with conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> individuals\nunder the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. The Government was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the\nmembers of the conspiracy knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 3l9-2o.\nJane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel\ncomfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. Jd.\n299-3o3; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior touard her made her “feel\nspecial’).\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in\nNew York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she\nwas sixteen. /d. at 2o68-69, 2o75-77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein\ntook her shopping and to the movies. /d. at 2o8o-8l. She also testified that the Defendant\nEpstein in exchange for money. Trial Tr. l5l8-24. The Court concludes that the evidence related to Carolyn and\nVirginia was sufficient for the jury to convict the Defendant on Count Five.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 25 of 45\nl. The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s\nsummation captured the core of criminality.\n\nFirst, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence\ncaptured the core of criminality. As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with\nfour counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual\nknoun to be under the age of seventeen. Jury Charge at 24. The jury charge made clear that this\nprovision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four. See id. at\n23-24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had\nknouingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of\nNew York Penal Law Section l3o.55, as alleged in the Indictment). The Court also accepted the\nDefendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York\nlaw. See, e.g., Request to Charge at l9, 23, 26, 3o, 3l, Dkt. No. 4lo-l; Jury Charge at 2o, 24,\n26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an\nunspecified “criminal offense”).\n\nThe jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s\nassessment of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, Counts One and Three. The charge explained\nthat the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count\nTwo. See Jury Charge at 44-45. In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the\nenticement of minors to travel and the <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage\nin sexual activity illegal under New York law. See id. As for the overt acts, the Court, at the\nparties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment. Trial Tr. at 278l-82.\nRather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts. Jury Charge at 49-5o. For Counts One and\nThree, this included the instruction: “the Indictment alleges as follous: .. . (2) In or about l996,\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo39l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 26 of 45\nwhen Jane was under the age of l7, Jane was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for\npurposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in violation of New York Penal\nLaw, Section l3o.55.” Id. at 49.\n\nThe Court also gave two limiting instructions to ensure that the jury’s consideration of\ncertain relevant evidence was properly focused on the core of criminality. These instructions\npertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55. The first limiting instruction pertained to Kate. This instruction informed\nthe jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of\nKate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.\nat ll67-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\ninstruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\ninstruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\ncommercial flights. /d. at 3l6. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these\ntravel arrangements. /d. at 3l6-l7. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York\nand photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 32o.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with\nthe Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. /d. at 32l. In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo393", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt. D Amelio, 683 F.3d at 4l9; see also\nUnited States v. Jones, 847 F.

According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes.

The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\nresistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “massage.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at\nthe time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this mater\nand avoiding the trauma of testifying again. (Dkt. No. 574).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo542", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010569.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 34 of55\n\nAll three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of conviction is a “covered\nsex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4Bl.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter ll7 of Title l8 are\ncovered sex crimes); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter ll7). The defendant is neither a career\noffender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a patern of activity involving\nprohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New\nYork, a Chapter ll7 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s\nbreasts—which would be Chapter lo9A offenses had they occurred within the territorial\nJurisdiction of the United States. See l8 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2oo3) (defining “sexual\ncontact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any\nperson,” and criminalizing knouingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of\nl6). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, l8 F 4th 29o,\n3o3 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate\noccasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).\n\nThe defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on\nthese facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual\noffenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. ll-l4). The background commentary\nincorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at l4). This\nargument fails at each step.\n\nFirst, applying § 4Bl.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines\ncommentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual\noffenders from commiting further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the\nGuideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration\nfor offenders who engage in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo569", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page53oof55\n\nMoney is a key theme underlying the criminal conduct in this case. The defendant’s access\nto wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed\nshoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from\nstruggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled\nthe defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> victims and maintain the fabulous\nproperties where those victims were abused. That same wealth motivated the defendant to make\nsure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That\nwealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary privilege, and\nshe profited from her relationship with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small\nfinancial penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.\n\nThe defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is atempting\nto make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case. The defendant’s assets range in\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010760.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page 7 of 353\nJuror ID: g\n\nYour name will not be disclosed or connected to this questionnaire beyond the Judge and the\nparties in this case.

Like every other participant in a\nl8 multi-defendant case, Ms. Maxwell is being punished for the\n\nl9 role that she played in the criminal conduct. As to that role,\n2o the trial evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was\n2l instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls and that\n22 she herself participated in some of the abuse, and it is her\n23 conduct for which she has been convicted in the court under the\n24 laws of this country and it is her conduct for which she must\n25 be held accountable.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll6o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 36 of lo6 4o\nLBTCMAXK2 Opening - Ms. Pomerantz\n\nl Epstein's sexual abuse evolved over the course of a decade.\n\n2 You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of\n\n3 mentoring young girls, of promising them scholarships and\n\n4 opportunity, to introduce massage, inviting them on trips and\n\na transporting them across state lines, and that you will learn\n\n6 that they used these so called massages as a way to sexually\n\n7 abuse the victims.\n\n8 During that earlier phase, the defendant and Epstein\n\n9 had to find each girl individually themselves, but by the early\nlo 2ooos, the defendant and Epstein found an easier way to\n\nll maintain a continuous flou of girls to abuse. They were no\n\nl2 longer finding girls through the cover of scholarships and\n\nl3 opportunity. Instead, they devised a pyramid scheme of abuse,\nl4 a scheme that no longer required the defendant to personally\n\nl5 find young girls for Epstein.\n\nl6 So what did the defendant and Epstein do? They\n\nl7 encouraged girls to bring other girls. They asked the girls if\nl8 they had any young friends to bring over. And when a girl\n\nl9 brought someone new, she was rewarded with cash, extra cash on\n2o top of the hundreds of dollars she got for giving Epstein a\n2l sexualized massage. The defendant and Epstein handed hundred\n22 dollar bills to poor teenage girls in exchange for them giving\n23 Epstein so called massages. To be clear, those girls were not\n24 professional masseuses — they were kids being sexually\n25 exploited and abused.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll7ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 37 of lo6 Al\nLBTCMAXK2 Opening - Ms. Pomerantz\n\nl Under this pyramid scheme of abuse, the defendant\n\n2 could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand\n3 them cash afterwards, overseeing the operation and normalizing\n4 the abuse by shouing these young girls that she, an older,\n\nS purportedly respectable woman, had no problem with the paid sex\n6 acts that were taking place during these so called massages.\n\n7 For a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\n\n8 scheme.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the\n\n3 defense confuses conspiracy violations and substantive\n\n4 violations. There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 conspiracy count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting instruction for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the island.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the island.

You knou that Jane traveled\n2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you\n\n3 also knou it because Alessi told you about that. And you knou\n4 it because the flight records shou it too.\n\n5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager\nl2 to introduce her to the pilots until she got older.\n\nl3 But Jane is listed on several flights in these\n\nl4 records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's\n\nl5 November l996, when Jane was just l6 years old. Here she is on\nl6 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight.

The crime is transporting\n5 Jane with the intent that she will be abused.\n\n6 Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange\n7 travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell\n8 knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what\n\n9 Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment\nlo they crossed state lines.

Ladies and gentlemen, Carolyn was a\nal l4-year-old girl. She came to the house over and over again\n22 and interacted with Maxwell. She talked about her home life,\n23 she told Maxwell she was too young to travel, that her mother\n24 wouldn't let her go on trips. She was a girl who had just\n25 dropped out of middle school.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result\nin a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance\nfrom, the Allegations in the Indictment\n\nDuring jury deliberations, the jury sent the follouing jury note\nregarding Count Four of the Indictment:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the\ntransportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to\nNew Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second\nelement?*\n\nThe District Court determined that it would not respond to the note\ndirectly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and\ninstead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.*6\n%4 Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 5o rather than allouing the parties to\ndo so.

There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 conspiracy count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting instruction for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the island.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the island.

You knou that Jane traveled\n2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you\n\n3 also knou it because Alessi told you about that. And you knou\n4 it because the flight records shou it too.\n\n5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager\nl2 to introduce her to the pilots until she got older.\n\nl3 But Jane is listed on several flights in these\n\nl4 records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's\n\nl5 November l996, when Jane was just l6 years old. Here she is on\nl6 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight.

Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein,\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9866", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019868.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN IOSdtuUM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P ahageb26ioLo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (Government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be\npresumed, subject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure\nthe appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every\none of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel\nstrongly in favor of detention.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9868", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019898.jpg": "Case 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DStamtePl &Pitdd BPFH Page 2a S2o\n\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019946.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page87 of 2oo P|\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl legal presumption that there are no conditions that could\n\n2 reasonably assure her return to court and, your Honor, the\n\n3 defendant has not come anywhere close to rebuting that\n\n4 presumption.\n\n5 Turning first to the nature and seriousness of the\n\n6 offense and the strength of the evidence, the indictment in\n\n7 this case arises from the defendant's role in transporting\n\n8 minors for unlawful sexual activity and enticing minors to\n\n9 travel to engage in unlawful sexual active and participating in\nlo a conspiracy to do the same.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2.

The indictment is timely\n\nA. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations\n\nFederal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. l8\nU.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,\nCongress has provided a longer limitations period for “offense[s] involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping” of a minor. l8 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2oo3, the operative version\nof § 3283 alloued prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five.\nCongress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2oo3, Pub. L. No. lo8-\n2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, to allou prosecution any time during the life of the victim.\n\nThe parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act,\nbut untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2oo3\nversion of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the\ngeneral statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2oo3 version of § 3283\napplies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2oo3. The Court concludes that statute of\nlimitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely.\n\nl. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors\n\nMaxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the Sl superseding indictment involve\nthe sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the\nalleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for\nthat purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses\ninvolving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view,\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020769.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020825.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page2o7 of 2o8\n3o35\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the\n2 victim's age, you must find that Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was\n3 less than l7 years old.\n\n4 Instruction No. l8.

Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in\n2l interstate commerce. That means that the government must prove\n22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be\n23 transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate\n24 commerce.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to request that the Court give the jury additional\ninstructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the\nlaw applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court\nExhibit #l5).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 reads, in relevant part, as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), [l]f the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nCount Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida\nto New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would engage in one\nor more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” S82\nInd. ¥ 2l (emphasis added).\n\nIn response to the note, the Court referred the jury to Instruction No. 2l of the jury charge.\nThe defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020851.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page25 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Jd. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\ntransportation offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported.\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” $2 Ind. | 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o85l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020855.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page29 of 22l\nA-229\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 7 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020986.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel6o of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 3 of 45\nDefendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims. Because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts. This\nlegal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury. Rather, it\nunderscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of\nconspiring with Epstein to entice, <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.\nI. The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.\n\nThe Defendant was indicted on six counts: (l) conspiracy to entice individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; (2) enticement of individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3)\nconspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce\nwith intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 37l; (4) transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in\nsexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of\neighteen, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o986", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020990.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel64 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 7 of 45\nB. Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment §f] l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment | l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.*\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment {| 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Jd.\n4] 23. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: ae Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020991.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel65 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 8 of 45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\n<span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects interstate commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an interstate\nshipment and to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. F.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020992.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel66 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 9 of 45\n\n*ll (concluding that conspiracies to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire\nfraud were the same conspiracy as earlier conspiracy to use or transfer false IDs). After all, “[a]\nsingle agreement to commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 57o-7l (l989). The Government implicitly conceded this point of law when it\nagreed that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous. Count One charges a conspiracy to\nentice minors to travel across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 while Count Three\ncharges a conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors across state lines in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a).\nDespite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 37l conspiracies, the Government did not\ncontest that they were the same offense. Though Count Five is unquestionably less similar to\nCount Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the mater. It\nis well established that a single conspiracy can contain multiple objectives, particularly if the\nobjectives share important similarities, as they do here. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88,\nl48 (2d Cir. l998) (citing United States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d l5l2, l5l8 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nOverlap of participants. The participants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and\nFive substantially overlap with one another. Of course, the defendant will always overlap\nbetween two allegedly multiplicitous conspiracies, so their participation in both conspiracies has\nnegligible significance. Villa, 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *5. More importantly here, Epstein was the\nDefendant’s primary coconspirator in both conspiracies, and the Government argued that in both\nconspiracies the Defendant played the same role of acquiring underage girls for Epstein to\nsexually abuse. They were, the Government explained, “partners in crime” over the decade\nalleged in the Indictment. E.g., Trial Tr. at 34, 2842, 2885; see also id. at 4l (“For a decade, the\ndefendant played an essential role in this scheme.”). This overlap in key participants, and in core\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o992", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020996.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7/o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“[allmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free.... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.”).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admited such testimony concerning\n\nIs\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o996", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021000.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel74 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l7 of 45\nFollouing the close of the defense case, the Defendant renewed her previous Rule 29\napplication. /d. at 2736.\n\nIn her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request that the Court “enter a judgment of\nacquital as to all counts.” Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\ninterstate commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2looo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021001.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7/5 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l8 of 45\nof the acts alleged in Count Four; or that the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge\nat 26, 37.\n\nThe Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the Defendant\nguilty of Count Four beyond a reasonable doubt. Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in\nsexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 3o5. She\nthen began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same\nage. Id. at 3l5-l6. Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private\njet. Jd. at 3l6. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that\nthe Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. /d. at 3l6-l7. On\none occasion when she was fifteen, Jane recounted, she had trouble geting on a commercial\nflight because she did not have proper identification. Houever, the Defendant “made it happen”\nfor her by making a call and helping her get on the flight. /d. at 323-24. Jane also testified that\nthe Defendant was present on some occasions when Epstein sexually abused Jane in New York\nwhen she was under the age of seventeen. /d. at 32o. The Court concludes that this evidence,\ntaken together, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\nknouingly transported Jane to New York with the intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, or at minimum, aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.\n\nNext, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the\nDefendant guilty of Count Six. Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021003.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7/7 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 2o of 45\n\nFinally, Count Three charged the Defendant with conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> individuals\nunder the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. The Government was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the\nmembers of the conspiracy knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 3l9-2o.\nJane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel\ncomfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. /d.\n299-3o3; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior touard her made her “feel\nspecial”).\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in\nNew York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she\nwas sixteen. /d. at 2o68-69, 2o75-77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein\ntook her shopping and to the movies. /d. at 2o8o-8l. She also testified that the Defendant\nEpstein in exchange for money. Trial Tr. l5l8-24. The Court concludes that the evidence related to Carolyn and\nVirginia was sufficient for the jury to convict the Defendant on Count Five.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021004.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel/78 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\n\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIll. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021008.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel82 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 25 of 45\nl. The Court’s instructions, the evidence at trial, and the Government’s\nsummation captured the core of criminality.\n\nFirst, the Court’s instructions to the jury during trial and after the close of evidence\ncaptured the core of criminality. As explained above, the Indictment charged the Defendant with\nfour counts in violation of the Mann Act, each predicated on a violation of New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55. That provision of New York law criminalizes sexual contact with an individual\nknoun to be under the age of seventeen. Jury Charge at 24. The jury charge made clear that this\nprovision of New York law served as the predicate offense for Counts Two and Four. See id. at\n23-24 (Count Two), 28 (Count Four, instructing the jury to decide whether the Defendant had\nknouingly transported Jane with the intent to engage in sexual activity with Jane in violation of\nNew York Penal Law Section l3o.55, as alleged in the Indictment). The Court also accepted the\nDefendant’s requested edits that further clarified that the predicate state offense was New York\nlaw. See, e.g., Request to Charge at l9, 23, 26, 3o, 3l, Dkt. No. 4lo-l; Jury Charge at 2o, 24,\n26, 28 (specifying, e.g., that the predicate state offense was “New York law,” rather than an\nunspecified “criminal offense’’).\n\nThe jury charge also clearly instructed on the role of New York law in the jury’s\nassessment of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, Counts One and Three. The charge explained\nthat the object of the conspiracies was a violation of the same New York law at issue in Count\nTwo. See Jury Charge at 44-45. In particular, the objects of Counts One and Three were the\nenticement of minors to travel and the <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> of minors, respectively, with the intent to engage\nin sexual activity illegal under New York law. See id. As for the overt acts, the Court, at the\nparties’ request, did not provide the jury with a copy of the Indictment. Trial Tr. at 278l-82.\nRather, the charge specified the relevant overt acts. Jury Charge at 49-5o. For Counts One and\nThree, this included the instruction: “the Indictment alleges as follous: .. . (2) In or about l996,\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021009.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel83 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 26 of 45\nwhen Jane was under the age of l7, Jane was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for\npurposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in violation of New York Penal\nLaw, Section l3o.55.” Jd. at 49.\n\nThe Court also gave two limiting instructions to ensure that the jury’s consideration of\ncertain relevant evidence was properly focused on the core of criminality. These instructions\npertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55. The first limiting instruction pertained to Kate. This instruction informed.\nthe jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of\nKate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.\nat ll67-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\ninstruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\ninstruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021010.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel84 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 27 of 45\nYork. Maxwell Reply at 5. The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and\nEpstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in\nFlorida. Trial Tr. at 293-95, 3o5-o6. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant\nwhen she was fourteen years old. /d. at 3l5. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane’s\ntestimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in\nNew York. Maxwell Br. at l3. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o. She explained\nthat while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein’s private plane, she also took\ncommercial flights. /d. at 3l6.

In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law.

To accomplish this, the Government relies on § 3283’s\nextension of the limitations period.

Transportation of a minor or conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> in violation of\n§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed.\n\nAt first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and\nFour do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a child.” But\nlongstanding legal precedent dictates a narrouer application of § 3283. The\nSupreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “essential\ningredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021106.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Paged9 of ll3\ncrimes. Under this approach, a court “look[s] to the statute defining the crime of\nconviction, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.” Kawashima v.\nHolder, 565 U.S. 478, 483 (2ol2); see also U.S. v. Taylor, l42 S.Ct. 2ol5, 2o2o\n(2o22) (the categorical approach asks only what the Government is required “‘to\nprove—beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case,” and “precludes...an\ninquiry into hou any particular defendant may commit the crime’).\n\nHere, applying the categorical approach to § 3283 means holding that this\nprovision is inapplicable here. That is because “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping, of a child” is not a required element of transporting minors in violation\nof § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same. l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a). The offense is\naccomplished once a person “transports” a minor with the requisite knouledge and\nintent; “[t]he government need not prove ... that the unlawful sexual activity\nactually took place.” U.S. v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2ol3).\nThus, Counts Three and Four should have been dismissed.\n\nHouever, to save Counts Three and Four from dismissal, the court rejected\nthis categorical approach altogether and opted instead for a “case-specific” one,\nwhich would permit it to examine whether this particular defendant’s alleged\nconduct “involve[ed] the sexual or physical abuse...of a child.” In so doing, the\ncourt brushed aside the clear weight of authority, which holds that statutes\nemploying “offense...involves” or “offense...involving” language identical to §\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2llo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021137.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page9o of ll3\nA238\n\nThe second element of Count Four in the Jury Charge to which the jury\nplainly refers requires “that Maxwell knouingly transported Jane in interstate\ncommerce with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,”\nnamely, “New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55, sexual abuse in the third\ndegree.” Tr. 3o37:lo-l9\n\nB.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers.

Counts Three and Four Are Offenses\nInvolving the Sexual Abuse of a\nChild\n\nMaxwell’s entire argument is based on a mistaken\npremise: that the phrase “offense involving the sexual\n... abuse ... of a child,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, only encom-\npasses crimes in which “unlawful sexual activity actu-\nally took place.” (Br.44). This flawed proposition ig-\nnores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear\nthat Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include of-\nfenses in which there was no completed illegal sex act.\n\nAs described above, Section 3283 was originally\ncodified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the\nterm “sexual abuse” is located within that same sec-\ntion:\n\nFor purposes of this section ... the term\n‘sexual abuse’ includes the employment,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement,\n\nll Maxwell raises no analogous argument with re-\nspect to Count Six, which charges sex trafficking of a\nminor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021706.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page59 of 93\n46\n\n“induce[]” a child to engage in illegal sexual activity\nby transporting the minor across state lines with in-\ntent that the child engage in an illegal sex act, l8\nU.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8), and Count Three, as a conspiracy\nto commit Count Four, is an “offense involving [such]\nsexual ... abuse,” id. § 3283.

That is the issue Judge\nNathan instructed the jury to resolve, and that is the\ncriminal conduct charged in Counts Three and Four of\nthe Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive amend-\nment or variance occurred.\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nCounts Three and Four charged Maxwell with ar-\nranging for Jane’s transportation to New York with\nthe intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Ep-\nstein, in violation of New York state law, and with a\nconspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors to New York for the\nsame purpose. (A.l27-3o). At trial, the Government\nmarshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to\nNew York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so,\nwith the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity\nthere. That evidence included detailed testimony from\nJane about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr.3l6-l9)\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l726", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021727.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page8o of 93\n67\nand specific sexual acts that took place in New York\nwhile Jane was a minor (Tr.3l9-2o).\n\nThe Government’s summation similarly discussed\nthese charges as encompassing conduct directed at\nNew York. As to Count Four, the Government argued\nthe evidence shoued “Jane was transported to New\nYork,” and Maxwell was involved in making travel ar-\nrangements. (Tr.289l (emphasis added)). The Govern-\nment also clarified that “[t]he crime happened the mo-\nment [Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane] crossed state\nlines,” and “to be very clear, when Epstein flew Jane to\nNew York and Maxwell aided and abeted him, that’s\nenough too.” Ud. (emphasis added)). For the conspiracy\ncounts, the Government referenced its earlier discus-\nsion of the elements of the substantive offenses. And\nthe Government argued that, “even though Carolyn\nand Annie were not sexually abused in New York...\nthat is what [Maxwell and Epstein] both intended.”\n(Tr.2895 (emphasis added); see Tr.2895-96 (arguing\nthat Maxwell “groomed Annie for abuse after she had\nalready visited Epstein in New York.” (emphasis\nadded))).\n\nThe District Court’s jury instructions also permit-\nted the jury to determine only whether Maxwell had\nintended that Jane (for the substantive counts) or the\nconspiracy victims engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. During trial, Judge Nathan granted defense re-\nquests for limiting instructions at the time evidence\ncame in to make clear that the charges focused on the\nintent that sexual activity take place in New York.\n(Tr.ll67-68 (Kate), 2o48-49 (Annie)). At the conclusion\nof trial, Judge Nathan instructed the jury that Count\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l727", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021728.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page8l of 93\n68\n\nFour alleged that Maxwell knouingly transported\nJane “with the intent that Jane engage in sexual ac-\ntivity for which any person can be charged with a crim-\ninal offense in violation of New York law.” (Tr.3o37;\nsee Tr.3o35 (second element of Count Four requires\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged\nin the indictment”)). Judge Nathan also instructed the\njury on one and only one predicate state offense: a vio-\nlation of N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o34, 3o37). The\ninstructions on Count Three incorporated this discus-\nsion of the elements of Count Four, and the only stat-\nute identified was N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o49-\n5o, 3o56-57).\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing\n\nnote:\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided\nin the transportation of Jane’s return\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico\nwhere/if the intent was for Jane to en-\ngage in sexual activity, can she be found\nguilty under the second element?\n(Tr.3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the\nconclusion of which Judge Nathan determined she\nshould refer the jury back to the jury charge on the\nsecond element of Count Four because the jury note\nwas otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-\ngally.” (Tr.3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, Maxwell filed a leter seeking reconsid-\neration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the\npossibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial\nvariance because, in her view, the note shoued that\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l728", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021729.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page82 of 93\n69\n\nthe jury might convict based on Jane’s testimony that\nshe was abused in New Mexico. (A.224-25). Maxwell\nasked Judge Nathan to instruct the jury as to the in-\ntent elements of Counts Two and Four, and add that\n“[ajln intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any\nstate other than New York cannot form the basis of\nthese two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (A.229).\n\nJudge Nathan rejected Maxwell’s request both be-\ncause the jury did not inquire about Count Two and\nbecause the final sentence as “just wrong” in suggest-\ning that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity\noutside of New York “may have no relevance.”\n(Tr.3l49). As Judge Nathan explained, “This is the\nsame discussion we've had a couple of times .... Sex-\nual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under\nthe age of l7 can be relevant to an intent to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span>\nto New York to engage in sexual activity under the age\nof l7....” (Tr.3l49-5o). Judge Nathan repeated that\nshe did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question ex-\nactly,” but that her instruction directing the jury to the\noriginal charge included a reminder that “it’s a viola-\ntion of New York penal law that’s charged and is the\nillegal sexual activity that theyre considering.”\n(Tr.3l5o). Judge Nathan also pointed out that Max-\nwell did not “seek to exclude” Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, or “seek a limiting instruction with re-\nspect to that testimony.” (Tr.3l53). Judge Nathan\nadded “I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking\nor many other plausible readings,” noted that the de-\nfense had proposed an “incorrect” instruction, and con-\ncluded no more was required than sending the jury\n“back to the charge.” (Tr.3l54).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l729", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021731.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page84 of 93\n7l\n\nalleged in the indictment.” United States v.

Dove, 884 F.3d\nat l46, l49.\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThere is no likelihood—much less a substantial\nlikelihood—that the jury convicted Maxwell solely be-\ncause Jane was transported to New Mexico. At no\npoint during the trial, including its summation, did the\nGovernment argue that the jury could convict on a the-\nory that Maxwell intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico. Similarly, the District Court’s charge required\nthe jury to decide whether Maxwell intended to violate\nNew York law. The trial contained no instructions de-\nscribing for the jury any particular criminal statute in\nNew Mexico, or any other basis by which a jury could\nconvict based on conduct in New Mexico.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l73l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021734.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page87 of 93\n74\n\nprostitution must be a “significant or motivating pur-\npose” of the interstate transportation). Maxwell only\ncame to the theory she nou advances after a lengthy\ndiscussion spanning ten pages of the transcript.\n(A.387). And that reading is far from clear: the jury’s\nquestion does not ask whether certain facts are suffi-\ncient for guilt; it asks whether Maxwell “can be found\nguilty” if a certain fact is true. Maxwell “can” be found\nguilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in\nNew Mexico, which is probative of Maxwell’s intent\nand role in transporting Jane. That is a perfectly sen-\nsible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was re-\npeatedly raised by defense counsel to Judge Nathan at\ntrial. (See, e.g., Tr.3l49).\n\nSeting aside the jury note, Maxwell’s position re-\nquires the jury to have reached a series of odd conclu-\nsions. Jane testified at length about her travel to New\nYork and the ensuing sexual abuse there. It would\nmake litle sense for the jury to reject that testimony,\nand then conclude that Maxwell arranged the uniden-\ntified commercial return flight Maxwell nou empha-\nsizes, for which there is no documentary evidence in\nthe record, including no specific corroboration of Max-\nwell’s role in arranging that flight. (Compare Br.79-8o\n(“[T]he jury likely believed that if they found Maxwell\nhad some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken\nplace, they could convict her on the substantive trans-\nportation count ....”) with Tr.3l33 (defense argument\nthat there is “no evidence” Maxwell arranged a return\nflight from New Mexico)). Maxwell suggests that the\njury thought the flight records to be critical evidence,\nbut the flight logs also demonstrate that Jane was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l734", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021735.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page88 of 93\n75\n\nfloun to New York on Epstein’s private jet, corroborat-\ning her testimony on that point. (See Br.79 (citing GX-\n662-R at 44)). The same is true regarding Maxwell’s\ncomparison of Counts Two and Four: in Maxwell’s\nview, the jury rejected nearly all of the evidence of\nMaxwell’s enticement of Jane to New York for lack of\ncorroboration, and then convicted her based on an un-\nsupported speculative leap about arranging an uni-\ndentified return flight from New Mexico. That is not\nplausible, and it certainly is not a “substantially\nlikely” conclusion that can be drawn from an inscruta-\nble jury note.\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred. As dis-\ncussed above, the proof at trial corresponded to the al-\nlegations in the Indictment, namely, evidence and ar-\ngument that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to\nNew York in order to facilitate sexual abuse there.\nMaxwell was also well aware that the Government’s\nproof would include conduct in New Mexico. (See\nA.ll7, l2l-22, l26). Maxwell therefore had “fair and\nadequate notice” that the conspiracies included con-\nduct at Epstein’s New Mexico home, which is all that\nis required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8,\n622 (2d Cir. 2oo3). In any event, the Government pro-\nduced on November 6, 2o2l—more than three weeks\nbefore trial—notes from an interview with Jane de-\nscribing sexual abuse in New Mexico. That is suffi-\ncient.

Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase.

In Landgraf v.

We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o.

Count\nThree charged Maxwell with conspiracy to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> minors with intent to engage in\ncriminal sexual activity, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charged Maxwell with\ntransportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, in violation of l8\nU.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2.

We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor. Counts Three and Four thus qualify as offenses, and § 3283\napplies to those offenses.\n\nSecond, Maxwell argues that Counts Three, Four, and Six of the\nIndictment are barred by the statute of limitations because the\nextended statute of limitations provided by the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not apply to pre-enactment conduct. In Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, the Supreme Court held that a court, in deciding\nwhether a statute applies retroactively, must first “determine whether\nCongress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” If\nCongress has done so, “the inquiry ends, and the court enforces the\n2 The “categorical approach” is a method of statutory interpretation that requires courts to\nlook “only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions” for sentencing and immigration purposes. Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 6oo (l99o). We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o. Second,\nlegislative history suggests that Congress intended § 3283 to be applied broadly.

The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did Not Result\nin a Constructive Amendment of, or Prejudicial Variance\nfrom, the Allegations in the Indictment\n\nDuring jury deliberations, the jury sent the follouing jury note\nregarding Count Four of the Indictment:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the\ntransportation of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to\nNew Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in\nsexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second\nelement?*\n\nThe District Court determined that it would not respond to the note\ndirectly because it was difficult to “parse factually and legally” and\ninstead referred the jury to the second element of Count Four.*6\n%4 Nor did the District Court err in questioning Juror 5o rather than allouing the parties to\ndo so.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.jpg": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that ““we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n255 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\n| Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to\nReceiving and Discharge as “WAB\"” and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have\nbeen notified. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his\nshift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed. The OIG’s\ninvestigation revealed, houever, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of\nthe USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC\nNew York on August 9. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have\nknoun that Epstein was without a cell mate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the\nSHU tiers during the round. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he believed that if the Evening\nWatch Acting Activities Lieutenant knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate, she would have notified him.\nBoth the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the\nOIG that they were unaware that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities\nLieutenant, who was serving in this position on August 9 from approximately 4 p.m. until lo p.m., told the\nOIG that because her ordinary position was a Senior Officer Specialist, she was not aware that Epstein was\nrequired to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant recalled hearing that Epstein\nhad been placed on suicide watch, but said she never received specific instructions regarding Epstein. She\nsaid the SHU staff did not tell her about the requirement that Epstein have a cellmate or that his cellmate\n\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23423", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023439.jpg": "and then she heard Thomas rip something. Noel said she observed Thomas lifting Epstein from under his\narms and dragging him back out of the corner of the cell and laid him doun on the ground to perform CPR.\nAccording to Noel, within seconds of Thomas calling out for the cuter she hit the body alarm, which is a\nbuton on an MCC staff member's radio that is used to signal distress or an emergency. Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier. Noel said she was alone\nin the SHU for 2o minutes after they left with Epstein and she kept calling the Control Center to get\nstatus updates.\nNoel told the OIG that Epstein’s cell was approximately l5 feet from the SHU Officers’ Station. Noel said she\nwould have knoun if someone went in or out of Epstein’s cell overnight and no one did. She also said that\nthere was no indication that any of the inmates could have goten out of their cells. Noel said she never\nslept during her shift on August 9-lo, 2ol9. Noel said that when she is seen on the camera at the desk not\nmoving, she was on the computer. Noel then clarified by saying that she worked 5 days of overtime leading\nup to her shift, so she would begin to doze off; houever, she caught herself and never slept.\nThe Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant who relieved the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 5:3o a.m. The Lieutenant said that at\napproximately 6:33 a.m., he heard a call for a medical emergency in the SHU and immediately responded to\nthe alarm. When he arrived, Noel told him, “Epstein hung himself.” Once inside, the Lieutenant observed\nthat Thomas was performing CPR on Epstein. The Lieutenant stated that he asked, “Where's his bunkie at?”\nand that Noel responded, in substance, that Epstein did not have a cellmate. Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds. We messed up.” The\nLieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an AED and call for the duty nurse.\nThe MCC New York Electronics Technician told the OIG that he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m.\nWhen the Electronics Technician first arrived in the SHU, Thomas and other MCC New York staff members\nwere picking Epstein up and placing him on a stretcher. The Electronics Technician said he and Senior\nOfficer Specialist 6 performed chest compressions on Epstein while he was on the stretcher and being\ntransported to the Health Services Unit on the second floor.*? The Electronics Technician stated that he\n42 Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff\nand Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies,\nand allous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because COs can directly escort EMTs to\nthe Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and\nuntil approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said\nhe delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same\non another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food\nto the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU\nOfficers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs shou, among other things, Epstein on his back with an\nintravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him\nwearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York shou Epstein in\na hospital goun, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital which shou Epstein in a hospital goun.\nAdditionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at\nthe time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of\nsight to Epstein’s cell.44 One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from\nEpstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side\nof L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, a litle before l2 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.\nInmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning\nof August lo prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August lo. Inmate 5 said the male\nCO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see\nEpstein’s legs from the knee doun but could tell that Epstein was laying doun on his back because his feet\nwere pointed upward. The male CO bent doun to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The\nmale CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said\nboth the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said\nthat once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest\ncompressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the\nfemale CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the buton. The female officer said,\n“Yeah, a long time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to\n“8 As noted previously, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the\ninmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.\n\n73\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2344o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023442.jpg": "defibrillator. Inmate 6 did not see marks on Epstein’s neck but did see bruising on his face and observed\nearphones that were still in place on Epstein’s ears.\nInmate 7, who was two cells doun from Epstein’s cell and on the other side of the tier, told the OIG that he\ncould not see into Epstein’s cell but he could see the cell door. Inmate 7 said that after dinner was brought\nto Epstein’s cell on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, Inmate 7 did not recall seeing anyone going in or out of\nEpstein’s cell until the follouing morning at around 6 a.m. He further stated that he did not hear any door\n“pop open” that evening. Inmate 7 said he remembered waking up around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and\nhearing a voice, possibly male, saying “Breathe.” Inmate 7 said he saw Epstein removed from his cell on\na stretcher.\nIn addition, the OIG and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed seven inmates assigned to\nother tiers in the SHU, none of whom had any direct knouledge of hou Epstein died. These inmates\nconsistently reported that the SHU officers did not systematically conduct the counts and rounds as\nrequired on the evening Epstein died and that the last round was either between 9:3o-lo p.m. or l2:3o-\nla.m. Several inmates told the OIG that before Epstein died the SHU staff never conducted rounds at night.\nAccording to the BOP Form 583 Report of Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while\ndelivering the breakfast meal, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Consistent with the required\nresponse to a suspected suicide outlined in the MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders that are\ndescribed in Chapter 2, staff called for assistance and began life-saving measures. At 6:39 a.m., Epstein\nwas taken to the MCC New York Health Services Unit, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived to MCC\nNew York at 6:43 a.m. Epstein was transported to the local hospital, New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital, at 7:lo a.m., and was pronounced deceased at 7:36 a.m.\nAccording to a memorandum atached to the Form 583 from the Clinical Nurse dated August lo, 2ol9, when\nthe medical emergency involving Epstein was called over the radio, the Clinical Nurse immediately\nresponded to the call and upon arrival, saw Epstein on the floor within his cell unresponsive with CPR in\nprogress by COs. The Clinical Nurse’s memorandum reads that Epstein was cold, with circumferential\nbruising around his neck and posterior motling, pupils fixes and dilatated, and no palpable pulses were felt.\nAccording to the memorandum, at 6:35 a.m., a call was placed for EMS, CPR continued, and an AED was\nutilized and indicated “No Shock Advised,” so CPR continued. Epstein was then transported to the MCC\nNew York Health Services Unit treatment room with CPR in progress. Upon arrival, Epstein’s pulse was\nchecked, and the AED indicated “No Shock Advised.” EMS and paramedics arrived on the scene, intubated\nEpstein, and gave him medications and fluids.*® Epstein was transported to the local emergency room with\nCPR in progress at approximately 7:lo a.m.\n45 As noted in Chapter 2, BOP policy provides that the need to immediately atend to an apparent suicide victim,\nundertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence over efforts to preserve a\ncrime scene.\n46 The EMS arrival time on the Clinical Nurse’s memorandum is listed as 6:56 a.m. Based on the OIG’s review of other\ndocumentation and interviews, we believe the arrival time reflected on those other documents (6:43 a.m.) is more likely\nthe time of EMS's arrival. We noted that the Clinical Nurse, at the time of EMS’s arrival, was actively engaged in\nadministering CPR to Epstein and responding to the health emergency.\n\n75\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23442", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023516.jpg": "a U.

These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMR)E™ \"Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level | and\nwas not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nFollouing sa archon Suicide Prevention Coordinator on\nJuly 8, use | Chief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein\nshould be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2522o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025223.jpg": "Page 979 |\ndid not return from court. The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch\n(DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the\nEW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer ie, ee\nstaff were informed at approximately l:5o p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmaf would likely not\nreturn from court. Furthermore, Officers\" hoted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon\narrival from his atorney visit.\n\nA review of the 3o-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were completed for the entire MW\nshift on August lo. 2ol9. Houever, a memorandum from Lieutenant\" | ndicates\nOffice tnd Material Handler orn om Leta, Jo after\nMr. Epstein’s death that they did not complete proper 3o-minute rounds at 3:oo a.m. or 5:oo a.m.\nDESCRIPTION OF SCENE\nA detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered\nMr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the a. began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029040.jpg": "Jeffrey Epstein Pedophile . a and His Sex Den ~ The Daily “eo Page 2 of 3\nshape of sex organs, and various sex foys, such as a “twin torpedo” vibrator and creams and lubricants available at\nerotic specialty shops, were stoued near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs.\nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and\nMarcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced fo collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions fo the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local atorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $loo,ooo to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlosida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in\nNew York and South Beach, Florida, and ouns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel\n\no3956-l22l\nhtp:/Awww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billi.... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030397.jpg": "OBTS Number RREST / NOTICE TO APPEAR .. l.

This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with\na swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk\nway leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra\ncoastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any\nsigns of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have\nleft either debris such food containers, cigaretes, cigars etc. None\nwas found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was\n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small\ncabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer\nequipment ae well as exercise equipment. None of this had been\ntouched or tampered with.\nOn the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.\nEpstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the\nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer\nroom and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass\nwindous present. The eastern most and western most are\nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has\n\\ three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of\nl4 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a\nwood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was\nfound ajar, houever the sandy area directly outside of the door did\nnot indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The\ncentral windou was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism\nin the extended outward position. The two windous believed to\nhave been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were\nfound on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the\neastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a\nfingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a\nxubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central\nwindou.\nOnce inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is\na veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The\nblack bag is approximately 2' long by l' high and was placed on\nthe southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The\nindividual knelt doun and pulled the case open and removed cash\nfrom a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar\nbills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen\none hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.\nMelnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned\ndirectly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes.

Epstein, 53, \"did solicit, induce,\n\n| entice or procure\" prostitution with girls, who were between l4 and l6 years old, on at\n\nleast three occasions between Aug. l, 2oo4, and Oct. 3l, 2oo5.\n\n|\n\n| Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,ooo\n\n| bond. His atorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-\n\ndegree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the\n\n| girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date\nwill be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-\ndegree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,ooo fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has ouned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot\nwaterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since l99o.\nThe indictment folloued an ll-lmonth sexual batery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais\nthat began in March 2oo5 alter a Woiun told police tiai der L4-ycui-cis wie podusinci\nmay have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York\nCity, and on Haley Robson, 2o, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by\nEpstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to\nEpstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor\nRobson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and l7 witnesses concerning the\nmassages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone\nnumbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according\nto police. Epstein would then pay the girls $2oo or $3oo, police said.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 66 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32lo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032112.jpg": "* Billionaire In Palm Beach Sex Scandal - July 26, 2oo6 Page 2 of 5\ncalled the moneyman a \"terrific guy\" who \"likes beautiful women as much as\nand many of them are on the younger side.\" Epstein, who reportedly runs a\nmultibillion-dollar investment fund, travels in his oun Boeing 727 (upon w\nhe has transported Bill Clinton to Africa) and ouns a 45,ooo-square-foot m\non Manhatan's Upper East Side.

The District Court declined to\nreconsider its response and denied Maxwell’s motion.\n\nMaxwell appeals the District Court’s denial and\nargues that the alleged constructive amendment is a\nper se violation of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment. Specifically, Maxwell argues that testimony\nabout a witness’s sexual abuse in New Mexico presented\nthe jury with another basis for conviction, which is\ndistinct from the charges in the Indictment.

Instead, Maxwell\ncontends that charged offenses do not qualify as\noffenses involving the sexual abuse of minors because\nsexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each\nstatutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346\nUS. 2o9, 22l (l953). In Maxwell’s view, for example, it\nis possible to <span class=\"highlight\">transport</span> a minor with intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity and not follou through with\nthe planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not\nan essential ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes\nthe same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical\napproach” employed by courts to evaluate prior con-\nvictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o).\nGenerally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires\nthat courts “look only to the statutory definitions—i.e.,\nthe elements” of the relevant offense to determine if\nthe provision applies “and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.” Descamps v. United\nStates, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) Gnternal quotation\nmarks omited). Whether a statute requires a categori-\ncal or case-specific approach is a question of statutory\ninterpretation. To determine whether Congress used\nthe word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in\nthe abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the\nCourt must examine the statute’s “text, context, and\nhistory.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 238l9, 2327\n(2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the ques-\ntion, the Second Circuit has strongly suggested that\nMaxwell’s approach is the wrong one.

The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.!? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\nl Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU\nthat evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said\nSHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate.

According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, everyone who regularly\nworked in the SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate. The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou Inmate 3 had left MCC New York earlier that day\nand was unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate. He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to\nReceiving and Discharge as “WAB\" and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have\nbeen notified. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his\nshift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed. The OIG’s\ninvestigation revealed, houever, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of\nthe USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC\nNew York on August 9. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have\nknoun that Epstein was without a cellmate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the\nSHU tiers during the round.

Noel recalled\nhearing Thomas say, “Breathe, Epstein, breathe,” and “We're going to be in so much trouble.” Noel said she\nstood at the door about a foot away from Epstein’s cell and never went in. Noel said Thomas only\nperformed chest compressions and said she did not see Thomas checking for breath or pulse. Noel said\nthat when she saw Epstein, he looked blue and did not have a shirt on or anything around his neck. Noel\nsaid she did not get the cuter because Thomas did not need it based upon the ripping sound she heard.\nNoel said an MCC New York Lieutenant who responded to the alarm asked her what happened, and before\nshe got the chance to answer, Thomas stated, “Oh, it's not her fault, we fucked up.” Noel did not recall\nmaking any comments or statements to the Lieutenant. Other than the Lieutenant, Noel did not recall\nwhich COs responded to the alarm and she did not knou what happened in the cell after MCC New York\nstaff arrived because she was waiting at the botom of the steps outside the L Tier.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood\nthe inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not\nconducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his oun\nlife and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff\nmembers were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with\ntransporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then folloued the\nambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.\nThe OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs\natempting to resuscitate Epstein.

The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recrulis.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\nSince his l3-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has setled more than a dozen Jawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $7 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\nThe victims fold police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Redriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\n@ devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntouels and puting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2oo4 and 2oo5, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police atention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 9ll. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriquez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his oun prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation.\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\n\n| nugget\"—his term—for $5o,ooo, fo be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\n\n: undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been setled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to l8 months in federal prison (Epstein was alloued to serve l3 months in the Palm Beach\n\n| county jai), and nou awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,o6o in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nfo the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD basebkail hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his oun deposition, acknouledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $loo,ooo for same sophisticated equipment. The police were stil researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local atorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $loo,ooo to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\niraining.}\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, ouner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npatern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of l7, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.}\nBrunel is a 5o-plus French playboy who was formerly part ouner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in\nNew York and South Beach, Florida, and ouns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel\n\no3956-l22l\nhtp:/Awww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billi.... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o4o"};
