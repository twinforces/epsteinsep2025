These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this\ncircuit, United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). After careful\nconsideration of the Defense’s arguments and the thorough reasoning in Raymond, the Court\nconcludes that Dr. Rocchio’s anticipated testimony is admissible with one exception. The Court\nwill address first why Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is admissible and then address the one opinion\nthat it will exclude.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rocchio’s method is reliable and well-accepted in her <span class=\"highlight\">profession</span>. It is for this\nreason that several courts in this circuit have admited the testimony of similar experts, such as\ntestimony on so-called trauma bonding to explain why prostitutes may not flee from their pimps\neven when not physically restrained. In United States v. Kidd, the court admited the testimony,\nfinding it to be “quite common| ]” and accepted in the academic literature. 385 F. Supp. 3d at\n263. Identical testimony was admited by Judge Furman in United States v. Dupigny, No. l8-\nCr.-528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), Dkt. No. l98 at 27, by Judge Engelmayer in United States v.\nRandall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335 at 24-3o, and by Judge Cote in United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l).\n\nTheir decisions are consistent with the vast majority of courts to consider the admission\nof such experts. A number of courts have admited experts on the particular topic of grooming at\nissue here, a sample of which include the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Romero, l89 F.3d\n576, 585 (7th Cir. l999), the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir.\n2oo6), the Ninth Circuit in United States v.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">profession</span> is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 45\nl66 McElvaney\ndelay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused’s right\nto a speedy trial.

(/n Re Jordan (l974) l2\n\nCal.3d 575, 58o [ll6 Cal.Rptr. 37l].) Preserving the confidentiality of client information\n\ncontributes to the trust that is the hallmark of the lawyer-client relationship.

Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in\norder to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations,\ndeemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l). (See, e.g., Commercial Standard\nTitle Co. v. Superior Court (l979) 92 Cal.App.3d 934, 945 [l55 Cal.Rptr.393].)\nLawyer-client confidentiality encompasses the lawyer-client privilege, the work-product\ndoctrine and ethical standards of confidentiality\n[2] The principle of lawyer-client confidentiality applies to information a lawyer\nacquires by virtue of the representation, whatever its source, and encompasses maters\ncommunicated in confidence by the client, and therefore protected by the lawyer-client\nprivilege, maters protected by the work product doctrine, and maters protected under\nethical standards of confidentiality, all as established in law, rule and policy. (See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express exception. Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Pagellof l4\nlikely to result in death or substantial* bodily harm to an individual.

A lawyer may decide not to reveal such information. Whether a lawyer\nchooses to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited\nunder this rule is a mater for the individual lawyer to decide, based on all the facts and\ncircumstances, such as those discussed in Comment [6] of this rule.\n\nWhether to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code section\n6o68, subdivision (e) as permited under paragraph (b)\n\n[6] Disclosure permited under paragraph (b) is ordinarily a last resort, when no\nother available action is reasonably” likely to prevent the criminal act.

Among the factors to be considered in determining\nwhether to disclose information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) are the\nfollouing:\n\n(l) the amount of time that the lawyer has to make a decision about\ndisclosure;\n\n(2) whether the client or a third-party has made similar threats before and\nwhether they have ever acted or atempted to act upon them;\n\n(3) whether the lawyer believes* the lawyer's efforts to persuade the client or\na third person* not to engage in the criminal conduct have or have not\nbeen successful;\n\n(4) the extent of adverse effect to the client’s rights under the Fifth, Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and analogous\nrights and privacy rights under Article | of the Constitution of the State of\nCalifornia that may result from disclosure contemplated by the lawyer;\n\n(5) the extent of other adverse effects to the client that may result from\ndisclosure contemplated by the lawyer; and\n\n(6) the nature and extent of information that must be disclosed to prevent the\ncriminal act or threatened harm.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l2 of l4\nA lawyer may also consider whether the prospective harm to the victim or victims is\nimminent in deciding whether to disclose the information protected by section 6o68,\nsubdivision (e)(l). Houever, the imminence of the harm is not a prerequisite to\ndisclosure and a lawyer may disclose the information protected by section 6o68,\nsubdivision (e)(l) without waiting until immediately before the harm is likely to occur.\nWhether to counsel client or third person* not to commit a criminal act reasonably* likely\nto result in death or substantial* bodily harm\n[7] Paragraph (c)(l) provides that before a lawyer may reveal information protected\nby Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l), the lawyer must, if\nreasonable* under the circumstances, make a good faith effort to persuade the client\nnot to commit or to continue the criminal act, or to persuade the client to otherwise\npursue a course of conduct that will prevent the threatened death or substantial* bodily\nharm, including persuading the client to take action to prevent a third person* from\ncommiting or continuing a criminal act. If necessary, the client may be persuaded to do\nboth. The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\ndisclosure of information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present. When the actor is a nonclient or when the act is deliberate or malicious, the\nlawyer who contemplates making adverse disclosure of protected information may\nreasonably* conclude that the compelling interests of the lawyer or others in their oun\npersonal safety preclude personal contact with the actor. Before counseling an actor\nwho is a nonclient, the lawyer should, if reasonable* under the circumstances, first\nadvise the client of the lawyer’s intended course of action. If a client or another person*\nhas already acted but the intended harm has not yet occurred, the lawyer should\nconsider, if reasonable* under the circumstances, efforts to persuade the client or third\nperson* to warn the victim or consider other appropriate action to prevent the harm.\nEven when the lawyer has concluded that paragraph (b) does not permit the lawyer to\nreveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l), the lawyer nevertheless\nis permited to counsel the client as to why it may be in the client’s best interest to\nconsent to the atorney’s disclosure of that information.\nDisclosure of information protected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68,\nSubdivision (e)(l) must be no more than is reasonably* necessary to prevent the\ncriminal act\n[8] Paragraph (d) requires that disclosure of information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited by paragraph (b), when\nmade, must be no more extensive than is necessary to prevent the criminal act.\nDisclosure should allou access to the information to only those persons* who the lawyer\nreasonably believes* can act to prevent the harm.

What particular measures\nare reasonable* depends on the circumstances knoun* to the lawyer. Relevant\ncircumstances include the time available, whether the victim might be unaware of the\nthreat, the lawyer’s prior course of dealings with the client, and the extent of the adverse\neffect on the client that may result from the disclosure contemplated by the lawyer.\nInforming client pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal\ninformation protected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(l)\n[9] A lawyer is required to keep a client reasonably” informed about significant\ndevelopments regarding the representation. (See rule l.4; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6o68,\nsubd. (m).) Paragraph (c)(2), houever, recognizes that under certain circumstances,\ninforming a client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) would likely increase the\nrisk of death or substantial* bodily harm, not only to the originally-intended victims of the\ncriminal act, but also to the client or members of the client’s family, or to the lawyer or\nthe lawyer's family or associates. Therefore, paragraph (c)(2) requires a lawyer to\ninform the client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) only if it is reasonable™* to\ndo so under the circumstances. Paragraph (c)(2) further recognizes that the\nappropriate time for the lawyer to inform the client may vary depending upon the\ncircumstances. (See Comment [lo] of this rule.) Among the factors to be considered in\ndetermining an appropriate time, if any, to inform a client are:\n\n(l) whether the client is an experienced user of legal services;\n\n(2) the frequency of the lawyer's contact with the client;\n\n(3) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(4) whether the lawyer and client have discussed the lawyer’s duty of\nconfidentiality or any exceptions to that duty;\n\n(5) the likelihood that the client's mater will involve information within\nparagraph (b);\n\n(6) — the lawyer’s belief,* if applicable, that so informing the client is likely to\nincrease the likelihood that a criminal act likely to result in the death of, or\nsubstantial* bodily harm to, an individual; and\n\n(7) — the lawyer’s belief,“ if applicable, that good faith efforts to persuade a\nclient not to act on a threat have failed.\n\nAvoiding a chilling effect on the lawyer-client relationship\n[lo] The foregoing flexible approach to the lawyer’s informing a client of his or her\nability or decision to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l4 of l4\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognizes the concern that informing a client about\nlimits on confidentiality may have a chilling effect on client communication. (See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the\nlawyer will have satisfied the lawyer’s obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be\nsubject to discipline.\n\nInforming client that disclosure has been made; termination of the lawyer-client\nrelationship\n[ll] When a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions\nCode section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary\ncases the relationship between lawyer and client that is based on trust and confidence\nwill have deteriorated so as to make the lawyer’s representation of the client impossible.\nTherefore, when the relationship has deteriorated because of the lawyer’s disclosure,\nthe lawyer is required to seek to withdraw from the representation, unless the client has\ngiven informed consent* to the lawyer’s continued representation. The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyer’s disclosure. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation. (See rule l.l6.)\nOther consequences of the lawyer's disclosure\n[l2] Depending upon the circumstances of a lawyer’s disclosure of information\nprotected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as\npermited by this rule, there may be other important issues that a lawyer must address.\nFor example, a lawyer who is likely to testify as a witness in a mater involving a client\nmust comply with rule 3.7. Similarly, the lawyer must also consider his or her duties of\nloyalty and competence. (See rules l.7 and l.l.)\nOther exceptions to confidentiality under California law\n[l3] This rule is not intended to augment, diminish, or preclude any other exceptions\nto the duty to preserve information protected by Business and Professions Code section\n6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognized under California law.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll42o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 63 of lol 63\nM6SQmaxSl\n\nl behavior so they could together continue to harm children and\n\n2 young women.
