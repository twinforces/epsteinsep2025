Offering this opinion in this form can\nonly serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category,\nare more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz\nacknouledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a “‘case-by-case basis” (Ex. A at ll),\nthat case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and\nstereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that “significant proportions” of victims exhibit post-traumatic\nstress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are\n“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a\nsexual assault event.” (Ex. A at ll).\n\nThis opinion is confusing and appears not to be relevant to the facts of the case. First, Dr.\nDietz’s conclusion that victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms are unlikely to\n“unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event” is illogical given that it appears to place the\nresponsibility on the victim for experiencing repeated assaults, and at a minimum he should be\nrequired to disclose comprehensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as unlikely.\n\nSecond, a critical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers—\nincluding the pouer imbalance arising from the age <span class=\"highlight\">differential</span> between them and the abusers—\nand those who are not.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age <span class=\"highlight\">differential</span>\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not.

This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007678.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l85 of 375\n\n2o.
