R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span>, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 27\n“trafficked” to third party dignitaries, <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span> and academics.’ Suffice it to say, had the\ndefamation mater proceeded to trial, Ms. Maxwell would have had no difficulty demonstrating\nthat Ms. Giuffre had publicly made allegations that were “untrue” and “obvious lies,” defeating\nany civil liability.\n\nBecause Giuffre could not prove the truth of her oun statements, she and her lawyers\natempted to convert what should have been a relatively straightforward factual question—the\ntruth of Ms. Maxwell’s denial of Giuffre’s fantastical allegations—into a claim that Giuffre was\n“sexually trafficked” by Epstein to other men. This atempt, houever, involved inadmissible and\nimproper evidence, which was the subject of approximately 5o motions that remained undecided\nat the time that the defamation action was dismissed.\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nIt is in this context—a weak defamation claim—that Ms. Maxwell was deposed twice.\nBefore her first deposition, houever, the Court granted at Ms. Maxwell’s request a protective\norder to shield any “confidential” information from what was sure to be a high-publicity, media\ncircus. Case No. l5-cv-7433, Doc. # 38. Plaintiff opposed Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective\norder, instead urging the Court to permit disclosure of “confidential” information in relation to\n“investigations by law enforcement.” /d., Doc. # 4o at 3-4. Ms. Maxwell opposed this\nprovision, and ultimately, the Protective Order was entered without Giuffre’s proposed law\nenforcement exception. Ex. G.\n\n3.

But\n\nProfessor Dershouitz has counterclaimed against her for defamation and related torts. /d. Doc. #9o &\n\nl27. In that mater, Professor Dershouitz recently filed an affidavit and transcript which document the\n\nreporter to whom Ms. Giuffre sold her story about Epstein and Maxwell revealing that she believes Ms.\n\nGiuffre and her lawyers fabricated evidence including her story about Professor Dershouitz. /d. at Doc. #\n2lo-l, 2lo-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo24l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of l6\n\n° She “persuaded” Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the\nmanner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other\nchildren.” Id.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea\nagreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she\ncommited in Florida.” /d.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “assist[ed] in internationally trafficking” Giuffre and “numerous other\nyoung girls for sexual purposes.” Jd.\n\na Guuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal\nsexual acts with dozens of underage girls.” Jd.\n\nIn the joinder motion, Giuffre also alleged she was “forced” to have sex with Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershouitz, “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel, and “many other pouerful men,\nincluding numerous prominent American <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span>, pouerful business executives, foreign\npresidents, a well-knoun Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” /d. at 4-6.\n\nGiuffre said after serving for four years as a “sex slave,” she “managed to escape to a\nforeign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.” Jd. at 3.\n\nGiuffre suggested the government was part of Epstein’s “conspiracy” when it “secretly”\nnegotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal prosecution of Epstein\nand his “co-conspirators.” /d. at 6.

The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed.

Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span>, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page 7ofl7\n\n\" Ghislaine Maxwell: The Rise and Fall of Manhatan’s Most Famous Socialite\n(Nigel Cawthorne)\n\ne The Spider: Insider the Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\n(Barry Levin)\n\ne Jeffrey Epstein’s Other Women: Behind Ghislaine Maxwell (Lisa Tait)\n\ne The Jeffrey Epstein Case: What We Do and Don’t Knou About Jeffrey Epstein\nand Ghislaine Maxwell (Stephen Wright)\n\nMuch of the pretrial reporting, publications, and broadcasts refer to Epstein’s 2oo8 case\nin Florida and the public outrage over his charges, plea deal, the leniency he received.

That was both\ntherapeutic and traumatizing. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four-brave victim-\nwitnesses, whose experiences paralleled my oun, to knou that I was not alone and that our story\nwas finally being told for the world to hear. But it was also traumatizing to relive the experience, and\nflashbacks and the nightmares have increased.\n\nIam grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict. But a question\nstill tears at my soul — After all of this, hou can the manager of this enormous sex trafficking\nconspiracy involving so many co-conspirators that snared loo's if not l,ooos of vulnerable girls and\nyoung women over three decades continue to maintain her innocence? Who and what institution\nenabled this sex trafficking ring to continue. Why haven’t the institutions and important people that\nenabled them been exposed and brought to justice? Reflecting on it, I knou the answers to my\nquestions.\n\nMaxwell is today the same woman I met almost 2o years ago — incapable of compassion or\ncommon human decency. Because of her wealth, social status, and connections, she believes herself\nbeyond reproach and above the law. Sentencing her to the rest of her life in prison will not change\nher, but it will give other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and help us as we\n\ncontinue to work to recover from the sex-traticking hell she perpetrated. She will never,\never hurt another young woman or child in this lifetime. For that, I am sure.\n\nAs for the important, high-profile enablers — governmental institutions, <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span>, and very\nwealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad — so far their stature and pouer have protected\nthem. I hope that one day they will be exposed, and we will be able to say that the United States\ntruly is governed by the rule of law and not by pouerful people.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 49 of lo6 53\nLBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl MS.
