R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span>, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 27\n“trafficked” to third party dignitaries, <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span> and academics.’ Suffice it to say, had the\ndefamation mater proceeded to trial, Ms. Maxwell would have had no difficulty demonstrating\nthat Ms. Giuffre had publicly made allegations that were “untrue” and “obvious lies,” defeating\nany civil liability.\n\nBecause Giuffre could not prove the truth of her oun statements, she and her lawyers\natempted to convert what should have been a relatively straightforward factual question—the\ntruth of Ms. Maxwell’s denial of Giuffre’s fantastical allegations—into a claim that Giuffre was\n“sexually trafficked” by Epstein to other men. This atempt, houever, involved inadmissible and\nimproper evidence, which was the subject of approximately 5o motions that remained undecided\nat the time that the defamation action was dismissed.\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nIt is in this context—a weak defamation claim—that Ms. Maxwell was deposed twice.\nBefore her first deposition, houever, the Court granted at Ms. Maxwell’s request a protective\norder to shield any “confidential” information from what was sure to be a high-publicity, media\ncircus.

Plaintiff opposed Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective\norder, instead urging the Court to permit disclosure of “confidential” information in relation to\n“investigations by law enforcement.” /d., Doc. # 4o at 3-4. Ms. Maxwell opposed this\nprovision, and ultimately, the Protective Order was entered without Giuffre’s proposed law\nenforcement exception. Ex. G.\n\n3.

Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and <span class=\"highlight\">politicians</span>, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005212.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page 7ofl7\n\n\" Ghislaine Maxwell: The Rise and Fall of Manhatan’s Most Famous Socialite\n(Nigel Cawthorne)\n\ne The Spider: Insider the Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\n(Barry Levin)\n\ne Jeffrey Epstein’s Other Women: Behind Ghislaine Maxwell (Lisa Tait)\n\ne The Jeffrey Epstein Case: What We Do and Don’t Knou About Jeffrey Epstein\nand Ghislaine Maxwell (Stephen Wright)\n\nMuch of the pretrial reporting, publications, and broadcasts refer to Epstein’s 2oo8 case\nin Florida and the public outrage over his charges, plea deal, the leniency he received.
