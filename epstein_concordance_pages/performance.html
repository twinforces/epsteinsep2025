(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case.

This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

By May,\n2ol7, shortly before the civil defamation case was dismissed, the mater had generated over 9oo\ndocket entries.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies.

ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 38\nagreement is not simply a party to a contract. The Government is required to observe high\nstandards of integrity and honorable conduct, and the supervisory pouer of the court is designed\nto insure that such standards are observed.”). Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental constitutional rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n<span class=\"highlight\">performance</span>.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53). Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise\nmade by one atorney must be atributed . . . to the Government.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l9o\n(quoting Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54 (l972)).\n\nThe government’s atempt to evade the NPA flies in the face of these time-honored, and\nhonorable, principles. Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution. Houever, the Court can be comfortable\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo259o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 28 of 38\ndefendant’s plea agreement explicitly stated that it “is binding on the United States only in [the\nEastern] district”), aff'd, 774 F.2d 3o (2d Cir. l985). Because there is no such language in the\nNPA here, Ms. Maxwell’s position is entirely consistent with these cases, and they counsel in\nfavor of enforcement of the NPA in this case.\n\nOther Second Circuit cases citing Annabi also support Ms. Maxwell’s position. In United\nStates v. Broun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2), the defendants\nrelied solely on their “subjective beliefs” and “implicit understanding” that they would not be\nprosecuted further in another district, which the court held irrelevant; they cited no “affirmative\nappearance” in support of their position, as Ms. Maxwell has. And in Russo, the court found it\nunnecessary to reach Annabi, but acknouledged that an “affirmative appearance” of an intent to\nbind other USAOs can be found even where a plea agreement does not contain an express\nstatement to that effect—an interpretation that supports Ms. Maxwell’s position that the NPA\nbinds the government here. Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626.\n\nc. To the extent that Annabi conflicts with Eleventh Circuit law,\nEleventh Circuit law applies and would require enforcement of the\nNPA here.\n\nUnder federal choice-of-law rules, which apply in non-diversity cases, factors in\ndetermining which jurisdiction’s contract law applies include (i) any choice-of-law provision in\nthe contract; (ll) the place where the contract was negotiated, issued, and signed; (ili) the place of\n<span class=\"highlight\">performance</span>; (iv) the location of the subject mater of the contract; and (v) the domicile,\nresidence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. Advani\nEnters., Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyds, l4o F.3d l57, l62 (2d Cir. l998). New York conflict-of-\nlaw rules similarly require that the law of the jurisdiction with the most significant contacts and\ngreatest interest governs the construction of a contract. See Index Fund, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N.\nAm., 58o F.2d ll58, ll6l-62 (2d Cir. l978).

We have long recognized that plea agreements are significantly different from\ncommercial contracts.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (emphasis added). The court explained:\n\nGovernment conduct in negotiating plea agreements must comport with the\n\nhighest standard of fairness. Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental constitutional rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">performance</span>.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “sufficient in these circumstances” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\nprotection from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. This\ninformation could be confirmed through discovery.\n\nMedia reports regarding the November 2o2o OPR report further support Ms. Maxwell’s\nposition.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case.

The Government has raised various relevancy objections\nto the documents that Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 are atempting to obtain. The current\nvictims have responded by explaining hou these documents are relevant, including explaining\nhou these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his pouerful political and\nsocial connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s\nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to\nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knouledge. See, e.g.,\n\nDE 266 at 6-lo. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of\nthese requests, as well as the need for those requests.\n\nOne clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding\nEpstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea\narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince\nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz. Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2\nhave alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the\nnon-prosecution agreement, his <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> was delayed while he used his significant social and\npolitical connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal.

Jane Doe #3 has directly person knouledge of\nEpstein’s connection with some of these pouerful! people and thus hou Epstein might have used\nthem to secure favorable treatment.\n\nAdding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings.

As the government acknouledges, at least\nthree courts have applied the third-party beneficiary doctrine to confer standing on third parties\nto enforce immunity provisions in plea agreements. Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228; E/-\nSadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d at 6o8-o9; United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3\n(D.S.C. l984), aff'd, 749 F.2d 33 (4 Cir. l984). The government’s atempt to distinguish these\ncases on the ground that they did not “analyze” the applicability of the third-party beneficiary\ndoctrine to plea agreements (Opp. l9) is uterly nonsensical. As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s\nopening memorandum (“Mem.”), all three courts expressly held that the doctrine applies. Mem.\nl6-l7.\n\nThe lone case cited by the government to the contrary does not suggest a different result\nhere. In United States v. Mariamma Viju (ol), the court held that a third party may not enforce\nrights under a plea agreement “[w]here the defendant himself can obtain relief” from a broken\nplea deal.” No. 3:l5-CR-o24o-B, 2ol6 WL lo784l, *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll, 2ol6). Here,\nEpstein cannot obtain relief for the government’s breach of the NPA; not only is he deceased, but\nhe served the sentence stemming from his guilty plea long before his death, paid millions of\ndollars to accusers under the NPA’s claims provision, and thus would have had no occasion to\nenforce the NPA by withdrawing his guilty plea. Nor is it clear that Epstein could have\nwithdrawn his plea had the NPA been breached while he was serving his sentence, given that the\nNPA—unlike a plea agreement—was not submited to the state court in which Epstein entered\nhis plea.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3883\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page3ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 263 of 349\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB.

She expected that no further incidents like this one would occur.\n\nTouard the end of 2oo3, Cosby invited Constand to meet at the Foxwoods Casino\nin Connecticut.

Constand called the representative back and\nrecorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her\nmother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them. Constand declined the\noffer and did not provide the requested information. Constand then received a message\nfrom one of Cosby’s atorneys, who stated that he was calling to discuss the creation of\na trust that Cosby wanted to set up in order to provide financial assistance for Constand’s\neducation. Constand never returned the atorney’s call.\n\nIn the meantime, the Durham Regional Police Department referred Constand’s\npolice report to the Philadelphia Police Department, which, in turn, referred it to the\nCheltenham Police Department in Montgomery County, where Cosby’s residence was\nlocated. The case was assigned to Sergeant Richard Schaeffer, who worked in tandem\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo482o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5/7 of 8o\nPennsylvania State Police that he or she was subject to the intervening statute and thus\nhad to comply with the new obligations under SORNA, even though those obligations\ncontradicted the terms of each of their plea deals. /d. at 522-523.\n\nEach of the three offenders filed an action seeking the enforcement of the terms\nof his guilty plea, notwithstanding the fact that those terms conflicted with the newly-\nenacted statute. /d. at 523-24.

Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request.

The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the\nprosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his\nright to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, houever, that, by contrast, when a\n“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this\ninduced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24\n\nConsidered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their\nword, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full\nunderstanding of the circumstances, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of\none or more constitutional rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or\ndecisions under principles of contract law or by application of the fundamental fairness\nconsiderations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 73 of 8o\ndo just that, D.A. Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span>’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span>” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv.

McSorley,\n485 A.2d l5, 2o (Pa. Super. l984), aff'd, 5o6 A.2d 895 (Pa. l986) (per curiam) (enforcing\nan incomplete agreement based upon detrimental reliance). As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement. In that case, Stipetich agreed with the police that, if he revealed\nhis source for obtaining drugs, no charges would be filed against him or his wife.\nStipetich, 652 A.2d at l294-95. Even though Stipetich fulfilled his end of the bargain,\ncharges still were filed against him and his wife. /d. at l295.

In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 2\n7/94 - 7/95 Pre-Doctoral Intern in Psychology\nYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT\nNew Haven Hospital and Yale Psychiatric Institute\n9/93 - 5/94 Clinical Psychology Extern\nCounseling Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\n5/9l - 5/94 Clinical Psychology Trainee\nPsychological Consultation Center, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI\n9/92 - 5/93 Clinical Psychology Extern\nPsychological Services, Broun University, Providence, RI\n6/9o - 8/9o Family Service Student Counselor\n7/9l - 8/9l Pre-Natal Clinic, St. Joseph's Hospital\nDepartment of Family Service, Providence, RI\nTRAINING AND CONSULTATION EXPERIENCE\n2ooo - 2oo2 Psychological Consultant\nNorth Providence School Department\nPerformed comprehensive psychological evaluations of elementary school students\nto determine the impact of psychological difficulties on school <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> and\nfunctioning.

The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations l23\n\nSetrakian, L.

The government suggested to us that we must avoid any\npublic mention of: (l) names of people, places, or specific addresses or locations; (2) particular\ndates of career events or life events; (3) names of any employers, particular performances, or\ncharacters played; (4) specific details of story arcs in any performances played; (5) references to\npublicly available information or publicly available records that contain a pseudonymous\nwitness’s real name; and (6) court filings or other court documents.\n\nRespectfully, the government’s proposal is overly broad and unworkable.\n\nWe are mindful of the Court’s orders on this topic, and we have no objection to many of\nthe government’s suggestions—e.g., the names of people or specific addresses or particular\nemployers.

Nos. 575 & 576) was e-mailed to\nthe Court and placed under temporary seal, nou be unsealed. Like the Defendant’s Motion for a\nNew Trial, Juror 5o’s motion is a “judicial document” to which the presumption of access under\nboth the common law and the First Amendment applies because Juror 5o’s motion has been, and\ncontinues to be, highly “relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and useful in the\nJudicial process.” U.S. v.

Dkt. Nos. 57l, 573. The\njuror’s submission prompted two Orders by the Court in which it reached conclusions about\nwhether it should consider Juror 5o’s motion before or after it addresses the question of whether\nan inquiry should be permited, which may also affect whether Juror 5o has standing to be heard\non that question. Dkt. Nos. 575, 576. At the Court’s direction it would also appear that the\njuror’s motion is the subject of multiple rounds of briefing by the parties: First, on the question\nof whether the juror’s motion should be redacted and/or docketed, and nou on its procedural and\nsubstantive merits in the context of briefing the Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial. /d. All of\nthose actions involve <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and the judicial process. Nor does the\nfact that the Court has deferred considering and/or ruling on Juror No. 5o’s motion affect its\nstatus as a “Judicial document”. Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d.\nCir. 2oo6) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the\nunderlying motion, any atempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).\n\nMoreover, because the proceedings noted above reflect that Juror 5o’s motion is “directly\naffect[ing] the adjudication” of this case, the public’s presumption of access to it is especially\nhigh. United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“Amodeo IT’). The\npresumption is likewise strong because the juror’s motion affects both the juror’s and the parties’\nlegal rights. /d. Those include whether Juror 5o is afforded standing to be heard and, more\nbroadly, the issues being briefed related to the Defendant’s request for a new trial. And while\nJuror 5o’s motion is under temporary seal, the posture of this case illustrates why there is a\n4863-79l l-5787v.l ool99l8-oooo33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo883o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document582 Filed ol/25/22 Page3of4\nJanuary 24, 2o22\nPage 3\nstrong presumption of “contemporaneous access” to it. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The right of\naccess exists primarily because “public monitoring [of courts] is an essential feature of\ndemocratic control”. Amodeo IT, 7l F.3d at lo48. “[W]ithout access to testimony and\ndocuments that are used in the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of Article III functions”, it is not possible to\neffectively understand and monitor the proceedings in this case that relate to Juror 5o’s motion as\nthey take place. Id.\n\nFinally, for many of the same reasons supporting access to Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial, it appears unlikely there is “a substantial probability of harm to a compelling interest” that\nwould result from placing Juror 5o’s motion on the public docket. See Under Seal v. Under Seal,\n273 F. Supp. 3d 46o, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“A proponent of sealing may overcome the\npresumption of access by demonstrating a substantial probability of harm to a compelling\ninterest.”). Juror No. 5o’s privacy interest is particularly lou here, given that he has voluntarily\ndisclosed his identity and history in various interviews. See In re Application to Unseal 98 Cr.\nLIOlI(ILG), 89l F. Supp. 2d 296, 3oo (E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). And the Court has already solicited\nsubmissions from the parties regarding any proposed redactions, so the Court can assess whether\nthey may be discrete redactions, if any, that need be made to protect any other compelling\ninterest.\n\nFor all these reasons, ABC News and NBC News respectfully request that the Court\nunseal Defendant’s motion for a new trial and Juror No. 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\n4863-79l l-5787v.l ool99l8-oooo33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo883l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page2of5\ninfluenced deliberations. See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\nquestionnaire, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\nquestionnaire and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page3of5\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First Amendment Right of Access\nAn independent First Amendment right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong). See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal. (“Press-Enterprise\nIT’), 478 U.S. l, 8-9 (l986); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. Once the right\nataches, it is overcome only by specific, on-the-record findings that\nsealing “is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document587 Filed ol/27/22 Pagelof4\nj j Suite 5oo East\nLi Davis Wright l3ol K Street NW\nJ Tremaine LLP Washington, D.C. 2ooo5-33l7\n\nNathan Siegel\n2o2.973.4237 tel\nNathanSiegel@dwt.com\n\nJanuary 26, 2o22\n\nVIA EMAIL AND FED EX\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s Order dated\nJanuary 26, 2o22, which provided that the Government “may file on ECF” a response to the\ndefendant’s leter filed on February l, 2o22 in which the defendant argued that her motion for a\nnew trial (the “Defense Motion”) and its exhibits should be sealed. (Dkt. No. 585). For the reasons\ndiscussed herein, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant has not justified her\nsealing request and, accordingly, the Defense Motion and its exhibits should be publicly docketed.\n\nIn examining whether there is a common law right of access to documents submited to a\ncourt—and thus whether sealing is permissible—courts undertake a three-part inquiry. Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, a court must determine whether\nthe record or document in question is a “judicial document,” that is, whether the document is\n‘relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,’” such that\na presumption of access ataches. /d. at ll9 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45\n(2d Cir. l995)). Second, if a document is indeed a “judicial document,” the court must determine\nthe weight to be accorded the presumption of access. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9.

Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. Temporary sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nBoth parties agree that the motion papers are “judicial document[s] that [are] subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and common law.” Dkt. No. 594\nat 2 (quoting Dkt. No. 59o at 4). Houever, the Defendant argues that sealing pending a hearing\nor resolution is necessary “to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process that may take\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page6eof7\nto have falsely represented information on pre-selection questionnaire and during oral voir dire).\nJuror 5o is the potential subject of a post-verdict inquiry, not a party with an interest in the\ncriminal case. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”). The Defendant’s effort to liken the motion to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l2 Filed o2/24/22 Page3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJanuary l3, 2o22\nPage 3\n\nThe fact that Juror 5o filed these pleadings does not make them “judicial documents.”\nUnited States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995) (“We think that the\nmere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial\ndocument subject to the right of public access. We think that the item filed must be relevant to\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be\ndesignated a judicial document.”). Moreover, Ms. Maxwell anticipates moving to strike the\npleadings and, if stricken, the documents enjoy no presumption of public access. Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike\nsuch material from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the\njudicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document” and would enjoy no\npresumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the public has a\nright of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that “[b]efore any such\ncommon law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude that the documents at issue\nare indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9. “Once the court has determined that\nthe documents are judicial documents and that therefore a common law presumption of access\nataches, it must determine the weight of that presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the\nweight of the presumption of access, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against\nit.” Jd. at l2o.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 36 of 66\nmaterial if it has a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the judge\nwho must decide whether to excuse a juror for cause.” (citing Neder v.

Had Juror No. 5o answered Questions 25 and 48 truthfully, his answers\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\n\nThe second question is whether truthful responses from Juror No. 5o would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. “[T]he test\nis not whether the true facts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but\nrather whether a truthful response ‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Daugerdas, 867 F.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424.

Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard.

Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First Amendment Right of Access\nAn independent First Amendment right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong).

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020402.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel6 of 9l\n\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

In accordance with\nthis Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89, she filed these materials under seal\nand proposed narrouly tailored redactions on those materials. The Government did not\nfile any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The Court will adopt the\nDefendant's proposed redactions after applying the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\nUnder this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are\n\"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (ll) balance competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the\ndanger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of\nthose resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"),\n7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court\nfinds that the Defendant's submissions are \"relevant to the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of the judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process,” thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\"\nfor purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo\nI\"), 44 F3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And the Court also finds that the common law\npresumption of access ataches. Id. at l46; see also Nixon v.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a\nlawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a\nwitness. N.Y. R. Prof] Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the\ndeposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not\nrequired to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021438.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 962 3536o39, Page8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*®° Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health.

The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required\nnotifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further belou—\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023474.jpg": "is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which\nemphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk doun all of the SHU tiers during a round. During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.

The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence.

This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\n<span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her <span class=\"highlight\">performance</span> in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the\nhtn://www.printhis.clickabilitv.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 26 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032077.jpg": "eee een ee\nZ\nEX: whose identity they could not be alloued to ust as Nederlander and Toboroff were Ms: of Epstein’s work is related to clean-\nea knou.
