Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.o5.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo275", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000276.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page 3 of l6\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global setlement for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l. Any perception that Mr. Epstein poses any conceivable danger or flight\nrisk may be readily dispelled by a slate of highly restrictive conditions, which amply suffice to\nsecure his release:\n\nl.

Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F.

Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F.

It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000372.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl4_ Filed o7/l5/l9 Page 7 of l8 |\n| | -- SORAHEARING page 6 |\n| | U l Even though the first prosecutor left, presumably the\n| | 2 prosecutor's office has the file. :\n3 THE COURT: I would still call the prosecutor. |\n| 4 MS.

So one question I have for each side is what about\n\n7 New Mexico. That's half of the question.\n\n8 The rest of the question is as follous: Mr. Epstein\n\n9 has applied in New York state to louer his sex offender status\nlo from what's called a level 3, which is the highest level which\nll I think carries with it a high risk of recidivism, according to\nl2 these levels and to sex offender regulation.\n\nl3 And he sought to have that louered to level l. His\n\nl4 application was denied, as I understand the proceedings, by the\nl5 Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders New York state and then in\nl6 state court by the courts and, particularly, a decision of the\nl7 Honorable Justice Ruth Pickholz on our about January l8, 2oll.\nl8 I believe that decision was appealed to the New York State\n\nl9 Appellate Division and was unanimously upheld.\n2o I read this morning a copy of the transcript of the\nal proceedings before Judge Pickholz which I'm likely to place on\n22 the docket after today's session. And the question is for each\n23 side. First of all, they're free to comment on my description\n24 of the proceeding before Judge Pickholz.\n25 But the question is whether there were or are other\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo5l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000518.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 36 Filed o7/24/l9 Page 8 of 74 8\n\nl legal or administrative proceedings in Florida, the Virgin\n\n2 Islands, New Mexico, and any other jurisdiction comparable to\n\n3 the one before Judge Pickholz in which she ruled on l-l8-2oll.\n4 So I'm not suggesting that there are, although I think\n5 I did read someplace that there may be some proceeding pending\n6 in New Mexico.

I'm looking for any transcripts in\n\nlo particular and administrative or legal proceedings in other\n\nll states relating in any way to Mr. Epstein's sex offender\n\nl2 status.\n\nl3 The third question on my mind is this: The defense\n\nl4 has submited a brief financial summary to the Court of\n\nl5 Mr. Epstein's assets. And I, as you knou, permited that it be\nl6 submited under seal for, among other reasons that were on my\nl7 mind, not to slou the proceedings doun.\n\nl8 The summary is cursory I would say, short, less than a\nl9 page and does not fully assist me in rendering the bail/remand\n2o decision, that is to say, in its detail or absence of detail.\n2l And moreover, the information provided in that summary seems to\n22 be knoun already to the government in other ways.

If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000797.jpg": "Cas@’4Sol4-4649o-RME DbeuMenPsh l Pilee OV lSu8egedgel 4 oF 33 .\n|\nreasonably assure . . . the safety of the community” if Mr. Epstein is released.

No such |\nmaterials have been received by the Court as of this date.\nThe Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin\nIslands (Level I) and in Florida (Level J). It has received no materials from the Defense\nregarding sex offender applications or proceedings in those two jurisdictions.\nIn sum, based upon all of the proffers and evidence set forth at pp. lo-2l above, the Court\nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein poses a danger to other persons and to\nthe community.\nG.

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\n\nlil. The Government’s Plan to Review Certain Files from the Florida Investigation\nA. Relevant Background Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

I'm not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than\nobviously Virginia who was l7 at this point?\n\n(Ex. lo at 382:4-384:2o).\n\nThe defendant argues that this question was “grossly ambiguous: who was ‘Jeffrey’; what\nwere ‘Jeffrey’s properties;’ to what time frame did the question apply; what was the basis for Ms.\nMaxwell to determine who may or may not have been ‘under the age of l8’; and what did ‘interact\nwith’ mean?” (Def. Mot. 4 at ll). These arguments only underscore the principle that perjury\nprosecutions are an inquiry into “the natural meaning in the context in which words were used,”\nBonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l, and not an opportunity for defense counsel to “plumb[] a question\nfor post hoc ambiguity,” Strohm, 67l F.3d at ll78. A reasonable jury, after hearing the evidence,\ncould readily conclude that the natural meaning of those words in context is abundantly clear. For\ninstance, at the end of trial, a jury could conclude that “Jeffrey” is Jeffrey Epstein; “Jeffrey’s\nproperties” are Jeffrey Epstein’s properties, including his houses in Palm Beach, New York, New\nMexico, and the United States Virgin Islands (see, e.g., Ex. lo at 248:l7-2o (naming those\nproperties)); and “interact” is an expansive word aimed at capturing any encounter, that was used\nafter the defendant resisted words like “met,” “found,” and “hired” in the prior questions, see\nInteract, Oxford English Dictionary Online, htps://oed.com/view/Entry/975l8 (last visited\nFebruary 25, 2o2l) (“To act reciprocally, to act on each other.”). Such inferences will be\nparticularly easy for a jury to reach after hearing multiple victims testify about their oun\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 239\nspecific than the District where the offense was allegedly commited.”). Rather, “[c]ourts have\nbroad latitude in defining the geographic area from which juries will be selected.” United States\nv. Yonkers Contracting Co., Inc., 682 F. Supp. 757, 768 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Consistent with the\nforegoing, the SDNY Jury Plan creates two separate Master Wheels—one for the White Plains\ncourthouse and one for the Manhatan courthouse, each of which draws from certain counties, with\nsome overlapping counties. SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o. Under the\nrelevant jury plan, jurors for trials held in Brooklyn were drawn from the entire Eastern District,\nwhile jurors for trials held in the “Long <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Division,” which included the Uniondale\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 239\ncourthouse, were drawn from Nassau and Suffolk Counties. /d. at 24. The defendant argued that\nthe district court erred by selecting the jury from the “Long <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Division” wheel because there\nwas under-representation of Blacks and Hispanics in that “division” as compared to the Eastern\nDistrict as a whole. /d. at 23-24. The Second Circuit rejected the argument, finding that it “[wa]s\nbased upon an improper premise.” /d. at 24. Contrary to the defendant’s claims, “[w]here a jury\nvenire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to see whether there\nhas been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd. (emphasis added).\n\nConsistent with Bahna, courts have repeatedly found that defendants in criminal cases have\nno constitutional or statutory right to a jury drawn from the entire district or from a particular\ngeographic area within a district, such as the county or “division” where the offense was\ncommited. See, e.g., Rutenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 48o, 482 (l9l8) (rejecting claim that\ndefendant had Sixth Amendment right to jury drawn from entire district); United States v. Miller,\nll6 F.3d 64l, 659 (2d Cir. l997) (“‘Th[e] [Sixth] Amendment’s guarantees of an impartial jury ‘of\nthe State and district’ in which the crime was commited does not require a narrouer geographical\nfocus than the district itself.”); United States v. Richardson, 537 F.3d 95l, 959 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (a\ncriminal defendant “does not have a right to have his trial in or jurors summoned from a particular\ndivision of the state and district where the crime was commited”); United States v. Herbert, 698\nF.2d 98l, 984 (9th Cir. l983) (finding that “[a] petit jury may be drawn constitutionally from only\none division and not the whole district”); Zicarelli v. Dietz, 633 F.2d 3l2, 3l8 (3d Cir. l98o)\n(“[T]there is no constitutional right to a jury chosen from the division where the offense was\ncommited or from the entire district which includes that division.”); United States v. Florence,\n456 F.2d 46, 49-5o (4th Cir. l972) (holding that a defendant has no constitutional or statutory right\nto a jury selected from the entire district or from a particular division).\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 239\n\nit is inapposite as well: both cases appear to concern instances in which the grand jury and trial\njury sat in the same courthouse, and thus there was no cause to consider whether the same\n“community” was relevant to separate challenges to the grand and petit juries. See United States\nv. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); United States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp.\n869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. l995). As such, neither case supports the proposition that where a\ndefendant is challenging the selection of the grand jury, the relevant “community” is the\npopulation of the location in which her trial will be held. Such a comparison is unjustified, as\nBahna makes clear: That case appears to involve conduct that occurred in Brooklyn, appears to\nhave been indicted in Brooklyn, was originally tried in Brooklyn, and was later transferred to\nUniondale, where it was tried with a jury drawn from the “Long <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Division.” Yet the Second\nCircuit rejected the defendant’s claimed entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s\nhere—was based on a flawed premise.\n\nThe defendant’s proposed rule—comparing the composition of the grand jury venire to the\npopulation of the expected trial location—makes litle legal or practical sense. Where, as here,\nthe defendant’s challenge is to the indictment, the proceeding for which the defendant is entitled\nto expect a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community is not the trial, but the grand\njury proceeding itself. Indeed, that must be the case, as it is not yet determined where the trial in\nthis mater will in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial will ultimately be held at the\nManhatan courthouse. While that is /ikely to be the case, it is not necessarily so. Bahna again\nillustrates the point, as a case originally tried in Brooklyn was reassigned to Uniondale for the\nretrial “to accommodate trial congestion in the court’s calendar during a period of judicial\nemergency... .” United States v.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

The State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies\n\nFlorida state criminal prosecutions are primarily managed by an Office of State Atorney\nin each of the state’s 2o judicial circuits, headed by a State Atorney who is elected to a four-year\nterm. Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nI. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- oooo323l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!®°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'*’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003576.jpg": "Case l:25-cvOo43G4RAP Dodooureent264-l6 FHdddlOA/2?67/2l Pagagk82lool43\nPage l37\nl G Maxwell - Confidential\n2 the flights?\n3 A.

When Jane Doe #3\nbegan giving Epstein a “massage,” Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as\nthey had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and\nwith the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”\nEpstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about l999 through 2oo2, when she managed to\nescape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From\nl999 through 2oo2, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm\nBeach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on\nhis Epstein’s private planes, and elsewhere.\n\nEpstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to\npolitically-connected and financially-pouerful people.

Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual\nrelations with Dershouitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but\nalso on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to\nbeing a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshouitz was an eye-witness\nto the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators.\nDershouitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.\nIndeed, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5. Thus, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement with a\nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for\nsexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if\ndisclosed, Dershouitz (along with other members of Epstein’s defense team) and the\nGovernment tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims and the\ngeneral public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in\nEpstein’s sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity\ngranted by the NPA for the crimes she commited in Florida. In addition to participating in the\nsexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures\n\n4\nGIUFFRE oo429l\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo374o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 5 of l4\nof underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3.

For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls).

Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\nBrunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees.

During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility. The current\nSheriff has served continuously since January 2oo5.\n\nIl. THE SUBJECT ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE EPSTEIN CASE\n\nR. Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 56 of 349\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.””\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l28 of 349\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the ‘“‘watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl5? Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l45 of 349\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was “fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4442", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004667.jpg": "——-  .

Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible\nprejudice against probative force under Rule 4o3 . . . exercises more control over experts than over\nlay witnesses.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595 (quoting authority omited).\n\nAmong other things, the Court “must consider whether an expert’s proposed testimony\nwould usurp the province of the judge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual\ndeterminations.” <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Intell.

While Federal Rule of Evidence\n7o4(a) provides that “[a]n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue,”\nthe Second Circuit has admonished courts to take care “lest [the expert] be alloued to usurp the\nfunction of the judge.” Marx & Co. v. Diners Club, Inc., 55o F.2d 5o5, 5ll (2d Cir. l977).\nAccordingly, courts must not admit “opinions which would merely tell the jury what result to\nreach.” Hygh v. Jacobs, 96l F.2d 359, 363-64 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o4 advisory\ncommitee’s note); see also United States v.

Nor may an expert opine as to a party’s state of mind, credibility, intent, or motive. See\nLaSalle Bank Nat’! Ass’n v.

Dr. Dietz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself\nwith people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that he was able to “use his brilliance to\nmanipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which\nnone had complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. Dietz has absolutely no basis\nto make such broad and sweeping factual claims about Epstein or his relationships with anyone,\nmuch less anyone in this case. It appears that Dr. Dietz has reached his conclusions based solely\non one interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in which Epstein “acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged in discovery (Def. Expert\nNotice Ex. C, atached as Exhibit B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests\nthat Epstein looked to the halos of others, not that he generated one himself. And it is no basis, at\nall, for Dr. Dietz to suggest to the jury that anyone involved in this case did anything because of\nEpstein’s “halo.”\n\nThis factual narration of Epstein’s life and apparently the lives of other people who\ninteracted with him, a defense summation based on a nullification defense masquerading as an\nexpert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence, and in any event is patently not\nthe product of reliable psychiatric methods reliably applied to this case. See, e.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Intell.\n> This would not be the first unreliable factual claim made by Dr. Dietz, who testified in a previous\ncriminal case that a defendant got the idea of drouning her children in the bathtub from an episode\nof Law & Order in which a defendant did so and was acquited on an insanity defense, when in\nfact no such episode existed. See generally e.g., Barnete v. United States, No. l2 Civ. 327, 2o2l\nWL 949848, *9-lo (W.D.N.C. March l2, 2o2l). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of\nthe defendant in that case. See Yates v. State, l7l S.W.3d 2l5, 222 (Tex. App. 2oo5).\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4. Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n\ne Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert.

During the course of your graduate studies at the\n\nl7 University of Rhode <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>, what if any topics in particular\nl8 did you focus on?\n\nl9 A. I focused in particular on areas related to social\n2o psychology, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and\n2l eating disorders.\n22 Q. What is traumatic stress?\n23 A. \"Traumatic stress\" refers to a stressor that overwhelms an\n24 individual's person -- ability to cope.

Moreover, a limiting instruction would be insufficient to overcome the jury’s likely\nstrong emotional response to Accuser-3’s testimony, leaving a substantial risk that the jury would\nmisapply this evidence and convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper basis.

The defense proposes the follouing instruction, which is modeled on the proposed\ninstruction for Accuser-3:\nYou have heard testimony from this witness about sexual activity\nbetween her and Jeffrey Epstein that occurred [choose all that\napply: in Florida when she was above the age of l8; in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands when she was above the age of l8; in New York\nwhen she was above the age of l7; in New Mexico when she was\nabove the age of l6; in the United Kingdom when she was above\nthe age of l6].\nFor the purposes of your deliberations, I instruct you that at all\ntimes relevant to this case the legal age of consent for sexual\nactivity [choose all that apply: in Florida was l8 years old; in the\nU.S. Virgin Islands was l8 years old; in New York was l7 years\nold; in New Mexico was l6 years old; in the United Kingdom was\nl6 years old].\nIf you find that the witness engaged in sexual activity after she was\nabove the relevant age of consent, I instruct you that any such\nsexual activity was lawful and cannot be considered “illegal” or\n“criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in the\nindictment.\nIV.  Accuser-3 Cannot Be Considered a “Victim” for Any Legal Purpose\nThe Court ruled at the November lo\" hearing that Accuser-3 could not be considered a\n“victim” of the crimes charged in the S2 Indictment and that the government should not refer to\nher as a “victim” or a “minor.” Accordingly, there is no need for the defense to respond to the\ngovernment’s November 7\" Leter.\nRespectfully submited,\n__/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

Clinical psychology is the study of human thoughts and\n2l behaviors, both abnormal and normal. We also study\n22 psychopathology, treatment methods. But it's generally the\n23 study of human behavior.\n24 Q.

Sure. So in a doctoral program such as the one I atended,\n2 it's the scientist-practitioner model. So I took about three\n3 to four years of coursework in a broad range of subject\n\n4 maters, such as assessment and treatment, psychopathology,\n\n5 ethics, professional practice, family systems, forensic\n\n6 psychology, tests and measurements, things like that, as well\n7 as specialty courses, electives, if you will, in areas of\n\n8 particular interest to me, which would have included at the\n\n9 time hostility and violence in the lives of women, psychology\nlo of poverty, forensic psychology.\n\nll In addition to the structured coursework, we, during\nl2 the graduate period, took courses in methods of practice, saw\nl3 patients, and had clinical supervision, again in a variety of\nl4 types of treatment. So individual therapy, marital couple\n\nl5 therapy, for example.\n\nl6 Q. During the course of your graduate studies at the\n\nl7 University of Rhode <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>, what if any topics in particular\nl8 did you focus on?\n\nl9 A. I focused in particular on areas related to social\n2o psychology, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and\n2l eating disorders.\n22 Q. What is traumatic stress?\n23 A. \"Traumatic stress\" refers to a stressor that overwhelms an\n24 individual's person -- ability to cope. In the DSM-V it's\n25 defined as a stressor that is severe enough, quite severe, and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page l3 of l59l2\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl I then also spent another six months working at the\n\n2 Yale Psychiatric Institute on an inpatient and partial hospital\n3 unit, treating adolescents.

After you received your Ph.D., what did you do next in your\n7 career?\n\n8 A. I had a full-year equivalent of a postdoctoral fellouship.\n9 During that year I worked in a partial hospital program. I\n\nlo treated patients in an outpatient psychotherapy practice, and I\nll taught courses at the college level in psychology.\n\nl2 Q. Where did you do your postdoctoral fellouship?\n\nl3 A. It was in Rhode <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>. I worked in a private practice\n\nl4 seting in Rhode <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>, as well as Butler Hospital.\n\nl5 Specifically I worked in a partial hospital program that\n\nl6 utilized dialectical behavior therapy in the treatment of\n\nl7 women.\n\nl8 Q. What issues did you focus on during your postdoctoral\n\nl9 fellouship?\n2o A.

Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.

Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7.

As a\nresult, the jury heard a great deal of testimony from Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer, as well as\nother evidence, about conduct that took place in Epstein’s residences in New Mexico, London,\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and, of course, Florida. Indeed, a large portion of Jane’s testimony,\nwhich was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies, described incidents of sexual abuse in\nEpstein’s residence in Palm Beach that involved no interstate travel. (Tr. 298-3l5).\nAccordingly, the geographic scope of Count Five (Florida) was included within the geographic\nscope of Count Three.\n\nCount Five did not describe a separate, independent conspiracy. Rather, it was a smaller\nsubset of the broader overarching conspiracy charged in Count Three. Counts Three and Five\nare therefore multiplicitous. See United States v. Calderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. l992)\n(finding two conspiracies were multiplicitous where, among other things, the time frame and\ngeographic scope of one conspiracy was entirely contained within the other conspiracy and the\ncore participants were the same); see also id. at 48 (“The Government cannot be permited to\nretry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies, wholly contained within the scope of a\nlarge conspiracy, until it finds one small enough to be proved to the satisfaction of a jury.’’).\n\nC. Common Overt Acts\n\nThe government argues that the lack of common overt acts between Count Three and\nCount Five indicates that they were different conspiracies. (Opp. at 3o). As we explained in our\ninitial Motion, because Count Five was based on Carolyn’s allegations and did not involve Jane,\nKate, or Annie Farmer, that count alleged overt acts specific to Carolyn that were not alleged in\nCount Three. (Mot. at 24; Ind. 9] 25a-d, l9a-e). Nevertheless, because the conspiracy charged\nin Count Five was a subset of the conspiracy charged in Count Three, as discussed above, the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo286", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 24\novert acts alleged in Count Five could easily have been alleged in Count Three because they\nwere in furtherance of the same conspiracy. Hence, the differing overt acts do not indicate\ndifferent conspiracies. See Calderone, 982 F.2d at 48 (finding two conspiracies were\nmultiplicitous even though twenty-one overt acts listed in the second conspiracy were not listed\nin the first, because they were “all in furtherance of the broader conspiracy alleged in the first’’).\n\nD. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of\n\nInterdependence\n\nFinally, the government argues that Counts Three and Five were different conspiracies\nbecause they were “fundamentally independent schemes, with different objectives and modes of\noperation.” (Opp. at 32). In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the conspiracy. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\nconspiracy charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘massage appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. l52l-23,\nl537). She also testified that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell asked her to travel to his <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>. (Tr.\nl534-35). Similarly, payment and massages were not exclusive to Count Five. Jane testified\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2l of 45\nencouraged her to massage Epstein’s feet, and that the Defendant then gave her a massage during\nwhich the Defendant touched Annie’s breasts. /d. at 2o83-86. As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. She contends that the\njury convicted her of intending that Jane engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, rather than\nNew York, thus resulting in a constructive amendment of the Indictment, or in the alternative, a\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 25 of 29\nCounts Three, Four, and Six already includes the concept of “unduly influenc[ing] a minor to\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct.” The enhancement therefore should not be applied to any\nof the three offense groups.\n\nSecond, under the 2oo3 Guidelines, which should apply in this case, the analogous two-\npoint enhancement only applies if “a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage\nin a commercial sex act.’ USSG § 2Gl.l(b)(4)(B) (2oo3) (emphasis added). There is no\nevidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, the\nenhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups l| and 2).\n\nThird, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly influenced” to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nUSSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), Appl.

Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks\nomited). Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage\nEpstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself\nand recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. l527-28,\nl543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein\nwithout being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. l548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not\nso influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her. Carolyn\ntestified that she refused their offers to have her travel with them to Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>. (Tr. l534-\n35).

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “massage.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his\nprivate <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7).

(/d.).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, the defendant and Epstein entered a new phase\nof their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a l7-year-old\ngirl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Epstein with massages.\n(PSR § 56). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized\nmassages at his Palm Beach residence, in exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each\nmassage. (PSR § 55). Virginia also traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations,\nincluding New York and the Virgin Islands, on Epstein’s private plane. (PSR 457). Virginia\nbrought other teenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (PSR 458). One of those girls was a\nl4-year-old girl named Carolyn who Virginia introduced to the defendant and Epstein at the Palm\nBeach villa in 2ool. (PSR ff 58, 59). Thus began the pyramid scheme phase of the defendant and\nEpstein’s abuse of teenage girls.\n\n5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn\n\nCarolyn visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence more than loo times, during each of which\nshe was sexually abused during paid sexualized massages. (PSR 59). Carolyn met the defendant\nthe very first time she went to Epstein’s house, and she interacted with the defendant multiple\ntimes thereafter. (/d.). On Carolyn’s first visit to the house, the defendant greeted Virginia, who\nintroduced Carolyn to the defendant. (PSR { 62). The defendant then told Virginia, “You can\nbring her upstairs and shou her what to do,” after which Virginia shoued Carolyn hou to perform\na sexual massage on Epstein. (PSR {| 62-63).

There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v.

Clinic Recs., 5o4 F. Supp. 2d at lo9o (quashing subpoena in part where, by\ncomplying, state “would be violating its oun laws”). Because compliance would be\nunreasonable or oppressive, this Court should quash the subpoena.\n\nCompliance would also be unreasonable or oppressive because all the information\nMaxwell seeks is “otherwise procurable” or, indeed, already in Ms. Maxwell’s possession.

Instead, she decided to direct her subpoena at a different source: the EVCP’s\nadministrator. While the EVCP cannot divine the reason behind that shift in legal strategy, it\nappears as if she is atempting to do an end run around the Court’s prior rulings or believes that\nrenewing those requests will be unfruitful. The EVCP is not suggesting that Ms. Maxwell renew\nher earlier requests directed at EVCP claimants. The EVCP believes that no participant should\nbe required to turn over their confidential submissions against their wishes. But there are\nalternative ways to obtain the information she seeks, such as on cross-examination at trial, to the\nextent permissible.

With that confidentiality imperative in mind, we designed the EVCP Protocol\nwith input and support from the victims’ lawyers, the Atorney General of the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Epstein’s estate is being probated); a copy of the\ncourt order is included with this motion as Exhibit G. The Protocol sets out the terms, conditions\nand guiding principles that govern the Program, the claims process and my role and\nresponsibilities as independent Administrator. In accordance with the Protocol, I had complete\nand exclusive autonomy and decision-making authority over all claim determinations and all\nclaim procedures. The Estate agreed to pay whatever amounts I determined in my independent\njudgment to eligible claimants in exchange for the claimant releasing the Estate and other related\nindividuals and entities from any civil claims relating to the allegations of sexual abuse. The\nProtocol, as well as other information about the EVCP, is publicly available on its website at\nhtps://epsteinvep.com/, and the Protocol is atached to the motion as Exhibit D.\n\n9. Confidentiality is an indispensable condition of the EVCP; its importance cannot\nbe overstated. The EVCP Protocol expressly requires confidentiality in order to protect the\nprivacy of claimants. In accordance with the Protocol, information provided to or obtained by\nthe Program was used by me, in my role as Administrator, for the sole purpose of processing and\nevaluating claims and performing other Program-related work (such as resolution of any related\nMedicaid and/or Medicare liens). It was otherwise kept - and must remain - confidential. The\nProtocol provides that the Program’s files are not available for inspection or review at any time,\nand that no information obtained solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page4of7\nby the Estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum. And the Protocol expressly\nauthorizes the destruction of Program files to protect the privacy of claimants participating in the\nProgram.\n\nlo. —_ In addition to the Protocol, I testified in open court in the Probate Court in the\nU.S. Virgin Islands about the confidentiality requirement imposed on the Program, as did\nKenneth R. Feinberg, who was a Co-Designer of the EVCP. A copy of relevant excerpts of the\ntranscript is atached to the motion as Exhibit H, and the relevant testimony appears at pages\nll:l-ll:l6, ll8:9-ll8:24 (my testimony) and pages l7o:25-l7l:25, l8o:23-l82:8 (Mr.\nFeinberg’s testimony). I posted FAQs on the EVCP website that address the scope and\nassurance of confidentiality. A copy of the EVCP FAQs is atached to the motion as Exhibit E\n(see Questions 5, 6 and ll). I also issued several press releases during the claims process that\nhighlight confidentiality as a “cornerstone” of the EVCP and of “paramount importance.”\nCopies of EVCP press releases are atached as Exhibits B, C, and F. Through numerous public\nforums, confidentiality was discussed as a centerpiece of the Program.\n\nll. The express condition of confidentiality significantly informed the way I\nadministered the Program and approached the claims process. I implemented a trauma-informed\nprocess where claimants could share information freely and openly without feeling the need to\ncensor themselves - not only about the events that gave rise to the claim but also the often\nprofound impact on their lives. I spent months building trust and confidence in this alternative\ndispute resolution process among claimants and their atorneys — a process that was new and\nunfamiliar to many of them. I dispensed with formal rules of procedure or evidence that would\napply in a court of law in favor of a less formal, non-adversarial approach. And I implemented\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of7\nextensive measures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all information submited to,\nmaintained by, exchanged with and distributed by the Program.\n\nl2. With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very foundation\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information. The idea that the information the victims agreed to\ndisclose to the EVCP solely for purposes of evaluation and potential resolution of the claim\nwould be disclosed to anyone outside the EVCP for any other purpose is anathema to the\nintegrity of this Program and others like it. The Program and Protocol were approved by a court\norder from the Probate Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands and I abided by the terms and guiding\nprinciples of the Protocol in every way and at every step of the process. Failing to abide by any\nterm of the Protocol, much less the keystone condition of confidentiality, is intolerable,\nimpermissible, and would lead to the unraveling of the Program. Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-2 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagepk@frbit p\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November l4, 2ol9\nAdministrator Jordana H.

Ms. Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros will draft the program protocol and will\nafford interested parties, including potential claimants and/or their legal representatives, an opportunity to provide\ninput on the protocol prior to its finalization. They expect that, once approved by the Court, the program will start\naccepting claims in approximately 9o days.\n“This important program will offer victims the opportunity to obtain long-overdue compensation, to be heard and\ntreated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve, and to achieve some measure of justice and\nvalidation that has eluded them for so many years. The claims resolution process will be fair, prompt, and non-\nadversarial, and will provide victims with a meaningful alternative to years of protracted civil litigation and its\nassociated costs, risks and uncertainties,” said Ms. Feldman.\nMs. Biros added that “participation in the program will be entirely voluntary and will not affect any rights the\nclaimant may have unless and until she accepts the compensation determination and signs a litigation release. All\nclaimants will be afforded an opportunity to meet confidentially with the Administrator, if they so desire, in order\nto provide any information that may bear upon the evaluation of their claims.”\nMs. Feldman, who recently served as Deputy Special Master of the September llth Victim Compensation Fund,\nthe litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who\nhave become sick or died as a result of their September l lth-related exposure, will also administer the new program.\nMs. Feldman will, in the role of Administrator, have complete autonomy and decision-making authority over\nprogram operations and claim determinations, and the Estate will have no authority to modify or reject\nMs. Feldman’s decisions on any basis or as to any claim. Mr. Feinberg, the nation’s leading expert in fashioning\neffective dispute resolution alternatives, and his colleague, Ms. Biros, will partner with Ms. Feldman in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the program, lending their extensive expertise to that process.\nMr. Feinberg added, “We are pleased to have been asked to implement this important program, and are eager to\nbegin designing it so that claimants will have a forum where their suffering is acknouledged and their claims are\npromptly and appropriately compensated.” Regarding Ms. Feldman he said, “Jordy brings not only a wealth of\nexperience from her long-time work with the 9/ll community, but also a profound sense of empathy for victims\nand a deep commitment to ensuring fairness in process and outcome.”\nOnce approved, the program will operate and maintain a website that provides general information about the\nprogram, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, information about claims filing deadlines and a\nregistration process for new complaints.

The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program\nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.\nFeldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from atorneys representing over 7o victims, the Atorney\nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be\nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the “Administrator’), the former Deputy Special Master of the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the\nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of\ntheir September llth-related exposure.\n“This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of\npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknouledgment by an independent third party as to\nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.\n“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is\ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the\nyears of pain these victims have endured.”\n“These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,” said Mr.\nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs\nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, among others.\nThe Program provides victims with an atractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is\nspeedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts,\nDOJ-OGR-oooll475", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-3 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of3\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior setlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary\nrequirements.\n\nImportant features of the Program include:\n\nl. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign. My staff is deeply sensitive to the unique circumstances involved and is commited to\nprocessing the victims’ claims in a prompt, fair and effective manner,” said Ms. Feldman.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page9of9\nmediation privileges, setlement privileges and other privileges apply.\nTo protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by\nthe Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of\nthe Program.\nIndividual Claimants are not bound through the Program by any rules of confidentiality.

Other Program Information\n\nl. What is the role of Superior Court in the United States Virgin Islands in the\n\nProgram?\nThe Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Probate Division) (“Probate\nCourt”) is the court where the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is being probated. The\nProbate Court approved the Program on June 3, 2o2o. The signed Order is\navailable to view online. Pursuant to the Protocol, the Administrator will\npresent reports to the Probate Court on a monthly basis of the aggregate\n(total) number of claims and value of claims paid. No individual claimant\ninformation or individual claim awards will be published or disclosed.\n\n2. What role does Professor Marci A. Hamilton play in the Program?\n\nProfessor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nserves as a consultant to and resource for the Administrator and her staff. In\ncertain circumstances, at the discretion of the Administrator and with the\nClaimant’s prior writen consent, the Administrator may share the Claimant’s\nfile with Professor Hamilton for her review and the Claimant may request\nthat Professor Hamilton participate in a meeting with the Claimant with the\nAdministrator. Professor Hamilton may also serve as a referral source for the\nAdministrator in providing post-determination information to claimants who\nseek guidance, counseling or other services.\n\n3. Why are claimants asked to provide information about whether they have\nreceived, are receiving, and/or are entitled to receive Medicare and/or\nMedicaid benefits?\n\nIn some cases, Medicare Part A and/or Part B (“Medicare”) and/or Medicaid\nmay assert a reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation\nawarded to an individual Claimant under the Program. As part of the claims\nresolution process, the Program has retained the services of a third-party\nvendor, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. d/b/a Epiq Mass Tort (“Epiq’), to\nverify and resolve such reimbursement claims or liens asserted by Medicare\nand/or Medicaid related to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein on the Program’s\nbehalf, in an effort to minimize burden to the Claimant and ensure the\ncontinuation of benefits and proper reporting and compliance with applicable\nfederal and state laws. With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the Administrator.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-7 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel QeHIBIT G\nIN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS\nDIVISION OF ST.

EVERDELL: I think that's right, your Honor.\n\n6 Let's give an example, because I think it's helpful to\n7 use examples. I'll use one from this very case.\n\n8 It's my understanding that the government wants to\n\n9 introduce certain FedEx records through a FedEx document\n\nlo custodian. The defense also would like to introduce other\n\nll FedEx records, coincidentally, through the same document\n\nl2 custodian.

That would be\n\nl5 defense case-in-chief material which, by the way, we disclosed\nl6 in our Rule l6 leter to the government. That's an example, I\nl7 think, where the courts are talking about where you disclose\n\nl8 things -- where you have a witness where you are trying to put\nl9 on affirmative proof in the defense case through the\n2o government's witness. That is an example where we don't\n2l dispute.\n22 T'll give another example. This is a hypothetical\n23 one. Larry Visoski just testified.

But\n9 at this point the vast majority of individuals who hire me are\nlo atorneys.\nll Q. And are those atorneys on just the plaintiff's side or can\nl2 you explain that for the jury.\nl3 A. Sure. So when I'm working in a criminal arena, I might be\nl4 hired by the prosecution or I might be hired by the defense.\nl5 And if I'm working in a civil case, again, I might be hired by\nl6 the person who's working on behalf of the plaintiff or the\nl7 person who's working on behalf of the defense.\nl8 As a forensic psychologist, I'm coming in and\nl9 providing an independent evaluation. So I'll work for all\n2o sides of -- all parties of a case.\n2l Q. Dr. Rocchio, what licenses do you hold?\n22 A.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the\n\n3 defense confuses conspiracy violations and substantive\n\n4 violations. There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 conspiracy count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting instruction for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>.

So there's no connection to New York law with respect\n7 to Annie's testimony either.\n\n8 And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those\n9 two witnesses' testimony, Kate and Annie, or even Carolyn, the\nlo object of this conspiracy, for this to be a crime, it can only\nll be hung on the testimony, at least in the evidence in the\n\nl2 record, the testimony of Jane. And --\n\nl3 THE COURT: You're doing precisely what Mr. Rohrbach\nl4 said, which is you're switching back and forth between the\n\nl5 conspiracy and the substantive count. So Annie, for example,\nl6 the evidence is the conduct occurred in New Mexico. That's why\nl7 I gave the limiting instruction. But that could be considered\nl8 with other evidence of the conspiracy with respect to New York,\nl9 the violation of New York law. You don't have to have the\n2o violation of New York law to establish the elements of the\n2l conspiracy count.\n22 So the objection is overruled.\n23 Next.\n24 MR. EVERDELL: All right.

Why not subpoena the United States\nVirgin <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>’s officials that were working with Epstein to allou him to further his sex-\ntrafficking of girls across inter-continental and international lines? “Jeffrey Epstein used the\nmoney Black paid him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands.” [htps://\nwww.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/follouing-new-epstein-revelations-wyden-\nrenews-demand-for-trump-administration-to-produce-epstein-files]\nWhy not subpoena the long-time atorney and accountant Epstein had working by his side? Once .\nagain, I just feel like the direction this administration is going is all wrong. AND, what was it\nthat his accountant took from his 7lst Street NY mansion the day after he “killed himself’?\nhtps ://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-74989o3/Executor-Epsteins-estate-removed-bag-\npedophiles-mansion-day-killed-himself- html\nIn terms of the audio file that will most likely be redacted once again scrubbing the names of the\nwealthy and such off the recordings is once again NOT transparency. Unfortunately, the public\nwill never be satisfied and the victims will continue to live this nightmare. I am so confused.\nWhy rewind and go back to the convicted sex trafficker for questioning after all these almost 4\nl of 2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5ll5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015116.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page 2l of 27\nAugust 5, 2o25\nyears since she was convicted? What was there to ask? What are you conspiring? What is your\nnext step? What is the end game? I ask the United States Government, that so rightfully wants to\nrelease the “sealed” documents not all the victims have seen themselves. At least give us notice\nwhen you decide to make these decisions, like moving her into a minimum-security prison camp.\nI think the victims have a right to hear the audio without redactions. I think the victims should\nbe able to see what the FBI took from his, NYC mansion, FL mansion and USVI private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>\nresort. I think we should be able to see ALL the files. J think any photos or videos of the victims\nshould be given back to them. NOT REVIEWED BY CONGRESS, GROSS!!!!\nWill justice ever be served? I question what that would look like to the DOJ, the FBI, because so\nfar we have got nothing, not even an apology, not even the answers we so long for. We all want\nclosure and for this “distraction” to stop! This is some type of psychological games, by keeping\nthe public ignorant. The very fact that something is secret means there is something to hide.\nI support the United States Senate Commitee on Finance lead by Senator Wyden, “Follou-the-\nMoney” Investigation of Epstein Finances. I thank him and his team for their work, but I request\nmore transparency. I think the victims lawyers should have access to all these findings. We have\na right to take legal action against these institutions and/or individuals involved in Epstein’s and\nco-conspirators crimes.\n\nIt has been super unfortunate the way the US Government has handle this ordeal. We as\nvictims want answers, but not only us, I think the general public is exhausted also by all of this.\nThe general public cares more about their oun personal wellbeing, right? Unfortunately, for us\nvictims, this story will NEVER go away. There will always be an interest in the case of Epstein\nand Maxwell. Ghislaine’s trial was based off of the fact that Jeffrey could never be tried and died\nby “killing himself’. Why oh why will we have to live with this conspiracy for the rest of our\nlives? Because they keep laboring the truth, scrubbing the data. It is so hurtful and a detriment to\nthe victims to continue disregarding our feeling, our traumas. Please I ask you to consider our\nwell-being first.

ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the\n\n3 defense confuses conspiracy violations and substantive\n\n4 violations. There does not have to be a proven violation of\n\n5 New York law as to any of the minor victims. It just has to be\n6 an agreement to accomplish that purpose. Carolyn, for\n\n7 instance, was invited to travel by the defendant. The jury can\n8 readily find that that invitation to travel included an\n\n9 invitation to New York, where the abuse would continue, as it\nlo did for Jane. Annie was in fact transported by the defendant\nll Epstein to New Mexico and New York. The jury could readily\n\nl2 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of\n\nl3 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse\nl4 her, including back in New York. These are available\n\nl5 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the\nl6 conspiracy count.\n\nl7 THE COURT: That's precisely why there was a different\nl8 limiting instruction for Annie than there was for Kate.\n\nl9 MR. EVERDELL: Well, your Honor, I would dispute the\n2o facts a litle bit there, because they said that Carolyn's\n2l testimony was that she was invited to travel to the <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>.\n22 She was not invited to travel anywhere; she specifically\n23 testified she was given an invitation to the <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>. That's\n24 not travel to New York. And her mother said she couldn't be\n25 able to go. So I don't think that is evidence -- if the object\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6936", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 95 2749\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl of the conspiracy is to violate New York law, then an\n\n2 invitation to an <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> that's not New York doesn't count.\n\n3 And also, an invitation to travel to New Mexico to do\n4 whatever it is they were planning on doing in New Mexico is\n\n5) also not a goal of violating New York law. I'm sorry, from\n\n6 Arizona. So there's no connection to New York law with respect\n7 to Annie's testimony either.\n\n8 And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those\n9 two witnesses' testimony, Kate and Annie, or even Carolyn, the\nlo object of this conspiracy, for this to be a crime, it can only\nll be hung on the testimony, at least in the evidence in the\n\nl2 record, the testimony of Jane. And --\n\nl3 THE COURT: You're doing precisely what Mr. Rohrbach\nl4 said, which is you're switching back and forth between the\n\nl5 conspiracy and the substantive count. So Annie, for example,\nl6 the evidence is the conduct occurred in New Mexico. That's why\nl7 I gave the limiting instruction. But that could be considered\nl8 with other evidence of the conspiracy with respect to New York,\nl9 the violation of New York law. You don't have to have the\n2o violation of New York law to establish the elements of the\n2l conspiracy count.\n22 So the objection is overruled.\n23 Next.\n24 MR. EVERDELL: All right.

The argument that\n2l Maxwell didn't knou what was happening in the houses that she\n22 managed and lived in with the man she was sleeping with, what\n23 was going on with young girls she met in person and interacted\n24 with frequently, that argument is absolutely absurd and you\n25 should reject it completely.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017103.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 82 of 257 29l6\nLCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger\n\nl We are not here to defend Jeffrey Epstein, he is not\n\n2 my client.

I'll use one from this very case.\n\n8 It's my understanding that the government wants to\n\n9 introduce certain FedEx records through a FedEx document\n\nlo custodian. The defense also would like to introduce other\n\nll FedEx records, coincidentally, through the same document\n\nl2 custodian.

That's an example, I\nl7 think, where the courts are talking about where you disclose\n\nl8 things -- where you have a witness where you are trying to put\nl9 on affirmative proof in the defense case through the\n2o government's witness. That is an example where we don't\n2l dispute.\n22 T'll give another example. This is a hypothetical\n23 one. Larry Visoski just testified.

At\n5 other times I might be hired by the state. For example, at one\n6 point in my career the state of Rhode <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> hired me to\n\n7 perform forensic evaluations on children and adolescents who\n\n8 had become involved with the juvenile justice department. But\n9 at this point the vast majority of individuals who hire me are\nlo atorneys.\nll Q. And are those atorneys on just the plaintiff's side or can\nl2 you explain that for the jury.\nl3 A. Sure. So when I'm working in a criminal arena, I might be\nl4 hired by the prosecution or I might be hired by the defense.\nl5 And if I'm working in a civil case, again, I might be hired by\nl6 the person who's working on behalf of the plaintiff or the\nl7 person who's working on behalf of the defense.\nl8 As a forensic psychologist, I'm coming in and\nl9 providing an independent evaluation. So I'll work for all\n2o sides of -- all parties of a case.\n2l Q. Dr. Rocchio, what licenses do you hold?\n22 A.

RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021227.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NR 3536o38, Page55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021229.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ary eae 3536o38, Paged/ of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 55 of 348\n\nLourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. ... The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”*\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l229", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021301.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel29 of 258\nSA-l27\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 348\n\nscheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing. As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve\nan expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by\nJanuary 4, 2oo8, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’°? The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago. [Belohlavek] told us solicitation [is] not\nregistrable. It turns out that the actual offense charged is.’”!°°\n\n5. January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\noO Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021318.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l44 3536o38, Pagel46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\n\ncooperation.'®° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia\npassed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'** By leter dated\nSeptember l, 2oo9, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision\nof the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein\nmaintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed\nsuch a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\n86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\ntsi The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We\nsaw the belou article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never\nheard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is prety unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other\nsupervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]\nNew York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a lou sentence because he was\ncooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she\nconfirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”\nl88 Black later wrote a leter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the\ndistance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the mater was ‘fully investigated,”\nEpstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021615.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO N-439 3536o39, Pagel85 of 2l7\n7o\nM6SQOmaxSl\nl Malyshev.

For over a decade, Maxwell\ntraveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his pri-\nvate planes and mingled with rich and famous people,\nwhile enjoying a life of extraordinary luxury. (Tr.96-\n99, 233-34, 3o3-o4, ll94). Maxwell and Epstein spent\ntime together in Epstein’s various properties, includ-\ning his mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhatan,\nhis villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his\napartment in Paris, and his private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands. (Tr.99). Maxwell also received a toun-\nhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York City,\nand Epstein transferred more than $23 million to Max-\nwell during the timeframe of the conspiracy. (Tr.ll94,\nl3lo-l7).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, Max-\nwell also supervised Epstein’s households as “the lady\nof the house.” (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of\nEpstein’s homes, she imposed strict rules for staff,\nsome of which were included in a household manual\ndictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence.\n(Tr.8o7-o8, 823-3l).\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure,\nMaxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s\nhomes. (Tr.784, 826). The household manual made\nclear that staff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say\nnothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (Tr.826). Maxwell directed Juan Alessi,\nthe former manager of Epstein’s Palm Beach villa, to\nspeak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look\nEpstein in the eyes.

Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by\nEpstein between the ages of l4 and l6 years old, and\nMaxwell was frequently in the room when the abuse\nhappened. (Tr.3o7-l5). Over time, the abuse escalated,\nas Epstein used vibrators on Jane, put his fingers in\nJane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face.\n(Tr.3l9-2o). Maxwell sometimes touched Jane, includ-\ning on her breasts, during these incidents. (Tr.3ll).\nJane also traveled with Maxwell (who assisted Jane in\nmaking travel arrangements) and Epstein to Epstein’s\ntounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New\nMexico, where she was sexually abused.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

Palm Beach County constitutes the l5th Judicial Circuit. Barry Krischer was the elected\nState Atorney for that circuit from l992 until January 2oo9. During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county. Through its Department of Corrections, the\nPBSO operates the Main Detention Center and, during the period relevant to this Report, housed\nminimum-security detainees, including those on work release, at its Stockade facility.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.jpg": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’3%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n32 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023067.jpg": "Lourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . .. The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023139.jpg": "scheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing.

On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.

January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: ““We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl32 Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.jpg": "cooperation.'°© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023417.jpg": "Chapter 5: The Events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, and Epstein’s Death\nI. Epstein Signs a New Last Will and Testament on August 8\nIn the weeks follouing Epstein’s death, multiple media outlets reported that Epstein signed a new Last Will\nand Testament on August 8, 2ol9. At least one media organization published a copy of the notarized\ndocument shouing that it was signed by Epstein and two of his atorneys and notarized on August 8, 2ol9.\nAtorney visitor logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York)\nconfirmed that those atorneys and the notary public visited Epstein on that date. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) confirmed via court records that the August 8, 2ol9 will and other probate-related\ndocuments were filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands on August l5, 2ol9. Among the court filings\nwas an affidavit from another atorney who stated that she received the August 8, 2ol9 will from Epstein.\nThe OIG confirmed via atorney visitor logs that this atorney also visited Epstein at MCC New York on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. The OIG's investigation and review revealed that MCC New York personnel were unaware\nthat Epstein had changed his will 2 days before he died.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she had heard that Epstein had changed his will from media reporting follouing\nhis death. The Chief Psychologist did not knou if the media reporting was accurate, but she thought that if\nit were true, it would have been useful information to knou because it would have been a red flag. The Staff\nPsychologist and the Chief Psychologist told the OIG that if Epstein’s atorneys had notified them or the\nPsychology Department that Epstein had changed his will, such information would have been a factor\nwarranting a review of Epstein’s mental state and Epstein probably would have been placed back on suicide\nwatch or some type of observation.\nIl. Court Order on August 9 Releasing Epstein-Related Documents in Pending\n\nCivil Litigation\nOn August 9, 2ol9, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of the summary\njudgment filings from a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged that\nEpstein had victimized her when she was a teenager, against Ghislaine Maxwell.?! As a result of the court's\norder, that same day approximately 2,ooo pages of documents were released into the public domain, which\ncontained considerable derogatory information about Epstein and some may have related to the criminal\ncharges pending against him. Additional high-profile public figures were also named in the released\ndocuments. There was significant media coverage of information contained within the unsealed\ncourt filings.\n3l Maxwell was subsequently indicted and, in December 2o2l, convicted of conspiring with Epstein to sexually\nabuse minors.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024820.jpg": "Page 282\nPSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH\nThis is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data.

BLOGS & STORIES\nBEAST Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\nby Conchita Sarnoff\nPAREN July 2o,2olo | l4:o5pm\n| Hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first\naccused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast’s\nConchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved\nhim from a long prison term. She reports:\n* Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an\nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.\n* Earlier versions of the U.S atorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have\nlanded Epstein in prison for 2o years.\n«Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former\nSoviet republics, including three l2-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.\n* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be\nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was\nconvicted of,\n* Epstein’s atorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered\nprivate investigators to follou and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n« Then-Atorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the\nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of\nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\nDuring Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\nCaribbean <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—l3 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was alloued out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has setled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $l million—an\namount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\nWith that, the knoun viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and\nmay weil follou Polanski into a luxurious exile.\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n, SIE-MAn- (o% op 356.T934>\nhtp:/Avww.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2olo-o7-2o/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2olo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo29o42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029055.jpg": ". _, Prince Andrew and girl, l7, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail On...

That decision upheld a zoning restriction on sex offenders living within 25oo feet of schools, parks,\nplaygrounds, public libraries, or day care centers. While other jurisdictions’ zoning laws currently restrict such\nindividuals from living within looo feet of these institutions, were they to follou the lead of Cherry Hill, New Jersey,\nthe client would most certainly be faced with the added burdens of selling his residences and moving in order to be in\ncompliance with the law.\n\no7/26/l7 Page l9 of l3l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030542.jpg": "|” 6, ‘Defendant Socdh Kellen is» cizen and sesident ofthe State of New York. |\n7.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nne /eibhw printhis.clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acthABeeHie Pa lo=The+Fantacick Pls Recoids, Request Nord Aho\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031408.jpg": "Received: l pares 3:l6PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 7 |\n. 8l/ll/2888 2l:48 56l64o442o x ies ony |\nwaterway to the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office, but the state atorney apparently saw the\nmain witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous |\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and |\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of |\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tumed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office handed doun one indictment of |\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>, Temple\nEmanu-E] (cirea the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . zy\nfounder Danny Abraham. Jose Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, “Half my —o |\nsources on the <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> are Jewish socialites.” (\\Q .. i—=> No ot CaP ane Bor fe yoeslee\nLambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have touho\ndo time. William Kennedy Smith in l99l, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction. 7 Ss\nMaybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein’s two big ap hd\ncharitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershouitz and Rubenstein are also major,\nIsrae] supporters. Dershouitz has writen a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Nou throu v\nin the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether (leak t\nEpstein was circumcised. “I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant,” the officer ate in :\nregard to the l4-year-old, ho wv «A a> WHA b\nOf course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from Je Wi A\nEdgar Allan Poe’s psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth’s sociological comedies. Epstein is —\nlicensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shouer on the first floor was\ngiven over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had\na Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Nou he was licensed\nin the Virgin Islands and gave his “permanent residence” as the same address as <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> Yachts.\nNotwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and\njoyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the\nsensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.\nhte eho orinthia.clickshilitv com/nt/entTackeieonee lle= Thet Rantseier EUG Recida Rewes!

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ...

But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating 2 plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\nEpstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzie and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah.” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdiy\n“He lives ina different environment,” says Sicgal. “He's of this world.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and ;\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of = #f\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tummed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney's office handed doun one indictment of\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032107.jpg": "leters to the alleged victims and their parents that justice was not served by the\nindictment and that the case has been referred to the FBI to determine if federal laws\nwere violated.\nEdmondson said Krischer's office reviewed the police evidence and decided to\ninvestigate further.\n\"The prosecutor looks at the witnesses and physical evidence from a broader view,”\nEdmondson said. \"Because of the nature of the allegations, in particular the lengthy\nsexual activity on part of the individuals and elements of financial reward to the\nindividuals, the case was referred to the grand jury.

While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man. To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. .\n\nPersonal History\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\nfrom which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033223.jpg": "client’s family office. The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033224.jpg": "Personal Characteristics\nFriendships. Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033228.jpg": "disciplined in business and conscientious.

Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n. At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n2 The Jeffrey Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. and the C.o.U.Q.

Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the .\nspotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.\nJeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the\nInstitute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,\n. sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and\nwomen’s groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which\n9\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33229", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033231.jpg": "Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n; Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did not have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

During the period relevant to this\nReport, the Palm Beach County State Atorney’s Office, based in the City of West Palm Beach,\nhad more than loo atorneys and several investigators, and a Crimes Against Children Unit headed\nby Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.\n\nThe incorporated Toun of Palm Beach occupies the coastal barrier <span class=\"highlight\">island</span> off the city of\nWest Palm Beach. Its law enforcement agency is the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD).\nMichael Reiter, who joined the PBPD in l98l, served as PBPD Chief from 2ool to February 2oo9.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office (PBSO), based in the City of West Palm Beach, is\nthe largest law enforcement agency in the county.

Alexander Acosta was appointed Interim U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida in June 2oo5, at age 36. In June 2oo6, President George W. Bush formally nominated\nAcosta, and after Senate confirmation, Acosta was sworn in as the U.S. Atorney in October 2oo6.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Acosta served a federal appellate clerkship; an l8-month\nterm as an associate at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C.; approximately four years\nas a policy fellou and law school lecturer; and nearly two years as a Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral in the Department’s Civil Rights Division. He was presidentially appointed in 2oo2 as a\nmember of the National Labor Relations Board, and in 2oo3 as Assistant Atorney General in\ncharge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, where he served from August 2oo3 until his\nappointment as Interim U.S. Atorney, and where he oversaw, among other things, the prosecution\nof human trafficking and child sex-trafficking cases. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta’s office was in the\nUSAO’s Miami headquarters, although he traveled to the USAO’s branch offices.\n\nDuring Acosta’s tenure as U.S. Atorney, the USAO initiated the federal investigation of\nEpstein, engaged in plea discussions with Epstein’s counsel, and negotiated the federal non-\nprosecution agreement (NPA) that is the subject of this Report. Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the federal investigation into Epstein’s conduct by allouing Epstein to enter a state plea.\nAcosta was personally involved in the negotiations that led to the NPA, reviewed various iterations\nof the agreement, and approved the final agreement signed by the USAO. Acosta continued to\nprovide supervisory oversight and to have meetings and other communications with Epstein’s\natorneys during the nine-month period between the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7,\nand Epstein’s entry of guilty pleas in state court pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on June 3o,\n2oo8.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.tif": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°8\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n39 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023067.tif": "Lourie folloued up his email to Villafafia with one to Menchel, in which Lourie reiterated\nthe potential benefits of a pre-indictment plea, explaining that he and Villafafia believed “the best\nthing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we decide to charge him. . .. The\n[sentencing] guidelines will be in the 2o year range, so we would need to plead him to one or two\nconspiracies to cap him and there is no telling if a judge would go for that once we indict.”\nMenchel responded that he and Acosta would read the prosecution memorandum and “[w]e can\ndiscuss after that.”\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia sent Lourie an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,\nexplaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’s potential sentencing exposure under the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines would be l68 to 2lo months, and that in her view, the facts warranted\nan upward departure from that range. Villafafia told OPR that although Lourie proposed some\nchanges to the draft indictment, at that point no one had told her that the evidence was insufficient\nto support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward with the case.\n\nIn an email to Acosta and Menchel on May ll, 2oo7, Lourie recommended charging\nEpstein by complaint and seeking a pre-indictment plea:\n\nMy current thoughts are that we should charge him. Not sure that I\nagree with the charging strategy as it is nou, but at this point I think\nwe only need to get on the same page as to whether the statutes cover\nthe conduct and whether the conduct is the type we should charge.\nI think the answer to both is yes, although there is some risk on some\nof the statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can\ndecide later what the [charging document] should look like precisely\nand which victims should be charged.\n\nI also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with a\ncomplaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to see if he wants\na pre-indictment resolution. That would give us more control [over]\na plea than if we indict him and need the court’s approval to dismiss\ncounts. We will need to cap him with conspiracy counts to make a\nplea atractive and the court could give us a hard time with that if we\ntry to dismiss indicted counts.\n\nAlthough her supervisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafafia\nwas unaware of those discussions and was frustrated that she was not receiving more feedback.\nShe continued preparing to charge Epstein. Two weeks after submiting the prosecution\nmemorandum, on May l4, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Lourie and Menchel by email that Epstein\nwas flying to New Jersey from the Virgin Islands, and she asked whether she could file charges\nthe next day. Menchel responded that “[y]ou will not have approval to go forward tomorrou,”\nand explained that Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but was at an out-of-toun conference,\nadding, “This is obviously a very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure\n43 Lourie told OPR that he was referring to one or two counts of conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general\n“omnibus” federal conspiracy statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023139.tif": "scheduled January 4, 2oo8 plea hearing.

On January 2, 2oo8, Sloman\nspoke with Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing\nhad been postponed. In an email reporting this to Acosta and Villafafia, Sloman said that Epstein’s\nlocal defense atorney Goldberger had told Belohlavek the postponement was because the facts\n“did not fit the proposed state charge,” and that Belohlavek told Sloman she agreed with that\nassessment.’ The next day, Villafafia sent to Acosta and Sloman a local newspaper article\nreporting that Epstein’s state plea hearing was reset for March and in exchange for it the federal\nauthorities would drop their investigation of him. Acosta also sent to Sloman and Villafafia an\nemail memorializing a statement made to him by Lefkouitz in a phone call that day: “‘I\n[Lefkouitz] may have made a mistake 6 months ago.

January 7, 2oo8: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes\n\nAdditional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman met with defense atorney Sanchez at her request.\nAccording to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the\nUSAO’s media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national\nnews reporter, and Sanchez “suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC\nby agreeing to a watered-doun resolution for Epstein.” After Acosta excused himself to atend\nanother meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez “without a witness present,”\nshe left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkouitz, and Sanchez,\nwho expressed concern about the “leak” to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA,\nand pressed for the “watered-doun resolution,” which they specified would mean allouing Epstein\nto plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register\nas a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman’s handwriten notes of the conversation\nreads: “We’re back to where we started in September.”\n\nThat evening, Villafafia expressed concern that the delay in resolving the mater was\naffecting the USAO’s ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his\nagreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein\nwas pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims,\ninterviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact\nwith “potential sources of information” in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to\nobtain Epstein’s computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a “soup to nuts”\nreview of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence\nVillafafia had compiled. He told OPR that he could not recall the reason for his review, but opined\nl59 Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall this incident, but she noted that the PBPD report did set forth\nfacts supporting the charge of procurement of a minor.\n\nl6o Although the meeting Lefkouitz had with Lourie, Villafafia, Krischer, and Belohlavek to discuss the state\nresolution was only four months prior, not six, Lefkouitz’s reference was likely to the September l2, 2oo7 meeting.\nlol\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.tif": "cooperation.'®© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcems about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n25o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25l In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027690.tif": "[CBP-2ol3-o229ll [Darren Indyke_|_—7/8/2ol3[closed | |\n\nCBP-2ol4-oo8o85 Darren K Indyke l/6/2ol4|Closed Duplicate Request || am an atorney submiting this request on behalf of my client, Jeffrey E.\nEpstein (a€ceEpsteina€fl Epstein is a natural person.

On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\nDuring Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\nCaribbean <span class=\"highlight\">island</span>. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—l3 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was alloued out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has setled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $l million—an\namount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\nWith that, the knoun viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward.

While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man, To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. :\n\nPersonal History ,\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span> section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\n. from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033223.tif": "client’s family office. The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033224.tif": "Personal Characteristics\nFriendships. Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney <span class=\"highlight\">Island</span>. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to charitable causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033228.tif": "disciplined in business and conscientious.

Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n° At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n?

Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the .\nspotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.\nJeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the\nInstitute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a Jong time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,\n. sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and\nwomen’s groups.

While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both financial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both financial and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n. Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did net have the financial resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee financial support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\n: ll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l"};
