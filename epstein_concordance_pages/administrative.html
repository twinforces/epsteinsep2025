The consistent practice of USAQs to limit the scope\nof plea agreements stands in stark contrast to the\nscope of the NPA here.\n\nThe trial court correctly noted that “[nJationwide,\nunlimited agreements are the rare exception.” (App.\nat 56a). The fact that this NPA is a “rare exception”\nto Department’s general practice does not void the\nagreement’s broad reach. In fact, the rarity of nationwide\nagreements is a persuasive reason to enforce it because\nthere can be no question that the choice of language was\nintentional and a key part of the parties’ bargain.\n\nThis situation is no different than a contractual\nprovision that binds a corporate subsidiary and, by\nextension, the parent corporation. Unless the subsidiary\nplainly lacked authority to enter into the agreement, that\nprovision is enforceable against the parent. Similarly, one\nUSAO has the authority to bind the entire Department.\n“(T]he prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the\nspokesman for the Government.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions’). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request.

Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2.

Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case.

In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.”**’ On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?°8\n266 H.

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short.

Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v.

In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d).

Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the nights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:*©°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nIl. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\nor OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l5 of 349\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6, 635 (l886)), and that “the Fifth Amendment\nis to be “broad[ly] constru[ed] in favor of the right which it was intended to secure.” /d. at\nlo64 (quoting Counselman v.

We stressed that “[t]he value\nof constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on\nthem.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 425 (l957) (Black,\nJ., concurring).2°\n\nThe right against compulsory self-incrimination accompanies a person wherever\nhe goes, no mater the legal proceeding in which he participates, unless and until “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exists.” Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo65. It\n26 To that end, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination is not limited\nto criminal maters. Its availability “does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its\nprotection is invoked, but upon the nature of the statement or admission and the exposure\nwhich it invites.” /d. (quoting Application of Gault, 387 U.S. l, 49 (l967)). “The privilege\nmay, for example, be claimed in a civil or <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> proceeding, if the statement is or\nmay be inculpatory.” Gault, 387 U.S. at 49.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 Filed ll/l5/2l Page6of43 6\nLalWmaxC\n\nl The jury department will provide the completed\n\n2 questionnaires to the U.S. Atorney's Office for copying.

Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as\nanxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are\ndirectly related to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her\n\nincreasing depression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to\n\nworsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions.\nExhibit J.\nPre-Sentence Detention Was Discriminatory\n\nIn this case, the conditions of detention for Ms. Maxwell were evidently discriminatory.\nConsidering her profile — her age, lack of violence or threat of danger to herself and others- the\nbrutality of her detention regime was completely unwarranted. The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related\ninformation, and she often received misinformation, i.e., the date by which she must file an\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> remedy.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 34 of 77\nsegregated due to the high-profile nature of her case is belied by the fact that the case and the\ninmate are still high profile, yet Ms. Maxwell is nou in general population.\n\nIf a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal — if it is arbitrary\nand purposeless- a court may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment and\nmay not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees. Bell v. Wolfish, 44l U.S. 52o, 539 (l979).\nFailing to implement reasonable alternatives suggests that the decision to keep her restricted was\nmade with no legitimate penological purpose and amounts to impermissible punishment.”\nProportionality Supports a Hard-Time Credit\n\nThe principle of proportionality — a core principle of the Eighth Amendment 7? and U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines 74 - requires that sentences should be relative to the crimes commited.”>\nThe Guidelines Manual states that one of the objectives at the core of the Sentencing Reform Act\nis “proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences\nfor criminal conduct of differing severity.” 7° If inmates in isolation or supermax detention suffer\n*? Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,\nand Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form\nof pretrial detention. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the\nunfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat\nsuch disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory pouers to permit BOP\nbureaucrats to exercise <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> measures without accountability.\n\n* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\ninflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xi.\n“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2o2l).\n*> See Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 284-9o (l983) (discussing the longstanding principle that a punishment\nshould be proportionate to the crime).\n°° USSG, Part A, §3. The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing\nsystem” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the pouer of the parole commission to reduce\nthe term to be served); (ll) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences\nfor similar offenses; and (i) proportionate sentences.

Her lawyers have not hesitated to alert the Court to\nissues requiring its atention, and the Court has ensured that the defendant was able to prepare for\ntrial and participate in her defense. In addition, the defendant has filed numerous <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span>\ncomplaints with the BOP, all of which have apparently been evaluated as unfounded. For example,\nthe Government understands from legal counsel at the MDC that the BOP has investigated the\ndefendant’s complaints of physical abuse and concluded that they are unfounded. Legal counsel\nat the MDC further informed the Government that all pat-doun searches of the defendant that took\nplace pretrial were, in fact, video recorded.\n\nTaken together with the defendant’s perjury in her civil deposition, her lies to Pretrial\nServices, and her blatant lies about her oun weight while in BOP custody, the Court can fairly\nreject many of the defendant’s complaints about her conditions of confinement. Simply put, the\ndefendant lies when it suits her. It apparently suits her to spread horror stories about her\nexperiences in jail to the press in an atempt to garner public sympathy.

She is trying the same tactic nou with the Court.\n\nThe defense’s atempts to compare the defendant’s conditions of confinement to that of a\ndefendant under Special <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Measures (“SAMs”) are stunningly off-base.

The Court explained that “Anton’s borrouing from his clients, while ethically\nquestionable, is . . . irrelevant to his truthfulness as an expert.” Jd. at l464.l\n\nThe same logic applies here. At most, Mr. JJ engaged in unethical (but not\nuntruthful) conduct that created the risk of harm by others. But none of that conduct involved\nlying or deceit, and none of it is relevant to his truthfulness.\n\nThere are other reasons this Court should preclude the government’s cross-examination.\nFirst, the Court should consider “whether the testimony of the witness in question is crucial or\nunimportant.” Nelson, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 39o. Here, Mr. J testimony relevant only\nto a narrou and limited issue—the admissibility of a document whose authenticity and relevance\nthe government appears not to question.\n\nSecond, the Court should consider “the relationship between the subject mater of the\nprior deceptive act and that of the instant litigation. As the connection becomes more atenuated,\nso does the probative value of the evidence.” Davidson Pipe Co. v. Laventhol & Horwath, l2o\nF.R.D. 455, 463 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Here, Mr. J conduct concerns yy\nMN. Phe subject mater of the instant litigation, by contrast, is alleged sexual abuse and\ntrafficking allegedly commited decades ago. There is no connection between “subject mater of\nthe prior [allegedly] deceptive act and that of the instant litigation.” See id.\n\nCases permiting cross-examination about an atorney’s disbarment or suspension are not\nto the contrary. E.g., United States v. Jackson, 882 F.2d l444, l448 (9th Cir. l989) (no error in\n\n' The Eleventh Circuit also held that the district court had erred in permiting inquiry into\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> proceedings against Anton where no probable cause was found, no\nsanction was imposed, or the proceedings were temporally remote.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> process outside of court.\n\n5.

Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l7 of l7\nThe Claimant is solely responsible to satisfy any and all other valid liens\n(other than Medicare and Medicaid liens referenced above) that have been\nasserted and/or may be asserted for reimbursement of any medical benefits\nprovided to the Claimant by a third party as a result of the injuries claimed.\n4.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9.

She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls.

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021182.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SAB 3536o38, Pagelo of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 348\nan investigation into the mater and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through the NPA.°®\n\nAfter the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 2l, 2ol9, OPR\nincluded within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that\nformed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford\nvictims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was\nsigned and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal\ninvestigation.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of\nthe Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys.\nThe records included emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials.

The leters were sent by an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media.

Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021490.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page6o of 2l7\nSA-3l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l4 of 348\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> staff, about the\nemail gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records\n\nOPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the\nVictim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein mater, to obtain relevant FBI documents.\nIn addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation\nconcerning its victim notification system.\n\n4.

In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter.

Michael Thomas would like this court to authorize the disclosure of any and all |\nreports generated by investigators within the Bureau of Prisons regarding the August lo, 2ol9\nincident, if those have not been disclosed. Additionally, the defendant seeks any all documents,\nreports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have\nengaged in the same or similar conduct. Mr. Thomas requests the results of any disciplinary\nproceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding the discipline or <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> ~\nadjudication of any other employees who have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts. More\nspecifically, the defense is aware that there was an almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6\nwherein officers failed to conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited\n\n. suicide. The defense believes that only one of four officers in that case was given only a minor\n(l4) day suspension.

One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a. l96\ncrime.\n\nStipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.jpg": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023310.jpg": "argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.‘\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.jpg": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023326.jpg": "Atorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates.

The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023375.jpg": "in an honest effort to perform official duties.\"° The ethical regulations also mandate that federal employees\nnot use federal property “for other than authorized activities.”\nBOP policy (Program Statement 342o.ll, Standards of Employee Conduct) imposes several additional\nstandards of conduct on its employees. At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nUnder federal law, “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3).

It is not required that the subject was aware of the\nexistence of Section lool.\nUnder BOP standards of conduct discussed above, employees are required to cooperate fully with official\ninvestigations, which includes providing “all pertinent information they may have” and “truthfully responding\nto questions.”\nc Relevant BOP Policies Regarding the Operation of Correctional Facilities\nl. Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023377.jpg": "Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates, and then remain in the unit until the Control\nCenter accepts the count.

If the\nsecond count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book\ncount, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center. A\nLieutenant must take at least l count in the morning and one in the evening.\nCorrectional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers,\nand retained for 3o days. Count slips may not be altered. BOP policy provides that the “official count will\nnot be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.”\n\nb. 3o-Minute Rounds\nThe BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention or\ndisciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU. In such cases, a correctional staff member must\nobserve all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 3o minutes (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.) and\nagain during the second 3o minutes (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.). BOP policy provides that these “rounds are\nto be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart.” These same requirements\nfor rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York's SHU.\n\nc. Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement\nBOP policy also provides that each institution must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates\nchanges to an inmate's status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each\ninmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate's confinement\nshould be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log\nof pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer\nsystem TRUSCOPE, which provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n\nd. Cell Searches\nBOP policy requires that BOP staff routinely and irregularly search housing units to, among other things,\nmaintain sanitary standards and eliminate safety hazards.’* The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require\nthat officers assigned to the SHU conduct searches of the SHU common areas and cells, and that the entire\nSHU be searched every week. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require writen\ndocumentation of each housing unit search.\n\n3. Psychological Screening\n\na.

BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb.

Each institution determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post\nOrders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove\nall limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023389.jpg": "obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney.

Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023445.jpg": "Figure 5.6 The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that in\nAugust 2ol9, each inmate would have been authorized to\nhave two sheets and one blanket.

Further, all\nhousing units have bulletin boards that have information\nexplaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions,\netc.\nThe Bureau’s <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Program is a process through\nwhich inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to\nvirtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures\nhave not resolved the mater. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 -\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy; and Program Statement l33o.l3,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Program. This program applies as follous:\n{l} to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of\nPrisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract\nResidential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally knoun as Community\nCorrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and\n(3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their\nconfinement. See C.F.R. §542.lo.\nInmates are obligated to atempt informal resolution of\ngrievances prior to filing a formal request for <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span>\nremedy. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l3. The deadline for completion of\ninformal resolution and submission of a formal writen\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 2o\ncalendar days follouing the date on which the basis for the\nRequest occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.l4. Once an inmate has\nfiled a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the\nWarden of that facility has 2o calendar days to investigate and\nprovide the inmate a writen response. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l8.\nIf the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden’s response, he/she\nhas 2o calendar days to file a Regional <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy\nAppeal (BP-lo). See 28 C.F.R. §542.l5. Once received in the\nRegional Office, the Regional Director has 3o calendar days toa\ninvestigate and provide the inmate a writen response. See 28\nC.F.LR. $542.l8. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional\nDirector’s response, he/she has 3o calendar days to file a\nCentral Office <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Appeal (BP-ll). See 28\nC.FLR,. $l5. Once received in the Central Office, the\nAdministrator, National Inmate Appeals, has 4o days to\ninvestigate and provide the inmate a writen response. 28 C.F.R.\n$542.l8. After receiving the Administrator’s response, the\ninmate has exhausted the Bureau's <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Program.\nThe program provides for expedited investigations and responses\nin emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both\nfiling grievances and receiving responses. At any level, an\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy may be rejected if it does not fully comply\nwith Program Statement l33o.l3, <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Program.\n\nPage l7? of 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2376o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023761.jpg": "If complaining about a sensitive issue, in the sense that the\ninmate’s safety or well-heing would be placed in danger if the\nrequest became knoun at the institution, the inmate may submit\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> remedy directly to the appropriate Regional\nDirector, marking “Sensitive” upon the request and explaining, in\nwriting, the reason for net submiting the request at the\ninstitution. See Program Statement l33o.l3, Sec.8{d) (l),\n<span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy Program. If the Regional <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span>\nRemedy Coordinator agrees that the request is sensitive, the\nrequest shall be accepted, investigated, and responded to.\nOtherwise, the request will not be accepted, and the inmate will\nbe advised in writing of that determination, without return of\nthe request. The inmate may then pursue the mater by submiting\na request for <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Remedy locally to the Warden. The\nWarden shall allou a reasonable extension of time for such a\nresubmission. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l7.\nSpecial procedures regarding the appeal of Disciplinary Hearing\nOfficer (DHO) actions may be found at 28 C.F.R. §542.l4(d) (2).\nAppeals from DHG actions shall be submited initially to the\nRegional Director for the region where the inmate is currently\nlocated.\nG. Inmate Designations\nThe majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates\nwho, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another\ninstitution. Houever, an inmate is not transported to a new\ninstitution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement and commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve 4a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete. Contact information for DSCC is\nas follous:\nDesignation and Sentence Computation Center\nGrand Prairie Office Complex\nU.S. Armed Forces Reserve Complex\n346 Marine Forces Drive\nGrand Prairie, TX 75o5l\nPhone: 972-352-44oo\nPax: 972-352-4395\n\nPage l8 of 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2376l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023763.jpg": "This can be accomplished by placing the empty botle on the daily\npill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least\nonce a day. If medical staff feel that an inmate should not he\nin possession of certain medications they need (certain\npsychiatric medications), the inmate will be administered the\nmedication by pharmacy during daily pill line.\n4. Independent Medical Examinations (IME)\nIf an atorney seeks a court order for an IME, the follouing\ninformation must be included:\n{l) Inmate’s name and register number;\n(2) A court order or similar court signea document for the\nexamination;\n(3) A provision for time and date to be determined by all\naffected parties;\n(4) Expected length of examination;\n{5) Name, title, and organization of each person atending\n(all-non atorneys and non-legal representatives will\nhave to fill out an application so MCC can complete a\nbackground check (See Atachment B);\n(6) List of all equipment to be used; and\n(7) An indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been\nobtained.\nAll of the above should be faxed to the Legal Department who will\nmake arrangements with the medical department for a convenient\ntime and date. The physician entering will be subject to using\nthe equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also\nhave to complete Atachment B.\n2 Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital\nAll USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will\nbe referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.\nI. Special Housing Unit (SHU)\nMCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general\npopulation. The SHU consists of two categories of cells:\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention and disciplinary segregation.\nDisciplinary Segregation Status. A form of separation from the\ngeneral population in which inmates who commit serious violations\nof Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nfor specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general\npopulation. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary\nsegregation upon determining that no other available disposition\nwill adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence\nnecessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable\nlimits.\nPage 2o of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023764.jpg": "<span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> Detention Status. A non-punitive form of\nseparation from the general population used when the continued\npresence of the inmate within the general population would pose a\nserious threat to life, property, self, staff or other inmates,\nor to the security or orderly running of the institution. This\nhousing status may also include inmates who require protective\ncustody, those who cannot be placed in local population because\nthey are en route to another institution (holdovers), and those\nwho are awaiting a hearing before the Unit Discipline Commitee\nor Discipline Hearing Officer. Program Statement 527o.o7, Inmate\nDiscipline and Special Housing Units, found at Bureau’s public\nwebsite.\nAdditionally, all newly arriving inmates at MCC are placed in the\nSpecial Housing Unit until they are screened and an appropriate\nhousing unit (general population or SHU) is determined.\nJ. Miscellaneous\n\nl. Religious Programs\nTitle 28 C.F.R. §548, Religious Programs and Program Statement\n536o.o9, Religious Beliefs and Practices set forth the Bureau of\nPrisons’ policy for inmates who wish to practice their religion\nwhile incarcerated. Chaplains are available at all institutions.\nSee 28 C.F.R. §548.l2. In addition, contract religious clergy\nand volunteers from the community augment Bureau staff to make\navailable a wide variety of programs, including those involving\ngroup worship, individual religions counseling, spiritual\nguidance, and the study of sacred writings. See 28 C.F.R.\n$548.l4. Inmates must make all religious requests, including\ncommon fare diets, through the Religious Services Department.\n\nPh, Food Service\nTitle 28 C.F.R. §548, Subpart C - Special Food and Meals,\nprovides that special diets are available to meet the medical\nneeds of diabetics and others who require lou-salt, lou-calorie,\nor other special diets. Additionally, “common-fare” meals are\noffered to inmates whose religious practices require dietary\nrestrictions. See 28 C.F.R. §§547.2o(b) and 548.2o; Program\nStatement 536o.o9, Religious Beliefs and Practices. The common\nfare program is designed to meet the dietary requirements of\ndifferent religions.\n\nSs Inmate Commissary\nInmates’ families and friends may send inmates funds through\nWestern Union’s Quick Collect Program or through the National\nLock Box.

Personal hygiene items\nare issued by the institution for indigent inmates. Inmates may\nalso purchase personal property items from the institution\ncommissary.\nInmates going out to court may bring legal material relevant to\ntheir current court proceedings. Inmates are not alloued toa\nreturn from court with additional legal materials.

Inmate Epstein has various risk\nfactors for suicidality including a high profile case with media atention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court\nproceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate\nEpstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology\ndepartment. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist\nand to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment.\nCompleted by |PhDIChief Psychologist on o7/o8/2ol9 lo:49\nGenerated o7/o8/2ol9 lo:49 by PI) PhD /Chiet Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page l of l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ol5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025115.jpg": "Page 753\nPsychology verbally notifies the Operations Lieutenant when inmates are removed from suicide watch and that they\nwill need to be placed with a cellmate. Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from\nsuicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population seting. The C&A officer is responsible for\nentering the proper assignment.\nOnce an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and\nLieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.\nThe e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with. This recommendation for\na cellmate and conversation with the Lieutenant is also documented in the Post Suicide Watch Report and placed in\nBEMR/PDS.\nPsychology Services has eliminated the use of Psychological Observation to avoid any confusion as to the needs of\ninmates on a watch status.\n2. Rounds: 3o-minute rounds are required by P55oo.l4, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.\nInstitution Response: 2. Rounds:\nSHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within\nthe policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a\ndaily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets\nwill be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds. A staff member must\nobserve all inmates confined in continuous locked doun status, such as <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention or disciplinary\nsegregation, at least once in the first 3o minute period of the hour, folloued by another round in the second 3o\nminute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be\nconducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart. All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take\nmore security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate. Two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video\nreview are being conducted.\n\n3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2ol9\" —\nIn an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement\nrepeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk\nfactors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2ol9,\nere kent an e-mail to Shirley Skipper-Scot, Associate Warden explaining a consultation between © o7 __ |\nNational Suicide Prevention Coordinator. In the e-mail, [°° __]Reviewed the consult and\nrecommendation from the Psychology Services Branch, Central Office that Mr. Epstein be housed with another\ninmate who had also been accused of commiting a sex offense.

The undersigned counsel went out\nof his way to make certain Mr. Epstein would not be in the building after the time the deposition\nwas sef to begin. Had the Plaintiff and her counsel been in the deposition room at the appointed\ntime, no visual contact would have occurred. )\nl5.

The unilateral termination of the deposition was unnecessary, inappropriate and a\n. substantial waste of atomey time and the costs related to the deposition (court reporter and.\n. videographer). (See Affidavit of Robert D. Criton, Jr., Mark T. Lutier and Deposition |\nTranscript, Exhibits 6, 7, and 8 respectively). :\n#7. Had the “visual” been premeditated, the cancellation of the deposition may have .\nbeen justified, houever, under these circumstances, it was grandstanding and improper. In that |\nthe Plaintiff has stated that she voluntary went to JE’s home 5o plus times without trauma until |\nshe filed a lawsuit, this brief visual encounter from a distance should not have resulted in the |\nunilateral cancellation of her deposition. :\nl8.

The consistent practice of USAQs to limit the scope\nof plea agreements stands in stark contrast to the\nscope of the NPA here.\n\nThe trial court correctly noted that “[nJationwide,\nunlimited agreements are the rare exception.” (App.\nat 56a). The fact that this NPA is a “rare exception”\nto Department’s general practice does not void the\nagreement’s broad reach. In fact, the rarity of nationwide\nagreements is a persuasive reason to enforce it because\nthere can be no question that the choice of language was\nintentional and a key part of the parties’ bargain.\n\nThis situation is no different than a contractual\nprovision that binds a corporate subsidiary and, by\nextension, the parent corporation. Unless the subsidiary\nplainly lacked authority to enter into the agreement, that\nprovision is enforceable against the parent. Similarly, one\nUSAO has the authority to bind the entire Department.\n“(T]he prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the\nspokesman for the Government. A promise made by one\natorney must be atributed, for these purposes, to the\nGovernment.” Giglio v.

One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request.

Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\n34 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a l96\ncrime,\n\nStipulated <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.tif": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v.

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nWW. THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””67 On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?®\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2323o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023296.tif": "In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023310.tif": "argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.tif": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.tif": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023326.tif": "Atorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knouledge of the problem, or that they or,\nto their knouledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at\nOPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.\nAtorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence\nindicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of\nconcealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the\nresult of a technological error.\n\nAlthough a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2oo7, through April 2, 2oo8,\nremained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this\ntime due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,\nwhich did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and\nwitnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.\n\n3.

Methodology\nDuring the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one\noccasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023377.tif": "Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates, and then remain in the unit until the Control\nCenter accepts the count. If a count reported verbally does not match the master count, then the Control\nCenter must notify the Operations Lieutenant and the staff members must recount the inmates. If the\nsecond count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book\ncount, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center. A\nLieutenant must take at least l count in the morning and one in the evening.\nCorrectional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers,\nand retained for 3o days. Count slips may not be altered. BOP policy provides that the “official count will\nnot be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.”\n\nb. 3o-Minute Rounds\nThe BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention or\ndisciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU. In such cases, a correctional staff member must\nobserve all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 3o minutes (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.) and\nagain during the second 3o minutes (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.). BOP policy provides that these “rounds are\nto be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart.” These same requirements\nfor rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York's SHU.\n\nc. Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement\nBOP policy also provides that each institution must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates\nchanges to an inmate's status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each\ninmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate's confinement\nshould be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log\nof pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer\nsystem TRUSCOPE, which provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n\nd. Cell Searches\nBOP policy requires that BOP staff routinely and irregularly search housing units to, among other things,\nmaintain sanitary standards and eliminate safety hazards.’* The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require\nthat officers assigned to the SHU conduct searches of the SHU common areas and cells, and that the entire\nSHU be searched every week. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require writen\ndocumentation of each housing unit search.\n\n3. Psychological Screening\n\na.

Telephone Calls\nThe federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54o.loo-54o.lo6, that govern telephone calls for inmates require that\nthe Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate telephone conversations, which\nis “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution and to protect the public.” For\nsafety and security reasons, BOP policy (Program Statement P5264.o8, Inmate Telephone Regulations)\nrequires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System. BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb. Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens\nFederal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention status ordinarily\nmay have a reasonable amount of personal property.'° Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal\nproperty of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”\"®\nThe BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU. Restricted medications\nare administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each institution determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post\nOrders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove\nall limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed. These\nPost Orders further specify that all cells are to be cleaned daily by inmates occupying the cell, and that\nblankets, touels, and other linens will not be used as rugs or hung over inmate bunk beds at any time.\nPursuant to these Post Orders, MCC New York housing unit officers on all three shifts are responsible for\nmaintaining “a high level of sanitation” and a “safe and clean environment.”\n5 28 C.F.R. § 54l.3l (h)(l).\nl6 BOP Program Statement 527o.ll, Special Housing Units.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2338o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023389.tif": "obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nI. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on <span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. <span class=\"highlight\">Administrative</span> segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

MCC New York Psychology Department personnel told the OIG\nthat MCC New York staff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement because it was discussed during\nstaff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and during required\nstaff training.\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l said she explained to the\natorney that Epstein needed to have a cellmate because he was housed in the SHU and he was a\nsex offender.\nVI. Selection of Epstein’s Cellmate After Psychological Observation\nThe Captain told the OIG that he compiled a list of possible cellmates for Epstein, veted those inmates, and\nprovided the list of names to the MCC New York Warden. The Warden told the OIG that he identified two\npotential cellmates and tentatively decided on Inmate 3. The Warden said he passed this information on to\nthe BOP Director's Chief of Staff and later received word that he should assign Inmate 3 to be\nEpstein’s cellmate.\nThe Warden told the OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to replace Inmate 3 if he left MCC New York. The\nWarden and the Captain told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been removed as Epstein’s cellmate, they would\nhave had to review a new list of potential cell mate candidates to ensure that Epstein was housed with an\nappropriate inmate. According to the Warden and the Captain, if Inmate 3 was no longer detained at MCC\nNew York, SHU staff should have informed a Lieutenant on duty, who should have informed the Captain,\nwho would have ensured that the process of selecting a new cellmate for Epstein would begin.\nVil. Epstein’s Cell Assignment from July 3o to August lo\nAs a result of Epstein’s cellmate requirement, on July 3o, 2ol9, follouing his release from psychological\nobservation, Epstein was initially assigned to cell Zo4-2o6 with Inmate 3 in the J Tier of the SHU.2° A BOP\n26 SENTRY, which is BOP’s database of information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline,\nand programs of inmates, inaccurately reflected that this move from his psychological observation cell to the SHU\noccurred the previous day (July 29, 2ol9).

The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied\nsuicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding\nadditional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The\nChief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follou-up and that Epstein\nwould be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.\nAccording to the BOP After Action Review submited by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief\nPsychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request during his atorney conference was\ninappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that\nthe intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.\nOn July l8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was\nunavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would atempt to interview Epstein in the near\nfuture to complete his monthly review.\nAs noted previously, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his\ncell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general\n<span class=\"highlight\">administrative</span> note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023743.tif": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nl.

A form of separation from the\ngeneral population in which inmates who commit serious violations\nof Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nfor specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general\npopulation. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary\nsegregation upon determining that no other available disposition\nwill adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence\nnecessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable\nlimits.\nPage 2o of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023765.tif": "4, Marriage\nInmates whe seek authorization to marry while in confinement must\nsubmit a writen request through their Case Manager.\n\n5, Personal Property\nBureau of Prisons policy on inmate retention of personal property\nis found in Program Statement 558o.o7, Personal Property, Inmate.\nSee also 28 C.F.R. Part 553 - Inmate Property. Inmates may\npossess only that property which by policy is authorized. See 28\nC.F.LR. $553.ll. Those rules contribute to the management of\ninmate personal property in the institution, and contribute to a\nsafe environment for staff and inmates by reducing fire hazards,\nsecurity risk, and sanitation problems. Personal hygiene items\nare issued by the institution for indigent inmates. Inmates may\nalso purchase personal property items from the institution\ncommissary.\nInmates going out to court may bring legal material relevant to\ntheir current court proceedings. Inmates are nat alloued toa\nreturn from court with additional legal materials. Atorneys\nwishing to provide Inmates with additional legal materials must\nsend such material in the mail or deposit them material in the\nlobby legal mail drop boxes.\n\n6. A&G Handbook\nInmates entering MCC New York are provided with an Admission and\nOrientation (“A&O”) Handbook, which explains institution rules\nand procedures.

The undersigned counsel went out\nof his way to make certain Mr. Epstein would not be in the building after the time the deposition\nwas sef to begin. Had the Plaintiff and her counsel been in the deposition room at the appointed\ntime, no visual contact would have occurred. )\nl5. It is possible that Plaintiff’s counsel, by filing their motion for protective order on\nSeptember 9, 2oo9 and then advising the undersigned on September l4, 2oo9 that the deposition\n- would not go forward unless the undersigned agreed to exclude Mr. Epstein from the deposition, |\nwere not prepared and/or did not want to proceed with the deposition. |\nl6.
