When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates.

The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\n<span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>. Hunger and poor <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span> inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l59 Filed o2/l6/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to once again ask the Court to release Ghislaine Maxwell prior to trial on the\nconditions set forth in her previous bail applications. My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating circumstances that I have ever experienced in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice. As disturbing and invasive as they are for no\njustifiable reason, I get to leave; Ms. Maxwell does not. The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr.\nHannibal Lecter’s incarceration as portrayed in the movie, “Silence of the Lambs,” despite the\nabsence of the cage and plastic face guard. Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention for the past\nl6 months continue to be reprehensible and uterly inappropriate for woman on the cusp of\nturning 6o with no criminal record or history of violence. It is unwarranted, unrelenting, and\nuterly inappropriate.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the correction officers,\npoor and unsanitary living conditions, insufficient <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>, difficulties reviewing the millions of\nlegal discovery documents in the case against her, and sleep deprivation. She has been\nconsistently housed in segregation from all other inmates, with rotating teams of multiple\ncorrections officers per daily shift which rotate on a bi-weekly basis. Many of the officers are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006059.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page4of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nthe effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, “sleep deprivation result[s] in a loss of\ncognitive flexibility through feedback...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with\ndynamic atentional control.” 4\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense have been gradually eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement and are further exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation. The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

In other cases that I have had in this court house\nl8 either the clients come from the MCC, which is no longer here\nl9 and they're transported one way, or when I come here in the\n2o morning for a court proceeding or trial, and I will get here at\n2l 9:oo, I'm told they haven't arrived yet.

Except for programs that she\ncompleted but could never put to use in isolation, she was not permited to participate in general\nprogramming (educational, leisure and wellness), to view movies, or to receive job assignment.\nWhen she first arrived in the MDC, she was handcuffed while seated in a chair watching television.\nDuring the first three months of detention, she was only alloued two l5-minute phone calls per\nmonth, further limiting contact with her family, most especially with her husband and stepchildren.\nThis is the same restriction that was applied in MCC’s lo South, the super-secure\nspecial/segregated housing unit (“SHU”) for inmates charged with terrorism offenses. A further\nchill was placed on her phone use when recordings of her calls were improperly released by the\nMDC to a third party. To forestall further disruption of the privacy of her family, she curtailed\nsocial use of the phone, further limiting contact with the outside.\n\nMs. Maxwell was denied adequate <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>. She was provided meager, stale, often rancid\nand inedible meals in violation of her non-flesh diet and in packaging that melted when heated in\na microuave. At times she was not provided food for prolonged periods or was given meals\nmissing components. She was denied access to basic hygiene items, e.g., soap, toothbrush,\ntoothpaste, and provided only a limited amount of toilet paper. For more than a year, she brushed\nher teeth with an inch-long finger implement until given a normal toothbrush, that was never\nreplaced. Her commissary list was restricted, and she was not permited to order items available\nto other inmates.'> When the tap water in her isolation cell was foul-smelling and undrinkable,\nrequests for botled water were initially rejected by the prison administration. As a result of being\nprovided an inadequate diet, Ms. Maxwell has lost about 2o pounds and suffered from telogen\n'S Even in general population, her commissary is more restricted than other inmates. A unit officer\nconfirmed that commissary operates on favoritism and discrimination.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 26 of 77\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>). Complaints made during trial regarding her\ninadequate daily <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span> were received as a nuisance rather than cause for concern and atention.\n\nAn extra blanket provided because of the cold temperature in her cell was removed on the\nclaim it had not been approved by the warden, only to be returned when guards observed Ms.\nMaxwell shaking while asleep and became concerned that she might be having a seizure. She was\ngiven limited time to exercise in an area without sunlight or fresh air, then constructively denied\nthe ability to exercise because she was not provided proper-fiting footwear.\n\nThe treatment imposed on Ms. Maxwell was unnecessarily and intentionally degrading and\nthreatening. While in isolation, a high-ranking prison guard told Ms. Maxwell that there was\nconcern that she would be shot by sniper. Puting aside the reason and propriety of dispensing this\nalarming information, the diminution of security concerns resulting in her transfer to general\npopulation appears correlated to Ms. Maxwell having been sufficiently safeguarded to fill\nEpstein’s empty seat — satisfying the concerns of the government, DOJ, BOP, MDC, prosecutors,\nCourt, and accusers.\n\nDeprived of sleep and adequate <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span> and subjected to such undignified and\ndehumanizing conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell was considerably weakened psychologically\nand had great difficulty concentrating, thwarting her ability to participate in and prepare her\ndefense. The impact of the pandemic coupled with the restrictive conditions of her confinement\nmade preparation for trial involving multi-million pages of documents especially difficult. Despite\nbeing given a laptop, she encountered persistent technical issues reviewing electronic discovery,\nat times unreadable on both the laptop and prison PC, and could not search, highlight, annotate,\nsave, or print. Further, delivery of her mail (legal and non-legal) was significantly delayed as were\nreceipt of CorrLinks emails, which were prematurely deleted by the MDC.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020206.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8; Co68OosAeIN 3D6cOrherit459l , Bled 52ol G/ahe Paget 2 ob 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nAs the government states, a flashlight is pointed at the ceiling of her isolation cell every\nl5 minutes, from approximately 9:3o pm to 6:3o am. It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span> and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020443.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page5/7 of 9l\nsee Dkt.

Nathan on ll/9/2o2l) (Inl) (Entered: ll/o9/2o2l)\n\nll/o9/2o2l 426 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion for\nreconsideration regarding release on bond, Dkt. No. 4o8, and the parties' leters regarding\nthe delivery of the Defendant's legal mail and transport to the courthouse for pretrial\nconferences and trial in this case, Dkt. Nos. 38l, 4o3, 422. For the reasons stated in this\nCourt's prior bail determinations, Dkt. Nos. 93, lo6, l69, and the Government's leter in\nopposition, Dkt. No. 423, the renewed request for bail is denied. Moreover, based on the\nrepresentations from MDC legal counsel regarding the delivery of the Defendant's legal\nmail, Dkt. No. 422, the Court concludes that the Defendant has adequate access to legal\ncounsel and legal mail in order to prepare for trial. MDC legal counsel and the\nGovernment are ordered to take the steps outlined in the Dkt. No. 422 between nou and\nthe completion of trial. As to the Defendant's transport, the Court concludes that she will\nbe transported to and from the courthouse for pretrial conferences and trial in a way that\nis humane, proper, and consistent with security protocols. This conclusion is based on\nrepresentations from MDC legal counsel in the leter submited under seal because it\ndiscusses BOP security protocols, see Dkt. No. 4l2, as well as the Court's communication\nwith the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York. The Government,\nBOP, and USMS shall continue to take all available measures consistent with security\nprotocols to ensure the Defendant has sufficient rest, <span class=\"highlight\">nutrition</span>, and comfort in order to be\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 63/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024094.jpg": "Bureau of Prisons\nHealth Services\nClinical Encounter\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/3o/2ol9 l5:58 Provider: po a Unit: Zol\nChronic Care - Chronic Care Clinic encounter performed at Health Services.\nSUBJECTIVE:\nCOMPLAINT l Provider: POO “o\nChief Complaint: Other Problem\nSubjective: PATIENT WAS REFERRED BY THE WARDEN FOR EVALUATION.\nPATIENT REPORTS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT HIS MEDS FOR ABOUT l WEEK.
