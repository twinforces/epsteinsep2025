Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original).

Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'!

It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAnnie Farmer submits the follouing statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed\n\nmotion for bail.\nis 2K 3\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this mater and once more\nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001389.jpg": "Castat2olcr-oo3BoAuNEnNDoCuate hd 2o2 l FRGACLBS5Ragehagd 3Of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The recently filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that\nagreement and adds two new charges which vastly expand the relevant time period from a four-\nyear period in the l99os to an eleven-year period stretching from l994 to 2oo4. These additions\nsignificantly alter the scope of the government’s case and necessarily shift the focus of the\ndefense’s trial preparation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of\nthe three accusers from the l99os, as we have been doing, the defense will nou have to spend\nconsiderable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely\ndifferent time period involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that\nCOVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation.\n\nWe do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance.

In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 4\ninvestigation. The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v. Teman, No. l9-CR-696\n(PAE), 2o2o WL 3o34o34, at *43 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2o2o) (citations omited), see also, Bagley\nv. Lumpkin, 798 F.2d l297, l3ol (9th Cir. l986); United States v. Librach, 52o F.2d 55o, 554\n(8th Cir. l975).\n\nThe Government is the Team\n\nIn an atempt to minimize what it promised, the Government redefines who it believes is\non the Team. The Government claims no <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record\nassurances that it gave the Court on July l4, 2o2o:\n\n“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior investigative files\n\nfrom another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. l2:lo-l3\n\n“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at\n\nthe New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned and photographed to\n\nmake sure that a comprehensive review can be conducted, and they are physically in New\n\nYork so that we can have access to those files.” Jd., l4:lo-l4\n\nNou, the Government seeks to distance itself from its oun files, which are in New York,\nnot Florida, by arguing that they are excused from reviewing or producing information because it\n6 Pursuant to this Court’s practice standards regarding discovery, Ms. Maxwell, on October l3, 2o2o, sent a detailed\nleter requesting the production of discovery materials under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972). The Government has yet\nto respond.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 3 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far.

She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l4\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nTW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo254l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 38\ndefendant); it is about whether the government, in bringing charges, has met the governing legal\nstandards. It has not done so here, and the indictment must be dismissed.\n\na\n\nThis memorandum focuses on the NPA. As this memorandum demonstrates, Ms.\nMaxwell’s indictment violates the clear and unqualified terms of the NPA and should therefore\nbe dismissed. The NPA was heavily negotiated over approximately eight months and involved\nnot only Epstein and the SDFL but also senior levels of Main Justice in Washington, D.C., which\napproved the NPA before its execution. Given the blistering public criticism of the NPA and of\nAcosta’s handling of the Epstein investigation, it is understandable that the current regime may\nwish the government had not entered into the NPA, or that it had negotiated different terms.\nIndeed, the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> (“OPR”) found that\nAcosta exercised “poor judgment” and “agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the\nNPA,” which OPR characterized as a “unique resolution.”\n\nBut the government is bound by the agreement it negotiated and executed. And the NPA\nis clear, explicit, and unambiguous. The government cannot nou ask this Court to rewrite the\nagreement in a way more favorable to its current position, nor overlook key distinctions in the\nagreement, by claiming that they were drafting mistakes or omissions. Nor may the government\nask this Court to construe ambiguities in its favor, in contravention of black-leter law that non-\nprosecution agreements must be construed strictly against the government.\n\nThe government, in prior submissions, has raised three arguments why the NPA does not\napply here, none of which has merit:\n\nFirst, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA\nbecause she is not a party to it and is not named in it. The government ignores that the parties to\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 38\nthe NPA’s language and structure, as well as the manner in which it was negotiated, were highly\natypical. The result was a one-off agreement that deviated in several material respects from, and\nbore litle resemblance to, a standard agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s OPR, after investigating Acosta’s handling of the Epstein\ncase, characterized the NPA as a “unique resolution.” Exh.

In particular, the OPR concluded that Acosta “agreed to\nseveral unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the consideration required under the\ncircumstances.” Jd. While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms\nto which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.\n\nA. The Structure of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”).

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2629\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l4\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\nL In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\nE OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2635\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l4\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n” 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nlX\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 23\nthe government further advised that, to the extent it had access to an unredacted copy of the\nreport, it would produce it when it produces Gig/io material.\n\nThe defense believes that these reports contain Brady material and should be produced\nimmediately, a\nee\nee\neee\nee\nee\nee\n\nIt is the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to obtain unredacted copies of these reports and\nproduce them to the defense. The government cannot absolve itself of its Brady obligations by\nproducing redacted documents “as is,” when they could easily obtain unredacted copies from the\nFBI. See Kyles v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 437 (l995) (the government “has a duty to learn of any\nfavorable evidence knoun to the others acting on the government’s behalf in the case, including\nthe police”). An informed witness who fails to mention the defendant when making a police\nreport is certainly exculpatory under Brady. United States v. Torres, 7l9 F.2d 549, 555-56 (2d\nCir. l983); Jones v. Jago, 575 F.2d ll64, ll68 (6th Cir. l978); Clemmons v. Delo, l24 F.3d\n944, 952 (8\"\" Cir. l997); White v. Helling, l94 F.3d 937, 944 (8 Cir. l999).\n\nThe timing for Brady disclosures is nou. As this Court ruled:\n\n“The Government must disclose to the defense all information ‘favorable\n\nto an accused’ that is “material either to guilt or to punishment’ and that is\n\nknoun to the Government. . . . The Government shall disclose such\n\ninformation to the defense promptly after its existence becomes knoun to\n\nthe Government so that the defense may make effective use of the\n\ninformation in the preparation of its case.”\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002925.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page l of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

As the Government has noted for some time nou, the\nGovernment intends to match or even go above and beyond that practice in this case. Specifically,\nthe Government has offered repeatedly to provide non-testifying witness statements to the defense\nas much as eight weeks before trial, thereby allouing extra time for the defense to determine\nwhether it wishes to call any of the witnesses the Government does not intend to present at trial,\nand to provide testifying witness statements and Giglio material as much as four weeks in advance\nof trial. Given that the defense has already been able to initiate its investigation of the charges,\nand given that the discovery makes clear who the three minor victims are, eight weeks should be\nample time to review non-testifying witness statements, and four weeks is more than enough time\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l of 348\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nOFFICE OF\nPROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span>\nREPORT\nInvestigation into the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s\nResolution of Its 2oo6—2oo8 Federal Criminal Investigation of\nJeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation\nNovember 2o2o\nNOTE: THIS REPORT CONTAINS SENSITIVE, PRIVILEGED, AND PRIVACY\nACT PROTECTED INFORMATION.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9 of 348\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 348\nIl. .OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA wee eeeeeeee l34\nA.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO.

OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury. Menchel told OPR that he understood that the State\n38\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control”*® in licu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp://www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ceforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo329o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®® Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 348\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of restitution, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others. USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for his/her conduct;\n5. The desirability of prompt and certain disposition of\nthe case;\n6. The likelihood of obtaining a conviction at trial;\nre The probable effect on witnesses;\n8. The probable sentence or other consequences if the\ndefendant is convicted;\n9, The public interest in having the case tried rather\nthan disposed of by a guilty plea;\nlo. The expense of trial and appeal;\nll. The need to avoid delay in the disposition of other\npending cases; and\nl2. The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution.\n4. USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003333.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.” In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.” Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”**’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nee.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 348\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also recetved a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 249 of 348\niets U.S. Department of Justice\nfare Federal Bureau of Investigation\nmeet in: FBI - West Palm Beach\nAA Se e Sulte 6oo.\n‘eee 5o6 South Flagler Drive\nais .

In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”*\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned. n late Janua , as Villafafia and the ria orney prepared to participate\n\ngned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villaf: d the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participat\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.*! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o3 of 348\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm |isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”*? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.*“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 323 of 348\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n/\nNON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter “Epstein’”) is reported to have\ncommited offenses against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around\nOctober 2oo5, including:\n\n(l) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to commit\nan offense against the United States, that is, to use a facility or means of interstate\nor foreign commerce to knouingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to\nengage in prostitution, in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section\n2422(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section 37l;\n\n(2) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to travel in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females, in violation of Title l8,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States\nCode, Section 2423(e);\n\n(3) using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knouingly\npersuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Sections 2422(b) and 2;\n\n(4) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual\nconduct, as defined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, enticing,\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had not atained\nthe age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for his behavior by his\n\nIlaye l od 4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34l of 348\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.\n\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\nfollous:\n7A.

Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution\n\nIn September 2oo7, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey\nEpstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the Office of the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to\nplead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. /d. In exchange, the U.S. Atorney’s Office agreed not to charge him\nwith federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his\nconduct between 2ool and 2oo7. /d. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of\nhis “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\nobserved, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.\nOPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S. Atorney’s\npromise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added “with litle\ndiscussion or consideration by the prosecutors.” Jd. at l69, l85. The report concluded that the\nU.S. Atorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,\nbut nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” Jd. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell\ncontends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of\nJeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal\nlimitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New\nYork. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the Sl superseding indictment.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3677\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury conviction. The courts holding is equally applicable here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352 (l973), makes clear that an individual cannot be\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo372l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 8of23\n\nMs. Maxwell thus need not shou that the parties to the NPA were thinking of her “in\nparticular’; rather, it is sufficient that she falls within the class of individuals the parties to the\nNPA intended to benefit. See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\nidentified as potential co-conspirators. In reviewing the negotiating history of the parties over\nthis provision, the OPR Report notes that the government had not specifically contemplated other\npotential co-conspirators, yet it also demonstrates that the Epstein defense lawyers consistently\n* The OPR Report, of which only the executive summary had been released previously, has been submited as\nExhibit 3 to the government’s opposition.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel4of23\nalternative explanation for this difference in terminology, reasonable or otherwise—presumably\nbecause it cannot.\n\nThus, a drafting prosecutor who intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL clearly knew hou to do so, using either of two methods employed elsewhere in the\ndocument. The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that “the United States . . .\nwill not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of\nEpstein.” It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDEL, as it did\nelsewhere in the NPA, and provided that “the United States Atorney’s Office . .. will not\ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Again, it did\nnot. It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting\ntools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent.\n\nThe government’s inability to provide a reasonable alternative explanation for its use of\ndifferent language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from\nthe co-conspirator immunity provision. But to the extent there remains any doubt, plea\nagreements must be construed “strictly against the government,” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89\n(internal citations omited), and the government is held “responsible for imprecisions or\nambiguities in the agreement.” United States v. Padilla, l86 F.3d l36, l42 (2d Cir. l999).\nWhile the government argues that Annabi relieves it of this <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> where the\n“imprecisions or ambiguities” relate to the geographic applicability of a plea agreement (Opp. 6\nn.2), it cites no authority for this proposition.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 349\nIl. .OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA uo. eeeeeeeeee l34\nA.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control’”*® in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll5 of 349\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004455.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l58 of 349\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6l of 349\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.*°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nWI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l62 of 349\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l75 of 349\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n“|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8l of 349\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.””°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “chung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.*?’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\nal Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9o of 349\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l99 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “‘back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.7**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\nad Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4496\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 224 of 349\neaten, U.S. Department of Fustice\ngrate Federal Burcau of Investigation\nay FBI - West Palm Beach\nree cey Suite 5oo\noa 3o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) 833-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 278, 2oo6\nRe: Case Number: a\na\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Programas being a possible victim of a federal ‘\ncrime.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004534.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 237 of 349\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25o of 349\nmeet U.S. Department of Justice\nFP gaES NN Federal Bureau of Investigation\ndar SUT»: FB| - West Palm Beach\nRON gee e Sulte 5oo.\nneti 5o6 South Flagler Drive\nae .

The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3oo of 349\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.*°° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ol of 349\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o4 of 349\natend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”* The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tm lisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\naB7 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n488 See R.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 324 of 349\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n/\nNON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter “Epstein”) is reported to have\ncommited offenses against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around\nOctober 2oo5, including:\n\n(l) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to commit\nan offense against the United States, that ls, to use a facility or means of interstate\nor foreign commerce to knouingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to\nengage in prostitution, in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section\n2422(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section 37l;\n\nQ) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to travel in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females, in violation of Title l8,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States\nCode, Section 2423(e);\n\n(3) using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knouingly\npersuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Sections 2422(b) and 2;\n\n(4) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual\nconduct, as defined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, enticing,\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had not atamned\nthe age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for his behavior by his\n\nIlaye l od 4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo462l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 342 of 349\n\nIN RE:\n\nINVESTIGATION OF\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\n\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\n\nfollous:\n\n7A.

As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\nirrelevant decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\ncircumstances”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\ncircumstances of its creation. As the Court is aware, those circumstances were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo542l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 54\nDep’t of Justice, Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Report, Dkt. No 293 Ex. A). Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\nenforcement agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an extensive sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 69\n\nAccordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented\nto the jury. It will not be confusing or distracting to elicit evidence of hou that investigation\nconcluded, as the government contends. See Mot. at 27. In fact, the opposite is true. Without\nthat evidence, the jury will be left to speculate hou and when the Florida Investigation ended,\nand whether Ms. Maxwell was charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,\neliciting evidence of hou the Florida Investigation ended, including who was (and was not)\ncharged in the proposed indictment, and who was (and was not) immunized in the NPA, will be\nnecessary to avoid jury confusion and speculation, as well as prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government also suggests that introducing the NPA would require an extended “trial\nwithin a trial” concerning the history of its creation, which was the subject of the 29o-page report\nfrom the Department of Justice Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> (the “OPR Report”). Mot.\nat 27-28. Not so. The defense has no interest in probing the minutiae of the circumstances\nsurrounding the creation of the NPA. It seems even less likely that the government would do so,\ngiven that the OPR Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of hou\nthe U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution\nof the investigation. OPR Report at 284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by puting the\nNPA at issue in the trial is therefore illusory. It should not be excluded under Rule 4o3.7°\n° The NPA is also not hearsay. It is an agreement that has independent legal significance and is a “verbal\nact” “containing legally operative language affecting the rights of the parties” that does not qualify as\nhearsay.

That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse.

The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 52\nl29-l, 2ol2 WL l565o99 (E.D.

Offering this opinion in this form can\nonly serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category,\nare more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz\nacknouledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a “‘case-by-case basis” (Ex. A at ll),\nthat case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and\nstereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that “significant proportions” of victims exhibit post-traumatic\nstress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are\n“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a\nsexual assault event.” (Ex.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 54\n\nSecond, even if the decision of whether to charge the defendant in 2oo8 or 2ol9 had\nsome minimal relevance, it would be substantially outweighed by the dangers of confusing the\nissues and misleading the jury. As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\nirrelevant decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\ncircumstances”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\ncircumstances of its creation. As the Court is aware, those circumstances were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>.

Discussion\nof those issues would be all the more confusing to the jury because it involves decisions of a\ndifferent prosecuting authority, because the USAO-SDFL resolved its investigation before\nsignificant investigative steps were completed, and because the USAO-SDFL investigation did\nnonetheless generate inculpatory material as to the defendant. To evaluate the evidence, jurors\nwould also need to understand the sequencing of the various investigations into Epstein and the\ndefendant, so they could understand which witnesses and evidence were available to which law\nenforcement agencies and prosecutors at what times. The history of various investigations into\nEpstein reaches back 2o years, and a review of that history would create an extensive sideshou.\nAny marginal probative value of evidence of the Government’s charging decisions is\nsubstantially outweighed by the extended digression and confusion that such evidence would\nrequire.\n\nThird, eliciting information about past charging decisions would be hearsay. See White,\n692 F.3d at 244-45 (declining to decide whether the evidence in that case was hearsay); id. at\n253 (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (“[A]s the majority opinion observes, hearsay problems abound in\nthis case; yet, since neither party raised these issues on appeal, the Court has not decided whether\nthe charging documents . . . are admissible hearsay.”). Those charging decisions were made\ninternally by prosecutors at the USAO-SDFL or at this Office. No prosecutors from either office\nare testifying at trial, and no witness testifying at this trial can explain the Government’s past\ncharging decisions. Any knouledge that an FBI agent has, or that a witness has, about the basis\nfor a prior charging decision is based on statements made by prosecutors, which are themselves\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Report, Dkt.

The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006456.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 69\n\nAccordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented\nto the jury.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagelo of 52\nl29-l, 2ol2 WL l565o99 (E.D.

That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is irrelevant and\nshould be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l8 of 375\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts & Sciences, elected Fellou, 2oo3\n\nNational Academy of Sciences, elected 2oo4.\n\nGrawemeyer Prize in Psychology (for “Outstanding Ideas in the Science of Psychology”), 2oo5\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Corresponding Fellou (Scotland’s National Academy of Science & Leters,\nEst l783). 2oo5\n\nDistinguished Member of Psi Chi (The National Honor Society in Psychology), 2oo5\n\nLauds & Laurels, Faculty Achievement Award, University of California- Irvine, (for “great professional\nprominence in their field” in research, teaching and public service; 9” recipient in UCI history), 2oo5\n\nIreland Distinguished Visiting Scholar Prize, 2oo6\n\nAmerican Philosophical Society (U.S. oldest learned society, Est. l745 by Benjamin Franklin), 2oo6\n\nInternational Academy of Humanism, elected Humanist Laureate, 2oo7 (for “outstanding contributions to\nscience, law, and academic freedom, and to the public understanding of the human mind”)\n\nMcGovern Award Lecture, “honors outstanding behavioral scientists from around the world.” American\nAssoc. for the Advancement of Science, 2oo9\n\nDistinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law, American Psychology-Law Society, 2oo9.\n\nJoseph Priestley Award (for “achievement in the sciences”), Dickinson College, October, 2oo9.\n\nHouard Crosby Warren Medal, Society of Experimental Psychologists — Est. l9o4, (for “significant\ncontributions to the understanding of the phenomenology of human memory, especially its fragility and\nvulnerability to distortion”) 2olo\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Scientific Freedom and <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\n(for \"the profound impact that your pioneering research on human memory has had on the\nadministration of justice in the United States and abroad.\"), for year 2olo, ceremony Feb, 2oll\n\nForensic Mental Health Assn of California, William T.

Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009449.jpg": "Case ede eteielemeaiay Nar <7 | Saeenaeeaeeie eel as\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 3 of 29\nmade to the tribunal by the lawyer; (2) fail to disclose to the tribunal controlling\nlegal authority knoun to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the\nclient and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or (3) offer or use evidence that the\nlawyer knous to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by\nthe lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to knou of its\nfalsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if\nnecessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

I think it’s more appropriate.\n29. This colloquy must be read in its (rather brief) entirety, that is, as a whole. Trzaskoma’s\nstatement implies that the answer to the Court’s question from Brune & Richard would not be\nthat it had no information at all. It would not require a leter to say only that. It is, instead, clear\nthat Trzakoma had something “additional...to offer,” and chose to accept the Court’s invitation\nto say it in a leter, which was done on July 2l in a fashion that adequately disclosed the firm’s\nearlier research and internal communications on the subject. “The general rule is that statements\nmust be taken in context, and that related parts of a document must be taken together. That a\nhasty reader might take the first paragraph out of context is not in the present circumstances\nenough to brand the memorandum as false.” The memorandum must be “read as a whole.”\nYoung v.

The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J.

Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009894.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 25 of 32\n\nAt any hearing it is the Court’s job to evaluate the evidence presented, not present the\nevidence. The evidence elicited should be the product of all available investigation and research.\nIn Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 976 (9th Cir. l998), cited favorably by the government,\nJudge Kozinski explained the perils of a court conducting a juror bias inquiry with incomplete\ninformation or failing to ask critical questions. \"[A] judge investigating juror bias must find\nfacts, not make assumptions . . . [I]t was the trial court’s obligation to develop the relevant facts\non the record, not merely presume them. The judge’s lack of verve in pursuing the mater casts\ndoubt on his findings.” /d. at 976-77. The Ninth Circuit en banc opinion also was critical of the\ntrial judge’s refusal to allou the defense to subpoena a critical witness of the bias. \"Where juror\nmisconduct or bias is credibly alleged, the trial judge cannot wait for defense counsel to spoon\nfeed him every bit of information which would make out a case of juror bias; rather, the judge\nhas an independent <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to satisfy himself that the allegation of bias is unfounded.\" /d.\nat 978.\n\nIf the Court is charged with the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> questioning Juror No. 5o, what resources\nwill the Court use to uncover any statements and misstatements made by Juror No. 5o? Will the\nCourt investigate Juror No. 5o’s motives? Will the Court hire an investigator to find all of the\nposts made by Juror No. 5o about the trial? Having witnessed Juror No. 5o during the trial and\nhaving previously questioned Juror No. 5o -- both through a writen questionnaire and in person -\n- under the government’s farcical hearing the Court would be a (l) witness, (2) inquisitor, (3)\nfactfinder and (4) sole decision maker.

Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010128.jpg": "Cees PAROAP ORE DARN ema War <-¥ l FiSHORS PAPO ab ate e OS6F difll/l 7\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 3 of 29\nmade to the tribunal by the lawyer; (2) fail to disclose to the tribunal controlling\nlegal authority knoun to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the\nclient and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or (3) offer or use evidence that the\nlawyer knous to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by\nthe lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to knou of its\nfalsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if\nnecessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010129.jpg": "CaesPACOAB OES DARN l Remar iGAaee O FSS DAP ab atene l36 afl 7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the disclosure duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory disclosure rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary.

The Court’s decision not to do so and to refer the jurors to the existing\njury instructions, which had caused the confusion in the first place, was erroneous and resulted in\na constructive amendment and/or variance by permiting the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell on the\nMann Act counts based on an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. See\nUnited States v. Millstein, 4ol F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“When the trial evidence or the jury\ncharge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the\nindictment, the indictment has been constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the\nCourt should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.!\n\nA. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent\n\nRequirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court erred when it concluded that that the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and\ndeclined to give the jury a supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l26-4o). In fact, the text of the Jury\nNote is straightforward and indicates on its face that the jurors had an incorrect understanding of\nthe intent requirement for Count Four that needed to be clarified with a supplemental instruction.\nThe Note reads:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\n(Court Exhibit #l5). Stated slightly differently, but using the same words that the jurors\nthemselves used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the follouing:\n' The government contends that this argument is “beter framed as a challenge to the Court’s response to the jury\nnote or a challenge to the jury instructions in the form of a constructive amendment argument.” (Opp. at 2o). It is\nnot clear to the defense hou these arguments differ in any material respect from the one we are advancing. For the\nsake of clarity, we are claiming that the Court’s response to the Jury Note was erroneous and resulted in a\nconstructive amendment/variance.\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagellof 24\nnote asking a similar question about Annie Farmer’s testimony. See Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can we\nconsider Annie’s testimony as conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But\nthe Jury Note did not say that, nor did it contain the phrase “in part.” Instead, the Jury Note\nasked a much more specific question about whether the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four if it found that she (l) intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico\nand (2) aided with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. The\ngovernment’s speculation about what the jury may have meant cannot alter the clear text and\nmeaning of the Jury Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the intent\nrequirement necessary for Count Four and needed to be given a supplemental instruction to\nremedy the confusion.?\n\nB. The Court Erred When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental\n\nInstruction Clarifying the Intent Requirement for Count Four.\n\nThe Court further erred when it declined to give the jury a supplemental instruction, as\nrequested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement for Count Four — namely, that the\ngovernment had to prove that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New\nYork. The Jury Note shoued not only that the jury had a mistaken understanding of the law\nconcerming intent, but also indicated that the jury might convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four\nbased an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. At that point, it was the\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the Court to give the jury a supplemental instruction “to enable it to assess the\nevidence within the proper legal framework and to reach a rational verdict” and to avoid a\nconstructive amendment of the charges. Parker, 9o3 F.2d at lol; see also Gross, 2ol7 WL\n3 The government chides the defense for engaging in speculation about what the jury may have been thinking before\nsending the Jury Note. (Opp. l7-l9). The defense engaged in that discussion to explain why the proof at trial may\nhave led the jury to focus on Jane’s testimony about the conduct in New Mexico with respect to Count Four. But the\nCourt need not rely on that analysis. The Jury Note speaks for itself. The jury was focused on Jane’s abuse in New\nMexico and misunderstood the intent requirement necessary to convict under Count Four.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel3 of 24\nwithin the state of New York. (See Instr. No. l7, l9, 2l). To lawyers, that may seem obvious\nbecause we are familiar with the concept of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial\nreach of state criminal statutes. But to a juror who does not have legal training, it is not so\nobvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could have easily (but\nmistakenly) determined that the sexual abuse Jane described in New Mexico was “sexual activity\nfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law,” as\nlong as it met all the elements of Section l3o.55, even though all of the conduct took place in\nNew Mexico. It follous, then, that the jury could have mistakenly believed that if they found\nthat Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed to\nNew York, that was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.\n\nUltimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused on this point. The\nconfusion was clear on the face of the Jury Note and needed to be corrected. The defense’s\nproposed supplemental instruction would have clarified this very issue. It stated in relevant part:\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the\n\nGovernment has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported\n\nJane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of\n\nNew York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nDkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained that the instruction needed to be\ngiven because, according to the Jury Note, the jury did not understand that Count Four “requires\nan intent to violate New York law, and you can’t violate this section of New York law in New\nMexico.” (Tr. 3l54) (emphasis added). But the Court declined to give this instruction, even\nthough neither the Court nor the government questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3l48-54).+ The\n* The Court disagreed with the appropriateness of the first paragraph of the defense’s proposed instruction and\nquestioned the accuracy of the third paragraph. But neither the Court nor the government challenged the accuracy of\nthe second paragraph, which is quoted above. (Tr. 3l48-54). Moreover, even if the Court disagreed with the entire\ntext of the defense’s proposed instruction, it was the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to give the jury an appropriate instruction\nthat clarified the intent requirement and prevented a constructive amendment.\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagel2ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for.

The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator....

According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen.

Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense.

I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas.

Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 52 of 77\n“always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.” We were quizzed on these\nprinciples constantly and had to regularly report examples of hou we folloued them.

For example, | think it\nis no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),\nsubmersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and\nreactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a\n“flipbberti-gibbet” or a “socialite”, terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many\nsiblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which | deeply appreciated. She also\nhelped our mother greatly in her late life and exhibited deep caring and concern which | noticed\npersonally on many occasions. For example she dropped everything and flew to France at her\noun expense to help me with medical issues our mother was having and to just be there to\ncomfort her. She also did not hesitate to help her many personal friends with their problems not\nonly with kindness but practical help too and did not ask for anything in return.\n\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies and\norganizations which created products and services, as well as employment. An important\nexample is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit,\nThe TerraMar Project, with the mission to create a \"global ocean community\" based on the\nidea of shared ounership and <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the global “commons”—the high seas or\ninternational waters.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 26 of55\n“one involving five or more knouing participants” (internal quotation marks and emphasis\nomited)). Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v.

Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 44 of55\n“misrepresent[ed] key facts to Pretrial Services and, by extension, the Court.” (PSR\nl72, December 28, 2o2o Opinion at l4-l6).\n\ne On November l, 2o2l, the Court allocuted the defendant about whether she had\nengaged in plea discussions with the Government. Although the Court’s question\ncalled for a yes or no answer about plea offers, the defendant elected to volunteer\nthe follouing: “I have not commited any crime.” (November l, 2o2l Tr. at ll3).\nThat was a lie.\n\ne In preparation for sentencing, the defendant was interviewed by the Probation\nOffice, and she refused to provide any information about the circumstances of her\nmarriage and, accordingly, the Probation Office was unable to verify these facts.\n(PSR at l45). Moreover, the defendant reported that she had almost no assets, a\nsharp contrast from the defendant’s earlier representation to the Court—in pursuit\nof bail—that she had approximately $22 million in assets. (PSR l72). In short,\nthe defendant apparently decides when she wishes to disclose facts to the Court,\nand those facts shift when it serves the defendant’s interests.\n\nMoreover, even nou, at sentencing, the defendant has shoun no acceptance of\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, and her submission fails to even mention, much less accept <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for, the\nharm she has caused her victims. Instead, her entire submission is an effort to cast herself as a\nvictim: of her father, of Epstein, of the media, of prosecutors, of the Bureau of Prisons. Although\nmuch of the defendant’s sentencing memorandum aims to cast aspersions on the Government,\nthese claims are baseless. This Office did what it always does in any case: it folloued the facts\nand law. The investigation uncovered that the defendant commited terrible crimes, and that is\nwhat this case is about.

The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range. Given the magnitude, breadth, and\nsophistication of the conduct in this case, those interests are best served by a significant term of\nimprisonment. The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is responsible.\n\nA Guidelines sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document696- Filed o6/29/22 Page5of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\nSheet 3A — Supervised Release\nJudgment—Page a a of oO.\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSTANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION\n\nAs part of your supervised release, you must comply with the follouing standard conditions of supervision.

Unlike Ms. Maxwell’s earlier subpoena to Boies Schiller & Flexner\n(BSF), which the Court declined to issue, Dkt.

Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena seeks production aft trial (not pretrial), and\nit also requests that before the responsive material is produced to her for inspection, this Court\nconduct an in camera review. Combined with the narrouness of her request, Ms. Maxwell has\nsuggested careful procedures to balance her need for the material and the accusers’ interests in\nconfidentiality.\n\nEveryone agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena specifically identifies the requested\nmaterial, and there is no meaningful dispute that the material she seeks is both relevant and not\notherwise procurable. (The government and Accuser-2 offer cursory arguments about relevance,\nwhich are easily dismissed.) Instead, the disagreement concerns whether the material is\nadmissible and whether enforcement of the subpoena would be unreasonable and oppressive.\nConsidering Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense and to confront her\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page /7 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Evidence is either relevant or it isn’t, and “unless an exception applies, all ‘relevant\nevidence is admissible.’” White, 692 F.3d at 246.\n\nUnder this “very lou” standard and “very broad” definition, the materials Ms. Maxwell\nseeks are relevant.

The subpoena is also more narrouly tailored, including just four\nrequests rather than twelve. In addition, the subpoena is returnable at trial, not pretrial. And most\nsignificantly, nou unlike then, the Court isswed the requested subpoena after considering Ms.\nMaxwell’s brief in support. Because a Court “must be satisfied that the subpoena complies with\nthe requirements of the Rule” before the Court “issues a Rule l7(c) subpoena,” the Court has\nalready (if preliminarily) determined that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to be proper.

In other words, a defendant cannot\nl9 avoid criminal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for her oun conduct by\n2o deliberately closing her eyes or remaining purposefully\nal ignorant of facts which would confirm to her that she was\n22 engaged in unlawful conduct.\n23 With respect to the conspiracy counts, you must also\n24 keep in mind that there is an important difference between\n25 knouingly and intentionally participating in a conspiracy, on\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014658.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 768 Filed o8/lo/22 Pagelofl\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AM?\na)\nUSA / Plaintiff(s) )\n)\nVv. ) Case No.: 2o Cr 33o\n\n)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL\n\nOT)\n\nDefendant(s) )\n)\n)\nNOTICE OF FILING OF OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT\n\nNotice is hereby given that an official transcript of a )N F E RE N C held on l 2/ 2o/ 2 l\nhas been filed by the court reporter/transcriber in the above-captioned mater.\n\nRedaction responsibilities apply to the atorneys of record or pro se parties, even if the person requesting\nthe transcript is a judge or a member of the public or media.\n\nThe parties have seven (7) calendar days from the date of filing of this NOTICE to file with the court\nany NOTICE OF INTENT TO REQUEST REDACTION of this transcript.

In fact,\nthe phrase “in such district,” repeated twice, implies that the scope of\n5 United States Atorney’s Manual § 9-27.64l (2oo7).\n'6 An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, ch. 2o, § 35, l Stat. 73, 92-93\n(l789) (emphasis added).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool4862\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Pagel4ofl58 l4\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl so around January of l998.\n\n2 Q.

Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAnnie Farmer submits the follouing statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed\n\nmotion for bail.\nis 2K 3\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this mater and once more\nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020307.jpg": "Cas6dse@ trai s3osAaientDGcMherY/2o2l , RikDG38, 572g Page Wof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of\nthe three accusers from the l99os, as we have been doing, the defense will nou have to spend\nconsiderable time and resources investigating allegations of new conduct in a completely\ndifferent time period involving numerous additional witnesses, and with all of the difficulties that\nCOVID restrictions still place on a meaningful defense investigation.\n\nWe do not want to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for a continuance.

Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to\nplead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. /d. In exchange, the U.S. Atorney’s Office agreed not to charge him\nwith federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his\nconduct between 2ool and 2oo7. /d. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of\nhis “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\nobserved, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.\nOPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S. Atorney’s\npromise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added “with litle\ndiscussion or consideration by the prosecutors.” /d. at l69, l85. The report concluded that the\nU.S. Atorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,\nbut nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” /d. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell\ncontends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of\nJeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal\nlimitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New\nYork. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the $l superseding indictment.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020805.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel87 of 2o8\nA-l83\nCase l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page ll of l5\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\nfollous:\n7A.

They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 employment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

Negotiations began in January 2oo7, lasted for a period of eight\nmonths, and were “extensive” and involved the Department of Justice.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.| OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n: As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age\nof l8.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021183.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, SA_Q 3536o38, Pagell of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9 of 348\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021194.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22 of 258\nSA-2o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 348\nI.

OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021222.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EAS 3536o38, Page5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “‘will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021227.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NR 3536o38, Page55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts.

The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021325.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TST 3536o38, Pagel53 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM §§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021331.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ET 3536o38, Pagel59 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l57 of 348\n4. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n7o4 OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021333.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l59 | 3536o38, Pagel6l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021334.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6o. 3536o38, Pagel62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 348\ndifferent points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”’ In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nI. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021335.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel63 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 348\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021348.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel76 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l74 of 348\n\nThe USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.**? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘|encouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021354.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l8o | 3536o38, Pagel82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8o of 348\n\nMenchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, ‘‘a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks.

Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.”*’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[i]t was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\neet Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021363.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l89 | 3536o38, Pagel9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafaia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaia, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “‘[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021372.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l98 3536o38, Page2oo of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l98 of 348\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and . . . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.”**\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\noth Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\nams Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\n\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021397.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page225 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nie U.S. Department of Fustice\nSir Federal Bureau of Investigation\nel : i i FBI - West Palm Beach\nae pl Suite 3oo\nba 5o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) §33-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 28, 2oo6\nRe: Cate Neriter\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal\ncrime.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021410.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 336. 3536o38, Page238 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 348\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021422.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 348 3536o38, Page25o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n32o CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021451.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page2l of 2l7\nSA-275\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 275 of 348\n(4) During court proceedings, a responsible official shall ensure that a victim is provided a\nwaiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the defendant and defense\nwitnesses.\n(ce) Definitions\n(2) the term “victim” means a person that has suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary\nharm as a result of the commission of acrime....\nIl.

Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°° Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.*°! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”4°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en bane.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*”\n\n228 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing.

We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*’” Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[alve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021475.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER _399 3536o39, Page45 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 299 of 348\nresolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.**° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n2o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021476.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page46 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.**? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI.

Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.”*78 The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“Tml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.**° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021499.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page69 of 2l7\nSA-323\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 323 of 348\n\nIN RE:\n\nINVESTIGATION OF\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\n/\nNON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter “Epstein”) is reported to have\ncommited offenses against the United States from in or around 2ool through in or around\nOctober 2oo5, including:\n\n(l) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to commit\nan offense against the United States, that is, to use a facility or means of interstate\nor foreign commerce to knouingly persuade, induce, or entice minor females to\nengage in prostitution, in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section\n2422(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States Code, Section 37l;\n\n(2) knouingly and willfully conspiring with others knoun and unknoun to travel in\ninterstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females, in violation of Title l8,\nUnited States Code, Section 2423(b); all in violation of Title l8, United States\nCode, Section 2423(e);\n\n(3) using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knouingly\npersuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Sections 2422(b) and 2;\n\n(4) traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual\nconduct, as defined in l8 U.S.C. § 2423(f), with minor females; in violation of\nTitle l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting, enticing,\nand obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had not atained\nthe age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act as\ndefined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for his behavior by his\n\nTlaye l ob 4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021517.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o39, Page87 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34l of 348\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.\n\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\nfollous:\n7A.

Since the FBI and the Justice Department\ninspector General are looking into the Epstein case she said she could not speak about any specifics.\n“We have some bad staff,” Hawk Sawyer said. \"We want rid of those bed staff who don’t do theirjob.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.’ Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023008.tif": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n? 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023009.tif": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023010.tif": "find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nX\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23olo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023013.jpg": "DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nOFFICE OF\nPROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span>\nREPORT\nInvestigation into the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s\nResolution of Its 2oo6-2oo8 Federal Criminal Investigation of\nJeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation\nNovember 2o2o\nNOTE: THIS REPORT CONTAINS SENSITIVE, PRIVILEGED, AND PRIVACY\nACT PROTECTED INFORMATION.

As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nIW. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023022.tif": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n? 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o22\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023023.tif": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023024.tif": "initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nX\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023032.jpg": "II. ©OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA l... eee l34\nA.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023057.tif": "Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get ... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“green light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023060.tif": "also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n33 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\n34 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.tif": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly experienced trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°8\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n39 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023076.tif": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”°’ Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.® Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023126.tif": "a proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl.

The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023163.tif": "cooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement.

If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023169.tif": "4, FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation.\n\nFRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice\nof law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\n\nIn Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2ooo), the court noted that FRPC\n4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to\n“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 4l So. 3d l66, l72\n(Fla. 2olo), for example, an atorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s\nmater resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due\nto the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!\n\n2ol OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,\nhouever, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has\nadopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.\nThese “standards,” houever, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the\nABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional\ndiscipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for\ncivil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider\nthe ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.\n\nl3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023171.tif": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023172.tif": "different points in time, and regarding different decisions. Menchel, for example, participated in\nformulating the USAO’s initial writen offer to the defense, but he had no involvement with actions\nor decisions made after August 3, 2oo7. Sloman was absent during part of the most intense\nnegotiations in September 2oo7 and did not see the final, signed version of the NPA until he\nreturned. Villafafia and Lourie participated in the negotiations, and Lourie either made decisions\nduring the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the defense and State Atorney’s Office, or at least\nindicated agreement pending Acosta’s approval. In any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,\n\nMenchel’s, Lourie’s, and Villafafia’s involvement, they acted with the knouledge and approval of\n\nAcosta.\n\nUnder OPR’s analytical framework, an atorney who makes a good faith atempt to\nascertain the obligations and standards imposed on the atorney and to comply with them in a given\nsituation does not commit professional misconduct. Evidence that an atorney made a good faith\natempt to ascertain and comply with the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not\nlimited to, the fact that the atorney consulted with a supervisor.”°? In this regard, OPR’s\nframework is similar to a standard provision of the professional conduct rules of most state bars,\nwhich specify that a subordinate lawyer does not engage in misconduct if that lawyer acts in\naccordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of\nprofessional duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, in addition to the fact that OPR did not\nfind a violation of a clear and unambiguous standard as discussed belou, OPR concludes that\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia did not commit professional misconduct with respect to\nany aspect of the NPA because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.\n\nIW. OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL <span class=\"highlight\">RESPONSIBILITY</span> RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA\nA central issue OPR addressed in its investigation relating to the NPA was whether any of\n\nthe subjects, in developing, negotiating, or entering into the NPA, violated any clear and\n\nunambiguous standard established by rule, regulation, or policy. OPR does not find professional\nmisconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous\nstandard. OPR considered three specific areas: (l) standards implicated by the decision to decline\n\na federal court prosecution; (2) standards implicated by the decision to resolve the federal\n\ninvestigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and (3) standards implicated by any of the\n\nNPA’s provisions, including the promise not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed\n\nbelou, OPR concludes that in each area, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his\n\ndecisions were based on corrupt or improper influences, the U.S. Atorney possessed broad\ndiscretionary authority to proceed as he saw fit, authority that he could delegate to subordinates,\nand that Acosta’s exercise of his discretionary authority did not breach any clear and unambiguous\nstandard. As a result, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\n\n2o2 The failure to fully advise a supervisor of relevant and material facts can warrant a finding that the subordinate\n\natorney has not acted in “good faith.” OPR did not find evidence supporting such a conclusion here, and Acosta did\n\nnot claim that he was unaware of material facts needed to make his decision.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023173.tif": "unambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.””\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7°4 A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o3 See, e.g., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 US. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.tif": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023186.tif": "The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues\npresented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have\nprevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly\nrecommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she\ncontinued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterban and others also believed that the\ngovernment would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of\nthem were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein\nprosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear hou many expressed a willingness to testify at a\ntrial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for deciding hou to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and\nbenefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge\ndisposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAlthough evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about\nwinning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge\ndisposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as\nopposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records\na memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a\nstate-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7.\n\nAccording to Acosta, “In 2oo6, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States\nAtorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage\nteens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he\ndeveloped “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not\nstepping on something that is a purely local mater, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for\nthe sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding\nthat the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Atorney’s\nOffice had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender\nregistration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest\ninjustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.\nAcosta acknouledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have\nviewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a\n“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case\nlay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,\nand a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration\nthat would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both\ntold OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had\nthe terms offered to the defense on July 3l, 2oo7. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have\nplayed a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.\n\n22o Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span>\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023192.tif": "Menchel told OPR that when he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had a social\nrelationship, which included, in 2oo3, “a handful of dates over a period of two to three weeks. We\ndecided that . . . this was probably best not to pursue, and we mutually agreed to not do that.”?°\nApart from that, he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and he asserted that this was knoun\nin the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with Sanchez “changed dramatically”\nwhen she left the office for private practice, and that by the time he became involved in the Epstein\ninvestigation, he had dated and married his wife, and his contact with Sanchez would “most likely”\nhave been at office events and when she atended his wedding.””’ Menchel added, “[T]hat was\nthree and a half years [prior] for a very brief period of time, and I don’t think I gave it a moment’s\nthought.”\n\nWhen asked by OPR about the basis for the decision to make an offer of a two-year term\nof incarceration, Menchel said that he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did\nnot recall hou the office arrived at that figure. In response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that\nhis relationship with Sanchez did “[n]ot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Moreover,\nMenchel asserted that the contemporaneous documentary record supports a conclusion that it was\nAcosta, not Menchel, who made the decision to resolve the case with the two-year term.\n\nOPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements\nto OPR from Menchel, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and concludes that there is no evidence\nsupporting the suggestion that the plea was instigated by Menchel as a favor to defense counsel.\nThe USAO’s first plea overture to defense counsel, which took place sometime before June 26,\n2oo7, occurred when Menchel spoke with Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the federal\ncase with a state plea that required jail time and sexual offender registration. According to the\nemail, “[iJt was a non-starter” for the defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in\nearly July 2oo7, Menchel told her that his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution\nwas made with Acosta’s “full knouledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR that\nalthough he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based\nresolution, he was certain Menchel would not have discussed this potential resolution with defense\ncounsel “without having discussed it with me.” Moreover, the defense did not immediately\n226 Acosta, Sloman, and Lourie each told OPR that in 2oo7, he was not aware that Menchel had previously dated\nSanchez. OPR questioned the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer regarding whether Menchel had an\nobligation to inform his supervisors of his dating relationship. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer said that it\nwould depend on “hou long the relationship was and hou compromised the individual felt he might appear to be,”\nbut he would have expected Menchel to raise the issue with Acosta. The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR\nthat if he had been approached for advice at the time, he would have asked for more facts, but “[g]iven the sensitivity\nof the [Epstein] mater, [my advice] would probably have been to tell him to step back and let somebody else take it\nover.” Menchel told OPR that if his relationship with Sanchez had turned into something more than a handful of\ndates, he would have advised his supervisors. Although OPR does not conclude Menchel’s prior relationship with\nSanchez influenced the Epstein investigation, OPR assesses that it would have been prudent for Menchel to have\ninformed his supervisors so they could make an independent assessment as to whether his continued involvement in\nthe Epstein investigation might create the appearance of a loss of impartiality.\n\n227 Menchel’s Outlook records also indicate he scheduled lunch with Sanchez on at least one occasion, in early\n2oo6, after she left the USAO.\n228 In addition, Villafafia recalled Menchel stating at the July 26, 2oo7 meeting that “Alex has decided to offer\na two year state deal.”\nl54\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023201.tif": "sentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafania, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.**° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

The court declined to order the\nadditional redactions.\nl63\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023209.tif": "Notably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023210.tif": "[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state .. .\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\n\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein\nwould have become final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. In\nAcosta’s view, “the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>” in this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back-\nstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no miscarriage of justice.”*4’ Acosta told OPR\nthat he understood the PBPD would not have brought Epstein to the FBI’s atention if the State\nAtorney had pursued charges that required Epstein’s incarceration. Acosta therefore decided that\nthe USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state to do more and require Epstein\nto serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender.\n\nAcosta’s reasoning was flawed and unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated references to a\n“miscarriage of justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the “manifestly inadequate” language used\nin the Petite policy to define the circumstances in which the federal government may proceed with\na criminal case after a completed state prosecution. Nothing in the Petite policy, houever, requires\nsimilar restraint when the federal government pursues a case in the absence of a completed state\nprosecution, even if the state is already investigating the same offense. The goal of the Petite\npolicy is to prevent multiple prosecutions for the same offense, not to compel the federal\ngovernment to defer to a parallel state interest in a case, particularly one in which state officials\ninvolved in the state prosecution expressed significant concerns about it, and there were questions\nregarding the state prosecutor’s commitment to the case. Acosta told OPR that “there are any\nnumber of instances where the federal government or the state government can proceed, and state\ncharges are substantially less and different, and .. . the federal government . . . stands aside and\nlets the state proceed.” The fact that the federal government can allou the state to proceed with a\nprosecution, houever, does not mean the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in\na mater in which a distinct and important federal interest exists. Indeed, the State Atorney told\nOPR that the federal government regularly takes over cases initiated by state investigators,\ntypically because federal charges result in “the best sentence.”\n\nEpstein was facing a substantial sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.***\nDespite the Ashcroft Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most serious readily\nprovable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state to do a litle bit more” does not approach\nthat standard. In fact, Acosta conceded during his OPR interview that the NPA did not represent\nan “appropriate punishment” in the federal system, nor even “the best outcome in the state system,”\nand that if the investigation of Epstein had originated with the FBI, rather than as a referral from\nthe PBPD, the outcome might have been different. As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to\n247 Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n248 Villafafia estimated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment.\nl72\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.tif": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.tif": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023233.tif": "victim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na7 US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title ls “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023234.tif": "C. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.

THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n27 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023235.tif": "aioe U.S, Department of Fug lice\nAgree Federal Bureau of Tevesligalion\nae Ti: it FB] - West Palm Peach\nae 5o5 South Mtagler Drive\nWest Pola Beach.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.tif": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n278 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023248.tif": "for [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*% Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n3o5 The Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\n<span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023260.tif": "We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\n\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\n\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].’°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2326o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023262.tif": "if you heve additional questlans which involve this mater, please contact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde fhe.file number located al the top of this leter, Please remnemder, your participation\nin the notification part of this program is voluntary.

Villafaia, the FBI, and the CEOS Trial Atorney Interview Victims\n\nAs Villafafia resumed organizing the case for charging and trial, the FBI case agent\nprovided Villafafia with a list of “the l9 identified victims we are planning on using in” the federal\ncharges and noted that she and her co-case agent wanted to further evaluate some additional\nvictims.*°° In Washington, D.C., CEOS assigned a Trial Atorney to the Epstein case in order to\nbring expertise and “a national perspective” to the mater.**!\n\nOn January l8, 2oo8, one atorney representing a victim and her family contacted Sloman\nby telephone, stating that he planned to file civil litigation against Epstein on behalf of his clients,\nwho were “frustrated with the lack of progress in the state’s investigation” of Epstein. The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\n\n33l The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim coordinator.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had restitution rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”4!’? Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023310.tif": "argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023311.tif": "resolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to atend the plea\nhearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast\nwith Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s atorneys, which included the unusual\ncourtesy of allouing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This\ncontrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the\npublic.\n\nNothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of\ndetermining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that\nall of the knoun federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with\nhis decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised\npoor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,\nbut also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to\nimplement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>\nfor making notifications entirely to the State Atorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO\nand the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that\nresolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with\nvictims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally\nsought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state\nproceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to atend a hearing\nthat was related to their oun cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with\nforthrightness and dignity.\n\nV. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER\nORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN\nWHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID\nNOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS\nFrom September 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\n\nstate court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three\n\nvictims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the\nfederal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents\ninteracted with several victims and their atorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ atorney\n\nBradley Edwards to encourage him to atend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform\n\nvictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nAs described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and\nco-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.“° After speaking to three victims, houever,\nthe FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary\ndamages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent\nshould Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent\ntold OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue\nMr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case\n43o Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to\nVillafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that\nshe was unhappy with the resolution.\n\n273\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023312.tif": "agent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “‘was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\n#3l FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\n\n432 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n274\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023315.tif": "atend the hearing. In his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was no possible way I could have\nbelieved that this state plea could affect the federal investigation or the rights of my clients in that\nfederal investigation.”\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel stated that the government “seemingly” deferred to\nEpstein’s atorneys’ requests not to notify the victims about the NPA, and that in sending the\nJanuary and May 2oo8 FBI leters, the government’s efforts “seem to have graduated from passive\nnondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.”**’ Although both the appellate\ncourt and district court focused on the FBI’s leters for which OPR concludes that neither Villafafia,\nSloman, nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered the courts’ analyses in evaluating whether\nsimilar representations Villafafia made to the victims whom she interviewed on January 3l and\nFebruary l, 2oo8, and to Edwards, were misleading. Therefore, OPR considered whether\nVillafafia’s statements that the mater was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the\nvictims whom she interviewed or Edwards about the NPA violated FRPC 4-4.l(a), 4-8.4(c), or\n4-8.4(d).\n\nFRPC 4-4.l(a) prohibits an atorney from “knouingly mak[ing] a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person” during the representation of a client. The FRPC defines\n“knouingly” as “denot[ing] actual knouledge of the fact in question” and states that such\nknouledge may be “inferred from circumstances.” The comment to FRPC 4-4.l states that\n“TmlJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that\nare the equivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[f]or\ndishonest conduct that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.l(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)\nrequires evidence that the atorney knew the statement in question was false. Under FRPC\n4-8.4(c), the intent requirement can be satisfied “merely by shouing that the conduct was\ndeliberate or knouing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;\ninstead the issue is whether he or she purposefully acted.”**? In Feinberg, the court concluded that\nthe prosecutor violated FRPC 4-4.l and 4-8.4(c) and (d) by deliberately making untruthful\nstatements to a defense atorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help the\ndefendant by making the statements.“° In this case, Villafafia was fully aware of the signed NPA\nwhen she interviewed the victims on January 3l and February l, 2oo8, and when she spoke to\nEdwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The\nquestion is whether this omission amounted to a knouing false statement or misrepresentation.\n\nOne difficulty is determining what Villafafia actually said during conversations that\nparticipants were asked to recall many years later. With respect to three of the victims whom she\ninterviewed in January and February 2oo8, Villafafia contended that she discussed the agreement\nwith them, even if she did not specifically refer to it as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and as\n437 Wild, 955 F.3d at ll99-l2oo.\n\n438 See R.

Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">Responsibility</span> Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023320.tif": "to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n“a7 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts.

At approximately 8:3o a.m., CO l\nescorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the\nDay Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for his\ndaily meeting with his atorneys. During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO l\ndiscussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer. The Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared follouing Epstein’s death,\nthat he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new\ncellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant. Houever, the OIG did not credit the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in\nfact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.\n6 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n62 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n& Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9.\n6 Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave\nthe facility.\n6 The OIG did not find that CO l failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-\nof-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\n\n99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023471.tif": "inmate was accounted for.’”° Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and\nthe numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the\ninstitutional count be deemed “cleared” or completed.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or\nsigned a false count slip to create the impression that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability\nresponsibilities when, in fact, they had not.’”” These individuals admited to the OIG that instead of\nperforming their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed\nwere in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the\ndocuments knouing that they falsely atested to having completed the counts.

Poor Judgment Regarding the Use of Overtime\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York supervisory staff\nrequested that a staff member fill an overtime position within the SHU, which resulted in that staff member\nworking three shifts back-to-back, that is, 24 hours straight.\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the BOP and unions representing BOP employees provides\nthat “[o]rdinarily, the minimum time off between shifts will be seven and one-half (7 %) hours, and the\n7% The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n7 The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel signed the 4 p.m. count slip; Noel and the Material Handler signed\nthe lo p.m. count slip; and Noel and Thomas signed the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips.\n78 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check Sheet.”\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> to do so.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023481.tif": "8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera\nsystems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to\nrecord video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system\nfunctionality checks.\n\nAs discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels\nof leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s\ndeath, no one was tasked with the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of checking the security camera system on a routine basis\nto ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2ol9, video from approximately half\nof the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for\nll days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera\nsystems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure\nthe camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video\nstreams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can\npotentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that\nthe BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security\ncamera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct\nperiodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action\nas soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable.

Horouitz announced today the release of a report\nof investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey\nEpstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New\nYork). Epstein died by suicide on August lo, 2ol9 while in BOP custody.

Among other\nthings, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in\nhis locked cell on August lo at approximately 6:3o a.m.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG\nalso found that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after about lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:oo p.m. on\nAugust 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to shou that they had been\nperformed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his\ndeath. Follouing a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged\ncriminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the\nemployees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.\nAtorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

Once a judge signs the request for designation, the court\nmust send a copy to the USMS and Probation who will then contact\nDbscc. Since the inmate is not sentenced, he is not yet in Bureau\ncustody, therefore the Bureau cannot make the designation without\nan official request from the USMS to the Bureau in Grand Prairie.\nNeither the Legal Department ner any institution staff have a\nrole in the process. It is up to the atorneys on the criminal\ncase to make sure the order is processed as described in this\nparagraph. If questions arise, the atorneys may contact the\nDSCC {contact info. above).\nH. Health Services\n\nl. Sick Call\nInmates are advised during their initial screening and physical\nexamination that if they wish to be evaluated by the Health\nServices Department, they must submit @ sick call slip to the\ndepartment. It i858 imperative that inmate’s use this system, as\nit helps the department track requests and have inmates seen on a4\nfirst need to be seen basis. If an inmate has a verified chronic\ncondition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, etc.) he will be placed\nin a chronic care clinic and scheduled for appointments\nautomatically.\nSick call slips are available on the housing units and there is a\nsick call box on each unit in which to submit the slips. The\nsick call box on each housing unit will he emptied daily by a\nmember of Health Services Staff and given to the medical staff\nfor triage. Requests will be prioritized in accordance with\ngreatest medical need. Inmates will be charged a $2.oo co-pay\nfee for all non-chronic care, non-emergent appointments.\n\n2. Emergency Care\nAny time there is a medical emergency on a unit, the inmate\nshould notify the unit officer who can call the on-duty P.A.\n\n3. Medication\nWith regards to medication, MCC New York staff will make every\neffort to continue an inmate on a specific medication as long as\nthe inmate has proof that he is on that medication {a\nprescription, a prescription botle, ete.). Houever, for safety\nof staff and other inmates, there are several medications that an\ninmate may be on that are not on the national Bureau of Prisons\nformulary. In this instance, if medical staff find it necessary\nto prescribe a substitute medication, they will do se.

Cellmate Assignments\n\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the\nimportance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes\nconsultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision\nmaking of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members\npresent when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include\n\nan outline of the training and evidence of staff who atended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In\naddition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when\nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more\nappropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual\nTraining began the week of January 6, 2o2o, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2o2o.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025123.jpg": "Page 76l\nthe correct cell assignment noted. The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after\nthe reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, \"In the event of a suicide, institution staff,\nparticularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same\nlevel of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred.\" This policy further states, \"All possible\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025125.jpg": "Page 763\nAll staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the\nstaff suicide watch.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter. A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8. Re-establishing\nthe Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory\npsychologist to provide critical clinical services.\nStaffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction.

Atached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permiting staff monitored suicide watches in\nSHU.\nWith regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the <span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span> of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8. Re-establishing\nthe Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory\npsychologist to provide critical clinical services.\nStaffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction.

Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly\nmade Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no\nfootman: he loved luxury and, in his oun words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who\ncould shou the rich hou to live with their money. “I want people to understand the pouer, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">responsibility</span>, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote.

He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also\nto identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ...
