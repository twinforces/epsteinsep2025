See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000656.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page l8 of 86 l8\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl confidence in the prosecutors in the Southern District and the\n2 FBI to do a competent investigation.

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001137.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedg@s 4l 2o45\nll-l2).

Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason.

In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*?

The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI.

And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the\nguarantee of confidentiality provided by the Protective Order, the government trampled on\nMaxwell’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke\nin reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the Protective Order.\n\nThis Court should (l) suppress all evidence the government obtained from [A\nand any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions\nand all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. The “Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena\nduces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,\n4lo U.S. l, ll-l2 (l973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 2ol U.S. 43, 76 (l9o6), abrogated in part on\nother grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (l964)).\n\nThe government engages in a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct\nencroaches on an individual’s <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an\nexception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 22\ndegree to which the subpoena would reach private material of no pertinence to the grand jury’s\ninquiry.” See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-l5-o29, 828 F.3d at lo89. The Fourth Amendment\ndoes not allou such a sweeping search, which would be nothing but a modern-day general\nwarrant. Jd. at lo88.' This Court should suppress all evidence the government obtained from the\nsubpoena to x\n\nB. The government’s subpoena to i was an unconstitutional\n\nwarrantless Fourth Amendment search.\n\nApart from its overbreadth, the subpoena violated the Fourth Amendment because it\namounted to a warrantless search without probable cause.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. Katz, 389 U.S. at 35l. Thus, “when\nan individual ‘seeks to preserve something as private,’ and [her] expectation of privacy is ‘one\nthat society is prepared to recognize as reasonable,’ . . . that official intrusion into that private\nsphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported by probable cause.”\nCarpenter, l38 S. Ct. at 22l3 (quoting Smith, 442 U.S. at 74o). This definition of a what\nconstitutes a “search” “seeks to secure ‘the privacies of life’ against ‘arbitrary pouer’” and “to\nplace obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance.” Jd. at 22l4 (quoting Boyd,\nll6 US. at 63o; United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 58l, 595 (l948)). A “grand jury is . . . ‘without\npouer to invade a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.’” United\nStates v. Thomas, 736 F.3d 54, 6l (lst Cir. 2ol3) (quoting United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S.\n338, 346 (l974)).\n\n‘Tt is for this reason that this Court should grant Maxwell’s Motion for Discovery of every grand\njury subpoena. Without being able to examine the grand jury subpoenas, Maxwell cannot evaluate\nwhether other subpoenas issued by the grand jury in connection with this case are unconstitutionally\noverbroad, as the subpoena to Ts.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 22\n\nMaxwell had a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> expectation of privacy in her EE because\nshe reasonably sought to preserve them as private.

Ct. at 22l6 (quoting United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435,\n443 (l976)).\n\nIn Smith v. Maryland, the Court ruled that the government’s use of a pen register—a\ndevice used by telephone companies to record the outgoing phone numbers dialed on a landline\ntelephone—was not a search. By placing calls from his landline, the Court reasoned, Smith\n“voluntarily conveyed” the dialed numbers to the telephone company by “expos[ing] that\ninformation to its equipment in the ordinary course of business.” 442 U.S. at 744. The Court held\nthat Smith has “assumed the risk” that the telephone company’s records “would be divulged to\npolice.” /d. at 745.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Miller, the Court ruled that the government could subpoena\nan individual’s bank records, including several months of canceled checks, deposit slips, and\nmonthly statements. The Court explained that because the checks were “not confidential\ncommunications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions,” and because\nthe bank statements contained information “exposed to [bank] employees in the ordinary course\nof business,” Miller had only a limited expectation of privacy. 425 U.S. at 442. The Court\ndetermined that Miller had “take[n] the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the\ninformation [would] be conveyed by that person to the Government.” /d. at 443.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo256l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 22\n\nNeither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a\n<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I. First, Maxwell did\nnot “voluntarily convey” x sucd her, not the other way around.\nMoreover, Maxwell declined to answer 3\nOO ——SSC‘CCes\nRen. None of this was voluntary.\n\nSecond, Maxwell’s expectation of privacy in her i is not limited in\nthe way Miller’s expectation of privacy was limited in his bank records. To the contrary, both\nMaxwell’s J were confidential under the Protective Order. And while the Protective\nOrder did not apply to evidence produced at trial, the case setled before trial, thereby confirming\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> expectation that the I would not be shared outside the\natorneys working in the case and, if necessary, the district court.\n\nThird, Maxwell reasonably understood that the yy would not\nbe shared with the government.

Unlike in Smith and Miller, Maxwell did not “assume the risk” that her\nRe ould be divulged to the government.\n\nHad the government obtained the MY from Maxwell’s atorneys, there\nwould be no question that the government’s conduct would constitute a Fourth Amendment\nsearch. “[C]lients of an atorney maintain a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> expectation of privacy in their client files.”\nDeMassa v.

Because she did not voluntarily offer her I, and\nbecause she reasonably believed JJ was and would remain private under the\nProtective Order, Maxwell had a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> and reasonable expectation of privacy in her\nEe oven though the government obtained them from a third party other than\nher atorneys.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.\n\nMaxwell.\n\nThere can be no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are\ninflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

The\nphrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may well have\nbeen lawful: Accuser-3 was at or above the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times,\nand the indictment contains no suggestion that the alleged sexual activity involving Accuser-3\nwas nonconsensual. Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,\nhouever, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she\nparticipated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though\nirrelevant to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance\nthe government seeks.\n\nBecause the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both irrelevant to the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002763.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 2 of 5\n\nThe proposed redactions mostly satisfy this test. First, the Government’s brief in\nopposition to the Defendant’s pre-trial motions is a “judicial document” for purposes of the first\nelement of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir.\nl995). The Court thus concludes that there is a common law and a First Amendment\npresumption of access. /d. at l46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2\n(l978). The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions.

Kentucky, 448\nU.S. 98, lo4 (l98o).\n\nUnder the third party doctrine, the Fourth Amendment “does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by [the third party] to Government authorities.”\nUnited States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (l976). The Supreme Court has long held that “a person\nhas no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\nSmith v.

For example, in Carpenter,\nl38 S.

Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order.

Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def.

The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the protective order, that\nprotective order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb.

(See, e.g., Ex. lo at\n92:2o-93:6). Giuffre moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual situation with the\noffer of a job making money as a massage therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot.

The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®” (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\n<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?!

We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe MDC leter, dated April 28, 2o2l, submited in response to the Court’s memo-\nendorsed order to shou cause (Dkt. 249), fails to address the concerns raised in my April 26\"\nleter. The Court should summarily deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the\nspecifics in the Court’s order.\n\nThe claim that “[d]Juring Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted she was in receipt of\ndocuments that were handed to her by the atorneys” does not justify the confiscation and review\nof Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell was in\nreceipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did not hand to\nMs. Maxwell any documents that did not originate from Ms. Maxwell. Further, it was after Ms.\nMaxwell called counsel to report that her documents were seized and counsel, in turn, informed\nMs. Maxwell that a complaint would be made that MDC staff contacted legal counsel.\n\nOnce again, the Court is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.\nPapapetru was not present during the legal visit, does not claim to have reviewed the video\nrecording of the legal visit, and failed to provide any helpful or reliable information (either by\nway of an affidavit or declaration or a copy of the recording) to rebut the claims before the\nCourt. A recycled reporting of the guards’ inaccurate observation is an inadequate response to a\nsignificant problem. The MDC has failed to offer any <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>, fact-based explanation for\nviolation of Ms. Maxwell’s 6 Amendment rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s\nresponse and order the relief requested on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nConsidering the MDC’s atempt to cast the conduct of its staff in a positive light while\ncasting aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and counsel, we request that the Court direct that the guards\nresponsible for the inappropriate seizure be summoned to Court and a copy of the video\nrecording be provided to defense counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 349\nSecretary of Labor. Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l34 of 349\n\nIn another leter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed\ninformation about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil\nlitigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.””’ Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\n\nl66 Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nl67 Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo443l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\n<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27l of 349\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**?

As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004939.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l6 of 27\nTo Be Filed Under Seal\n(E.D.N.Y.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of54\nvalue of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the Government\nand risk of distracting the jury or encouraging jury nullification. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o3.\nThe Court should therefore preclude evidence or argument regarding the Government’s supposed\nmotives for prosecution, including evidence of Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of\ncharges against the defendant.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that claims of purported government misconduct must\nbe “directed to the court rather than jury.” United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir.\nl997). Allegations concerning the government’s conduct are “ultimately separate from the issue\nof [a defendant’s] factual guilt” and concern an alleged “defect in the institution of the\nprosecution.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, district courts routinely and\ncorrectly preclude defendants from raising these arguments at trial. See id. (“[W]e agree with the\ndistrict court’s decision to resolve for itself whether the government’s conduct was lawful and to\nprevent Regan from presenting evidence on that subject.”); United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr.\n7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2oo4) (granting motion to preclude the\ndefendant from “presenting arguments or evidence that would invite the jury to question the\nGovernment’s motives in investigating and indicting” the defendant), aff'd and remanded, 433\nF.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThis extends to claims challenging the motives of a prosecution. In general, “the decision\nas to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad discretion of the prosecutor, and a\nprosecutor’s pretrial charging decision is presumed <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>.” United States v. Sanders, 2ll\nF.3d 7ll, 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (citations and internal quotation marks omited); see United States\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5428\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw elsewhere tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet proffered.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\nRelevance of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and relevance of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA. “The Tre Purpose 6f & MOuoo. 7 Firs ons omen aoe cem ermrmaemmen asemc,\nB.

Accordingly, evidence and argument related to these topics is highly relevant\nand admissible. See id. at 445-49; Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. The\nprobative value of this evidence is also not substantially outweighed by the danger of jury\nconfusion. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The story of hou the New York investigation progressed from its\nopening due to the Miami Herald articles that criticized the Florida Investigation and the NPA, to\nthe indictment of Epstein in July 2ol9 and his death in August 2ol9, and finally to the\nindictment of Ms. Maxwell in June 2o2o is simple and straightforward. The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o. See Mot. at 27-\n28. That is not hard to follou.” Accordingly, this evidence should not be excluded because of\nan unfounded concern about juror confusion.”*\n>? Tt is particularly hypocritical of the government to argue that a discussion of the various investigations\nwould create an “extensive side-shou” because the investigations “reach[] back 2o years.” Mot. at 27. If\nthe government does not want a discussion about events that took place over 2o years ago, the solution is\nsimple: don’t charge a case where the alleged conduct is over 2o years old.\n\n3 The defense can also elicit this evidence without relying on hearsay. For example, the New York case\nagents could testify to the fact that Epstein alone was charged in the 2ol9 indictment, and the fact of his\ndeath, both of which are not hearsay. Moreover, we do not intend to ask the New York case agents why\nMs. Maxwell was not charged in the 2ol9 indictment. It is premature, houever, to litigate any hearsay\nissues at this stage. Those issues should await trial.\na3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 6o of 69\n\ne the Indictment charged a conspiracy between Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell during a\ndiscrete time period;\n\ne the charged conspiracy encompasses females other than the four specified Accusers;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will be to shou both an agreement between Mr. Epstein\nand Ms. Maxwell to accomplish the specified illegal objectives;\n\ne the government's burden at trial will also encompass proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Ms. Maxwell had knouledge of the conspiracies’ illegal objectives.\n\nThus, evidence that Jeffrey Epstein acted alone, or with other co-conspirators, without the\nknouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell may be admissible as direct evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell's lack of awareness of or participation in the charged conspiracies.

The Court must decide whether to protect the\nprivacy of four victims who will testify in a criminal trial, for the first time in their lives, about the\npainful details of the sexual abuse they were subjected to as children.

The defendant knous who the Minor Victims\nand other witnesses are and has conducted a fulsome investigation, as shoun by the defendant’s\nbrief in opposition. And the jury, which will also knou the true names of the Minor Victims, will\nfully understand whatever information the defense elicits on cross-examination or at trial.

The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005683.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel9of 2l\nactivity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting instruction containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\ninstruction. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,\nthere exists a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5683\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 39o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofil\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this Motion in Limine to Exclude\nGovernment Exhibit 52, an unauthenticated hearsay document from suspect sources, and states\nas follous:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Government has identified, as Exhibit 52, A-F, pages of an often photocopied and\naltered exhibit that has no identified author, date of creation, or custodian.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the child, clothing the\nchild, sleeping with the child, the adult being in underwear around the\nchild, the adult acting like a child, or the adult sharing private information\nwith the child, particularly sexual or relationship information (e.g., “my\nwife and I are not having sex”). Again, for parents, family members or\ncaregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation\nthan for others.\nlo. Asking the child to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g.,\nthe mother’s Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic\nsecret, whereas asking the child to not tell that she was with the offender\nwould be).\nll. Providing the child drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is\nalready abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be consid-\nered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate\ncompliance with the intended sexual abuse).\nl2. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly\nwhen these relate to adult—child sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.\nl3. Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the child (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3.

The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply irrelevant—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006272.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4 of 29\n98 J.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury. As such, courts in this Circuit have repeatedly precluded evidence\nof charging decisions for one or more of these reasons. See, e.g., United States v. Borrero, No.\nl3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. l, 2ol3) (precluding cross\nexamination regarding a government charging decision in part because “the limited amount of\nprobative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially outweighed by the risk of\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006395.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of54\nvalue of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the Government\nand risk of distracting the jury or encouraging jury nullification. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o3.\nThe Court should therefore preclude evidence or argument regarding the Government’s supposed\nmotives for prosecution, including evidence of Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of\ncharges against the defendant.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that claims of purported government misconduct must\nbe “directed to the court rather than jury.” United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir.\nl997). Allegations concerning the government’s conduct are “ultimately separate from the issue\nof [a defendant’s] factual guilt” and concern an alleged “defect in the institution of the\nprosecution.” /d. (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, district courts routinely and\ncorrectly preclude defendants from raising these arguments at trial. See id. (“[W]e agree with the\ndistrict court’s decision to resolve for itself whether the government’s conduct was lawful and to\nprevent Regan from presenting evidence on that subject.”); United States v. Stewart, No. o3 Cr.\n7l7 (MGC), 2oo4 WL ll35o6, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2oo4) (granting motion to preclude the\ndefendant from “presenting arguments or evidence that would invite the jury to question the\nGovernment’s motives in investigating and indicting” the defendant), aff'd and remanded, 433\nF.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThis extends to claims challenging the motives of a prosecution. In general, “the decision\nas to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad discretion of the prosecutor, and a\nprosecutor’s pretrial charging decision is presumed <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>.” United States v. Sanders, 2ll\nF.3d 7ll, 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (citations and internal quotation marks omited); see United States\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 54\n\non the victims for participating in the defendant’s crimes, embarrassing the victims and inviting\nthe jury to engage in stereotyping and nullification. These are precisely the forms of harm the\nlaw elsewhere tries to mitigate. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 & Advisory Commitee Note (restricting\nintroduction of evidence of a victim’s other sexual behavior to encourage victims to come\nforward and avoid “invasion of privacy, potential embossment and sexual stereotyping”); l8\nU.S.C. § 377l(a)(8) (giving victims the right to be treated with “respect for the victim’s dignity\nand privacy”). The probative value of such evidence is therefore significantly outweighed by the\ndanger of prejudice.\n\nThe Court should permit evidence of a minor victim’s consent to engage in sexual\nactivity only if doing so would aid the jury to evaluate a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> defense theory, which the\ndefense has not yet proffered.\n\nVII. Before Offering Evidence or Argument of the Defendant’s Failure to Commit\nOther Bad Acts, the Court Should Require the Defense to Proffer the Basis and\nRelevance of Such Evidence\n\nThe defense has repeatedly suggested that any witness who did not observe the defendant\nparticipating in criminal conduct is exculpatory evidence. Specific-act propensity evidence is no\nmore admissible to refute a criminal charge than it is to establish one. Accordingly, before the\nCourt permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes that did not\ninvolve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and relevance of\nthat evidence.\n\n“No less than evidence of a defendant’s prior ‘bad acts’ used to shou that he commited\nthe crime charged, . . . ‘good acts’ evidence is only relevant if we assume that a defendant acted\nin conformity with those prior good acts—i.e., if we make the exact propensity inference Rule\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 69\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA. “The Tre Purpose 6f & MOuoo. 7 Firs ons omen aoe cem ermrmaemmen asemc,\nB.

The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o.

The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.).

They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times.

That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell\nbased on a false assumption.\n\nFinally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that\nthe jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as\nimproper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is alloued to testify that she engaged in sex acts\nwith Epstein in London when she was l7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost\ncertainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and\nthat the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual\nactivity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is alloued to testify, we request that the Court\ngive the jury a limiting instruction containing the follouing points:\n\ne The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom\nis l6 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from l994-\nl995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey\nEpstein in London when she was l7 years old.\n\ne The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony\nwas therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,\nI instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”\nor “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in\nthe indictment.\n\nIf the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admited as 4o4(b) evidence,\nMs. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity\ninstruction. See Dolney, 2oo5 WL 2l29l69, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,\nthere exists a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if\nthe defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at\nissue in these charges must also be criminal.”).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006654.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 445 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofll\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this Motion in Limine to Exclude\nGovernment Exhibit 52, an unauthenticated hearsay document from suspect sources, and states\nas follous:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Government has identified, as Exhibit 52, A-F, pages of an often photocopied and\naltered exhibit that has no identified author, date of creation, or custodian.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page lo of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 965\ntalking, giving special atention, trying to get the child to initiate contact with\nme. Get the child to feel safe to talk with me” (p. 297).\n\nIn his literature review on teacher sexual misconduct, Knoll (2olo)\nfound that educator sexual offenders tend to use bribery by giving their\nstudents special atention or rewards. According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it difficult for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l5 of 43\n97o N.

Repeated violations of the child’s privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom\nwhen child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likelihood the individual’s\nbehavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it\nmay be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming\nbehaviors that may be misinterpreted:\nl. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the child (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3.

(The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8. But if that’s so, then there’s\nno probative value to the unauthenticated photographs, particular when, as the Court\nacknouledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence.

Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victims’ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendant’s approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating privileged, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-client relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI.

Cf, e.g., l At’y-Client Privilege in the U.S. § 3:24 (2o2l)\n(“Although atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient relationship. ‘The serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.””); United States v.

Juror 5o further desires\nto maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his\nexperience as the victim of prior sexual assault.\nTW. ARGUMENT\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should, in its proper exercise of discretion,\nallou Juror 5o to intervene in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury\nQuestionnaire to his atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have\ncompelling and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including\nprior sexual assaults. Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater.

Additionally, allouing Juror 5o to intervene will\nassist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry into the subject, by\nallouing his an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant issues. Moreover,\nthe interests of justice and judicial economy will be served if Juror 5o is permited to intervene at\nthis point in time, as the same will allou Juror 5o to identify and assert any fifth amendment\nrights against self-incrimination before any hearing is held pursuant to an inquiry directed by the\nCourt.\nA. Juror 5o’s Request to Intervene\nl. Jurors have compelling and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> privacy rights.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has explicitly acknouledged that Jurors can have\n“compelling” and “<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>” privacy interests that warrants sealing the record as to certain\nstatements given by the jurors. Press-Enter. Co. v Superior Ct. of California, Riverside County,\n464 US 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984)-. In Press-Enter. Co., the Supreme Court expressly determined that\nforcing an individual to disclose details of a sexual assault may justify holding closed hearings\nand sealing the record due to “the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very disclosure\nof the episode”. /d. In Press-Enter. Co., Chief Justice Burger further made clear that forced\ndisclosure of past sexual assault suffered by jurors gave rise to a “valid privacy right”. /d.\n\nIn United States v. King, the Second Circuit upheld the ruling by the louer court, which\nalloued parts of the record in that case to be sealed based on the jurors’ privacy interest in\nintensely personal subjects, as well as upheld the louer court’s finding that such interest was\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny King atracted from the press.

See Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. It should go without saying\nthat Juror 5o needs to knou whether or not the question(s) related to prior sexual abuse were\nanswered by him correctly on his Jury Questionnaire to help determine what an appropriate\ninquiry would entail, so that the same would also Juror 5o’s privacy rights and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\ninterests related to these maters.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 38 of 66\ndefense based on having suffered domestic violence at the hands of the victim, that a\njuror living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial, and who gave\ndishonest answers regarding that subject at voir dire, was impliedly biased); United\nStates v.

The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant.

It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion.

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

Probation\nidentifies two groups of potential offenders who will purportedly be deterred from commiting\nfuture crimes as a result of Ms. Maxwell’s sentence: (l) sexual predators who exploit and degrade\nminor victims and (2) “untouchable individuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them\nto victimize others without fear or consequence.” PSR at 67. With regard to the first group, courts\nhave expressed <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> doubt as to whether people who have a sexual predilection for minors\ncan be deterred at all. See, e.g., United States v. D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol3)\n(“[T]he compulsive behavior and disorders motivating many offenders is less susceptible to\ngeneral deterrence.”). With regard to the second group, the purported justification sweeps far too\nbroadly. Rather than identify a particular class of similarly situated defendants who will be\ndeterred from commiting specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion that\na harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is necessary to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.\nSee PSR at 67. That is not the purpose of general deterrence and should not be given any weight\nin determining the appropriate sentence.\nA Belou Guidelines Sentence Would Provide Just Punishment, Promote Respect for the\nLaw, and Avoid Unwarranted Sentencing Disparities\n\nWhile the offense conduct is indisputably serious, the record reflects that Epstein was the\nmain offender. Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell\nbest serves the long-term goals of punishment. A significantly belou-guidelines sentence in this\ncase would also promote respect for the law by demonstrating that the justice system considers\neach person who comes before the Court as an individual. A sentence tailored to Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s particular circumstances—would appropriately distinguish between this defendant and\nmore culpable individuals similarly charged. See United States v.

When the bright lights were turned off in her cell, bright lights remained on\ndirectly outside her cell; and the flashlight checks continued, a regime completely inappropriate\nfor a non-suicidal inmate.

She was unnecessarily exposed to radiation from body scanners; and was\nfortunate not to contract COVID when guards, who were not required to take COVID tests, looked\nand searched inside her mouth. Her cell was searched multiple times daily. The searches were\nredundant, unreasonable, unnecessary, and abusive beyond any <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> penological purpose,\nespecially where Ms. Maxwell had no opportunity to acquire contraband. See Hodges v. Stanley,\n7l2 F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. l983). At times, searches were conducted in inappropriate ways and\nwere especially painful humiliating and intimidating, as when her breasts and genitalia were\ntouched in a rough and reckless manner. Reports by Ms. Maxwell and counsel concerning sexually\ninappropriate searches by corrections officers went nouhere.\n\nIt is clearly established that excessive searches are unnecessary and unreasonable when a\nprisoner is isolated from other inmates and never out of range of the camera or a guard. Ms.\nMaxwell was searched every time she was removed from or returned to her isolation cell, even\nwhen she had no conceivable opportunity (let alone no intention) to obtain contraband. Clearly,\nthe search policy is one that was not applied consistently.

But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here.

Since\nthen, the public’s interest in the Epstein mater has remained. Given this longstanding and\n<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> interest, the government nou moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with\nEpstein.\n\n2 The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v.

Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o of 246 23l5\nLCGVMAXl\n\nl MS.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail.

Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC.

As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded.

As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

(citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021181.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page9 of 258\nSA-7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 348\nSecretary of Labor.

The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI.

Finally, in a leter to Assistant Atorney General Fisher on\nMay l4, 2oo8, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the\ndefense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkouitz, and Whitley.\n\nMeanwhile, Oosterban’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision leter to be sent from Oosterban\nto Lefkouitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker and Assistant Atorney General Fisher, as well as\nthe Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of\nEnforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterban told OPR that, notwithstanding\nthe defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited\nto determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.\n\nOosterban’s leter, sent to Lefkouitz on May l5, 2oo8, notified the defense team that\nCEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal\ncriminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The leter specified\nthat CEOS’s review addressed the “narrou question” of whether a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> basis existed for a\nfederal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues\nrelating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA\nor the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The leter stated that based on its examination of the\nmaterial relevant to its limited review of the mater, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution\nin this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his\ndiscretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”\n\nOn May l9, 2oo8, Lefkouitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically\nasked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.” Lefkouitz made several points in support\nof the request for a meeting: (l) CEOS’s leter acknouledged that federal prosecution of Epstein\nwould involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;!°° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that\nfederal prosecution would not be ‘“‘an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the\ncase;!®’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical\nnew evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that\nrepresented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the leter that Sloman’s past association with the\natorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.\ntes Oosterban’s leter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution\neven though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument\nbased on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult\nprostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterban stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly\nfocused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults\nthrough force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look\nprecisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”\n\nEst Oosterban began his leter, houever, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrou question as\nto whether there is a <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> basis for the U.S. Atorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of\nMr. Epstein.”\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\n<span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span> interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and <span class=\"highlight\">legitimate</span>\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021446.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o39, Pagel6 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies.
