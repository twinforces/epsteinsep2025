This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that\nshe and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant’s trafficking of minors by, among\nother things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his\nresidences in Manhatan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured\nprominently in the Herald series.\nII. Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000470.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB_ Document 3o Filed o7/l7/l9 Page lofl\n.)

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to briefly respond to one aspect of the\ndefendant’s July l6, 2ol9 leter (ECF No. 24), and to provide the Court with additional information\nregarding the defendant’s foreign passport. The defendant’s July l6, 2ol9 leter asserts: “[A]s for\nthe Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years ago. And the government offers\nnothing to suggest—and certainly no evidence—that Epstein ever used it.” (ECF No. 24 at 7).

The Government Should Not Be Permited to Introduce Evidence of Alleged\n“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After Epstein’s Death Is Proof of\nConsciousness of Guilt\nThe government cannot establish a satisfactory factual predicate for the jury to infer that\n\nMs. Maxwell was, in fact, fleeing or evading law enforcement authorities after the arrest of\n\nJeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct is proof of consciousness of guilt. The reason is simple —\n\nthose inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell never once left\n\nthe country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was\nplanning to flee, despite having received a grand jury subpoena and knouing that she was\nconsidered a subject of the ongoing FBI investigation. Instead, she found a <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> residence\nclose to New York where she stayed continuously for seven months before her arrest and\nremained in regular contact with the prosecutors through her atorneys. As previously discussed,\n\nMs. Maxwell also addressed and rebuted each point that the government referenced in its bail\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5696", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l6 of 375\nELIZABETH F.

And then there\nwas just a giant black massage table in the middle of it.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o).

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d).

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032095.jpg": "Trilateral Commission Members Page 3 of 9\nInc.; George F Baker Professor of Economics, Harvard University; former\nChairman, President's Council of Economic Advisors\nStanley Fischer, First Deputy Managing Director International Monetary\nFund\nGeorge M.

Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\n‘a l96\ncrime,\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “‘on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023466.tif": "resulted in Epstein being housed without a cellmate at the time of his death, which was contrary to the\nPsychology Department's directive issued just lo days earlier.\nBOP standards of conduct require that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”©' MCC\nNew York Post Orders for the SHU require, among other things, that all SHU officers “maintain a log of\npertinent information regarding inmate activity, detailing time, persons involved (if pertinent) and the event,\nwhich must be logged into TRUSCOPE.”® Importantly, the SHU Post Orders clarify that they “are not\nintended to describe in detail all the officer's responsibilities. Good judgment and common sense are\nexpected in all situations not covered in these post orders.”\nOn August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and CO\nTova Noel were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their <span class=\"highlight\">permanent</span> quarterly assigned post and\nserved as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts. The OIG investigation found that each\nof these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology\nDepartment's directive.\nThe OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s\ncellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status knoun to all\nMCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the\ninstitution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and CO l, who was also assigned to the SHU, reviewed the MCC New York daily call out list,\na document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, which listed Inmate 3\nas being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings. At approximately 8:3o a.m., CO l\nescorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the\nDay Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for his\ndaily meeting with his atorneys. During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO l\ndiscussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer. The Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared follouing Epstein’s death,\nthat he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new\ncellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant. Houever, the OIG did not credit the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in\nfact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.\n6 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n62 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n& Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9.\n6 Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave\nthe facility.\n6 The OIG did not find that CO l failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-\nof-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\n\n99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023842.tif": "i ee\n\nU.S Department of Justice Certification of Identity a,\n\nFORM APPROVED OMB NO. llo2-ool6\n\nEXPIRES l3l/l3\nee\nPrivacy Act Statement, In accordance with 28 CFR Section l6.4l(d) personal dita sufficient to identify the individuals submiting requests by\nmail under the Privacy Act of l974, 5 LS.C.
