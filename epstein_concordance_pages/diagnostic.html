Like\nthe government’s motions here, where a party “endeavor{[s] to strike in shotgun fashion at whole\ntopics and sources of prospective evidence, out of context and before any specific objection\nagainst its proper backdrop is raised...,” the strategy is “impermissible” and the motions should\nbe denied.

These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd.

Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: <span class=\"highlight\">Diagnostic</span> criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the <span class=\"highlight\">Diagnostic</span>\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J.

In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” <span class=\"highlight\">Diagnostic</span> criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Diagnostic</span> criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway.

Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\n<span class=\"highlight\">diagnostic</span> criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 29\nllo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nWhen parsing these domains, it can be more clearly seen hou BPD may\nserve as a pathway for false allegations of sexual assault. The first domain\n(Leib et al., 2oo4) includes the <span class=\"highlight\">diagnostic</span> criterion of quickly switching from\nidealization to devaluation of relationship (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD\nmay be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant\nothers or lovers to devaluing them (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\nThis sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feel-\ning that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion\nof abandonment. The rapid shifting between idealizing and demonization\nmay bring about a change in perspective such that a relationship that was\nviewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse”\nand may lead a person with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual\nassault.\n\nAs Kanin (l994) found in his longitudinal study, two of the three major\nmotivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship\nand/or relationship partner (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) may\nspur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devalua-\ntion phase, newly construed as mistreatment. In addition an individual with\nBPD who is feeling fear of abandonment may seek frantically to achieve the\natention that is craved from the partner who is perceived to be neglectful\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). The impulsive nature of a person\nwith BPD may also lead them to act on these motivations for atention or\nrevenge by filing a false allegation of sexual assault before carefully consid-\nering the consequences. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with\nBPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative” (Linehan, l993).\nManipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the\nindividual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation\nfrequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an indi-\nvidual with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting\na third party for some desired outcome.\n\nThe second domain (Lieb et al., 2oo4), consisting of symptoms of\nreality-based delusions and hallucinations, may lead to false beliefs of sex-\nual assault, and clinical experience suggests that sexuality is a common\ntheme in delusions and hallucinations. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric\nAssociation 2ooo, p. 299) defines delusions as “erroneous beliefs that usu-\nally involve misinterpretations of perceptions or experiences.” Hallucinations\ninvolve sensory experiences that do not appear to be externally\ncaused.\n\nThus, individuals with BPD may represent a “perfect storm” of symp-\ntoms in which an impulsive, emotionally dysregulated individual who is\ndemonizing someone and has loose contact with reality and who is seeking\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">diagnostic</span> criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary <span class=\"highlight\">diagnostic</span> criteria of interest in this pathway are <span class=\"highlight\">diagnostic</span>\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 29\nll8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Diagnostic</span> and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: <span class=\"highlight\">Diagnostic</span> criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.

Any of these mental\ndisorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect\nmemory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVarying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions\nof victims follouing sexual assault and last for varying durations.

A substantial number of people never fully remit\nfrom their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit\nfrom an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood\ntrauma.
