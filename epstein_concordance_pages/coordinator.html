She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6.

Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> and reported back that that the work release <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they .. . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “‘adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 348\n\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\n\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\n\nfor federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\n\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [professional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ... [I]f there was something... relevant [that] came up pertaining to the\ninvestigation, or something that I thought was noteworthy . . . I might have [recorded it in an interview report].”\n\n3o4 Within limitations set by the Federal Rules of Evidence, a defendant may atack the credibility of a witness\nthrough evidence of bias, which may include the witness having received money, or expecting to receive money, from\nthe government, the defendant, or other sources as a result of the witness’s allegations or testimony.\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 276 of 348\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> or specialist and other key officials.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l42 of 349\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> and reported back that that the work release <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit identified concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview.

August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 226 of 349\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?7”\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafaia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4523\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004533.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 236 of 349\n\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\n\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\n\nfor federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet\n\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\n\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [professional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\no8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ... [I]f there was something. . . relevant [that] came up pertaining to the\ninvestigation, or something that I thought was noteworthy . . . I might have [recorded it in an interview report].”\n\n3o4 Within limitations set by the Federal Rules of Evidence, a defendant may atack the credibility of a witness\nthrough evidence of bias, which may include the witness having received money, or expecting to receive money, from\nthe government, the defendant, or other sources as a result of the witness’s allegations or testimony.\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4533\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 277 of 349\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> or specialist and other key officials.

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, identified the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (‘the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.* Villafafia\nleft the USAO in August 2ol9 to join another federal government agency.\n\nThe follouing chart shous the USAO positions filled by the subjects, or other USAO\npersonnel, during the period of the Epstein investigation.\n\n2 Project Safe Childhood is a nationwide initiative launched by the Department in May 2oo6 to combat the\ngrouing epidemic of technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the U.S. Atorneys’ Offices\nand CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute\nindividuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.\n\n3 After the district court issued its February 2l, 2ol9 opinion finding misconduct on the part of the government,\nthe Department re-assigned the CVRA case to the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021315.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAT 3536o38, Pagel43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> and reported back that that the work release <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 355 3536o38, Page227 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 225 of 348\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.””> Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing of a criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially recetving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naes Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n2m Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021409.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 335 3536o38, Page237 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 235 of 348\nDuring this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\nfor federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet\nor confer with the prosecuting atorneys about any potential federal\n\ndeal that related to me or the crimes commited against me.\n\nMy understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal\ninvestigation would continue. I also understood that my oun case\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\n\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [p]rofessional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°%\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. Ina leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.° The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial... . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n2o8 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.*'° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.‘! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\nao The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n4d The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.”\nae Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation.

Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case.

Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> and reported back that that the work release <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.'*?

The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na7 US.

The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n27 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023237.tif": "questions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia directed\nthe FBI case agents to hand deliver the leters “as they were conducting interviews.” Villafafia\ntold OPR that the USAO had “no standardized way to do any victim notifications prior to” the\nfiling of federal charges, and therefore Villafafia did not use a template or VNS-generated leter\nfor content, but instead used a leter she “had created and crafted [herself] for another case.”?”’\n\nThe leters contained contact information for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, and the\nDepartment’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.\nThe USAO leters described the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be\nnotified “[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.” The leters stated that, in\naddition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and\npotential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a\nlist of counseling and medical services.*’* Lastly, the leters advised that investigators for the\ndefense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact\nVillafafia or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO leters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-\narrest or indictment stage, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters to activate the\nUSAO’s CVRA obligations, which she believed atached only after the filing ofa criminal charge.\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI leter and\na USAO leter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO leter “was coming\nwith an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].” Later, in the course of\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the investigative team “adopted an approach of\nproviding more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even\nbefore the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging\ndecisions had been made.”?”\n\nVillafafia informed Lourie and Sloman about the leters, but the leters were not reviewed\nby any of Villafafia’s supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management\ntask. Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n278 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023238.tif": "[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023247.tif": "During this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement\nhad already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein\nfor federal charges against me.

I also understood that my oun case\nwould move forward touards prosecution of Epstein.\n\nIn addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to\nVillafafia in an email:\n\nJane Doe #l4 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]\n\njail sentence and Jane Doe #l3 has asked for our Victim Witness\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span> to get in touch with her so she can receive some much\n\nneeded [p]rofessional counseling. Other than that, their response\n\nwas filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for\n\npursuing justice and not giving up.°°?\nThe case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and\nexpressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #l3” told OPR that while his client recalled\nmeeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about\nEpstein’s guilty plea. In a leter to OPR, “Jane Doe #l4’s” atorney stated that although her client\nrecalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein\nwould not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.\n\nAfter meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if\nEpstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’\nknouledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*°* The\ncase agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the\ndamages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]\nMr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these\ngirls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think\nit was right.”\n\nSimilarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]\nand said we’re not comfortable nou puting this out there... because . . . it’s likely that [the case\nagent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”\nVillafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe\n3o3 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an\ninterview of them, it was a notification. ...

The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Leters Sent by the\n\nFBI in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and May 2oo8 Describing the Status of\nthe Case as “Under Investigation”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines charged the FBI with informing the victims of CVRA rights and\navailable services during the “investigative stage” of a case. During the Epstein investigation, the\nFBI case agents complied with the agency’s notification obligation by hand delivering pamphlets\nto victims follouing their interviews and through computer-generated leters sent to the victims by\nthe FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. The\nUSAO has its oun Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for victim\nnotification after an indictment or complaint moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”\n\nThe FBI’s Victim Specialist used the VNS to prepare the October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8 leters, a system the FBI regularly employs to comply with its obligations under the\n2oo5 Guidelines to inform the victims of their rights and other services during the “investigative\nstage.” The stock language of that leter, houever, was generic and failed to communicate the\nunique case-specific status of the Epstein investigation at that time. The FBI Victim Specialist\nwho sent the leters acted at the case agent’s direction and was not aware of the existence of the\nNPA at the time she created the leters.4!° Neither FBI case agent reviewed any of the leters sent\nby the FBI’s Victim Specialist.*!! According to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the leters and\nthe wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents\ninformed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent her “standard form leter,”\nVillafafia had never reviewed an FBI-generated victim notification leter and was not aware of its\ncontents.*!? Villafafia told OPR she was unaware of the content of the FBI leters until they were\ncollected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after July 2oo8.\n\n4lo The case agent told OPR that she did not recall specifically directing the Victim Specialist to send a leter,\nbut acknouledged that “she would come to us before she would approach a victim.”\n\naul The case agent told OPR that she had no role in drafting the leters and believed them to be “standard form\nleters.” Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “I can’t think that I’ve ever reviewed any of them . . . they just go\nfrom the victim <span class=\"highlight\">coordinator</span>.”\n\nale Villafafia’s lack of familiarity with the language in the FBI leters led to some inconsistency in the\ninformation provided to victims concerning their CVRA rights. Beginning in 2oo6, the FBI provided to victims\nstandard leters advising victims of their CVRA rights but which also noted that only some of the rights applied\npre-charge. During this period, Villafafia also crafted her oun introductory leters to the victims to let them knou of\ntheir CVRA rights and that the federal investigation “would be a different process” from the prior state investigation\nin which “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated by the State Atorney’s Office.” Villafafia told\nOPR that in a case in which she “need[ed] to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nquestions,” she wanted to “make sure that they . . . feel like they can trust me.” Villafafia’s leter itemized the CVRA\nrights, but it did not explain that those rights atached only after a formal charge had been made.

On August 2, 2ol9, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2ol9,\nincident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself\nor that he had been harmed by his cellmate.\n24 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9.\n5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.\n\n3l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023409.tif": "Psychologist l noted that during Physician Assistant l’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,\nEpstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.\nAdditionally, Forensic Psychologist l noted no suicidal ideations, atempts, or self-harm; no history of\nsubstance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.\nDuring the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”\nand that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span> from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements.

She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with\nEpstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the atorney conference area for a psychological\nobservation follou-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department.

Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention <span class=\"highlight\">Coordinator</span>, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.

Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records.

This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\n\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24942\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024944.jpg": "Page 485\nInstitutional History: On July 6, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in\nNew Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMRP Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed.

He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to\ntolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\nl.

P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern.

There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log\nbook writen by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch.

This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\n\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report.

He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to\ntolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\nl.

All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the\nreconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern. For example, there were two concurrently open atorney log books in the\nAtorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two atorney log books, one\nin the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\nreconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior.

A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2.
