Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001225.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 42243o) 26a geageol 6 Gb 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001226.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a Geapeol 7l G5 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001307.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 22, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o68583, Page‘ of 2\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nDEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON CATHERINE O'HAGAN WOLFE\nCHIEF JUDGE CLERK OF COURT\nDate: April ol, 2o2l DC Docket #: l:2o-cr-33o-l\nDocket #: 2l-58 DC Court: SDNY (NEW YORK\nShort Title: United States of America v.

(/d. at l5).\nJudge Nathan highlighted that in July 2o2o Maxwell represented to Pretrial Services\nthat she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection with her renewed\nrequest for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth of\nMaxwell and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o. (/d.\nat l5). Judge Nathan found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the\nmisrepresentation was the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than\nmisdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). She explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything,\n\nstronger nou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court\n\nthat the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial Services\n\nwere woefully <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>.

Judge Nathan again concluded that Maxwell presented a risk of\nflight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her\nappearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained millions of dollars and other assets that\nshe could sell in order to support herself’ and the “proposed bond is only partially\nsecured.” (/d. at l6-l8). Judge Nathan explained that the pledge of several third\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001447.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page/7 of 24\n\nl3. Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex. H at l-2). Among other things,\nJudge Nathan concluded that the case against Maxwell “remains strong” in light of\nthe Government’s proffer of evidence. (/d. at lo). Judge Nathan further found\nthat Maxwell still had “substantial international ties,” “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “extraordinary\nfinancial resources” that would still “provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics. (/d. at l5). Judge Nathan therefore again concluded that Maxwell\npresented a risk of flight and that Maxwell’s proposed bail package “cannot\nreasonably assure her appearance.” (/d. at l6).

Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page l of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2247", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l6 of 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l7 of 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86-87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 3o\nor Hispanics or fewer.

None of these persons responded to the\nquestionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\nqualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\nqualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\nestimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\nqualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 percentage points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo percentage points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified\njury wheel and the community.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 3o\nApp.-o8l9\nl.5\nG4LMGIUC\n\nl her story consistent with her previous stories.

Instead of two\nalleged “victims,” the indictment here has different categories with three people being identified\nas “Minor Victims,” even though they are not minors. Additionally, an unknoun number of\nunexplained categories of unidentified human beings appear in the Indictment: “multiple minor\ngirls,” “victims,” “minor victims,” “minor victims described herein,” “some of Epstein’s minor\nvictims,” and “multiple minor victims.” It is a mystery if the government claims that these\nalleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or surplusage. Multiple “among other\nthing” and “means and methods” alleged acts are bandied about in the indictment such as:\nassisted, facilitated, contributed, recruit, groom, befriend, spending time, being present, help, etc.\nThis Indictment is subject to considerable interpretation and manipulation. Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare a defense without knouing who her accusers are and whether they are limited to the\nalleged “Minor Victims” or the rest of the universe.\n\n“Second,” the government relies on the general proposition that “Courts in the Second\nCircuit have consistently upheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific\ndate.” Resp. at l54.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25.

It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements.

Fear of repercussions for reporting—as\ncaregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,\n2oo3). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual\nassault is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,\nJoyce (2oo3) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-\ntant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get\ninto trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it\ncan be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual\nassault for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6289", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\n<span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008955.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3l of 37\n\nA. Flight Records — Passenger Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal\nsexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the\njury to assess the accuracy of the witness’ recollections of events that had occurred over 2o years\nago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than l7 years old\nfor the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a passenger on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the passenger manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\nrecollection of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\ncommercial plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349.

We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\ndisclosure of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud.

The reputational harm from\nreleasing <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>, potentially misleading grand jury testimony, untested by cross-\nexamination, would be severe and irrevocable. Those allegations, if released in raw,\nuntested form, would inevitably influence any future legal proceeding should\nMaxwell succeed in her post-conviction litigation. The government's proposal to\n“redact victim-identifying information” does not mitigate this harm. The substance\nof the allegations, not the names, creates the prejudice.

Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020143.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pad ef Goof 22\nwas the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the\nDefendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish\nany explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services\nand, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger\nnou than in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s representations to Pretrial\nServices were woefully <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to\nwhether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the\nDefendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh\nin favor of detention.\n\nC. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nIn light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of\npersuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3l42(g) factors into\naccount, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and\ncharacteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and\ncharacteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the\nGovernment has also shoun, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined belou, that the\nDefendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s\noriginal conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can\nreasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered.\n\nAs already noted, the Defendant nou proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which\nincludes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020144.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag Pagefl Tost 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020225.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 4l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o68583, Pagel of 2\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nDEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON CATHERINE O'HAGAN WOLFE\nCHIEF JUDGE CLERK OF COURT\nDate: April ol, 2o2l DC Docket #: l:2o-cr-33o-l\nDocket #: 2l-58 DC Court: SDNY (NEW YORK\nShort Title: United States of America v.

Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.”).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v.

Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained.

It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein’s death], but we\ndon't, we will never knou.”\nV. Failure to Conduct SHU Inmate Counts and Staff Rounds on August 9--lo\nA. SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified. As a\n5 This BOP form is officially entitled “Metropolitan Correctional Center; New York, New York; Official Count Slip.”\n6l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23428", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span> compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024828.jpg": "Page 29o\n(i a Risk of Sexual Abusiveness document on July 8, 2ol9.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave <span class=\"highlight\">incomplete</span>\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033208.tif": "; LAW OFFICES OF\nGERALD B.
