The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> works or evidence of her family history. Such\nevidence should be excluded as irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial.\n\nAs discussed above, the Federal Rules of Evidence preclude the use of good acts to draw\na propensity inference in favor of the defendant, just as they preclude the use of prior bad acts for\nthe same purpose. See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF. App’x 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (“The district court correctly recognized that\nevidence of solitary confinement could be used for the improper purpose of provoking juror\nsympathy.”). Any atempt to encourage such sympathy is therefore an atempt at nullification,\nwhich is itself plainly improper. See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l5 (2d Cir.\nl997) (Jury nullification is “by no means a right or something that a judge should encourage or\npermit if it is within his authority to prevent.”); id. at 6l4 (“We categorically reject the idea that,\nin a society commited to the rule of law, jury nullification is desirable or that courts may permit\nit to occur when it is within their authority to prevent.”); see also United States v. Washington,\n7o5 F.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir. l983) (per curiam) (“A jury has no more ‘right’ to find a ‘guilty’\ndefendant ‘not guilty’ than it has to find a ‘not guilty’ defendant ‘guilty,’ and the fact that the\nformer cannot be corrected by a court, while the later can be, does not create a right out of the\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo544l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 54\npouer to misapply the law. Such verdicts are lawless, a denial of due process and constitute an\nexercise of erroneously seized pouer.” (emphasis in original)).\n\nEven if a defendant offers character evidence, that evidence may not include specific\ninstances of good conduct, unless the defendant’s character is an “essential element” of the\noffense. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a) & 4o5; see, e.g., United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767, 792 &\nn.77 (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Nachamie, 28 F. App’x l3, 2o-2l (2d Cir. 2ool) (summary\norder). Character evidence is only admissible “by testimony about the person’s reputation or by\ntestimony in the form of an opinion.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o5(a); see, e.g., United States v. Riley, 638\nF. App’x 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (“The limitations imposed by the district court\nfolloued directly from the Rules of Evidence, which permit a defendant to offer evidence of a\npersonal opinion or his reputation for a pertinent character trait, but not to offer testimony\nregarding ‘specific instances’ of conduct in conformity with a trait that is not at issue.” (citations\nomited)).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any relevant reason for the jury to consider the\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> activities, family history, or similar facts. Because those facts have\nnothing to do with her guilt or innocence, and they are not permissible character evidence, she\nshould be precluded from mentioning such subjects in her opening statement, during the\npresentation of evidence, or in closing statements, absent a ruling that a specific fact is relevant\nand more probative than unfairly prejudicial.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position. See Mot. at 43.\nAlthough the Court excluded pre-trial evidence of \"unrelated prior good conduct, i.e., <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span>\ngiving or cooperation with law enforcement,\" it held:\n\nTo the extent that evidence of good conduct is relevant to the charged conduct (i.e.,\n\nto establish an alibi) or may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury, the court\n\nwill consider its introduction at trial. The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any\nsuch evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 64 of 69\nexamples were given, the Court finds that this is too vague a category to grant the relief\nrequested.\").\n\nThe government has not explained why they believe that counsel does not understand\nthese rules or what evidence (beyond \"<span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> works\" or \"evidence of her family history\") that\nthey expect to be offered at trial. If the topic of \"<span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> works\" comes up in the government's\ncase, then topics of Ms. Maxwell's \"<span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> works\" may become relevant. If the topic of Ms.\nMaxwell's family history is elicited or argued by the government, then topics of Ms. Maxwell's\nfamily history may become relevant. One wonders if the government is suggesting these topics\nbecause it intends to try to elicit some testimony on these topics and then preclude Ms. Maxwell\nfrom responding.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> works or evidence of her family history. Such\nevidence should be excluded as irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial.\n\nAs discussed above, the Federal Rules of Evidence preclude the use of good acts to draw\na propensity inference in favor of the defendant, just as they preclude the use of prior bad acts for\nthe same purpose. See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF. App’x 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (“The district court correctly recognized that\nevidence of solitary confinement could be used for the improper purpose of provoking juror\nsympathy.”). Any atempt to encourage such sympathy is therefore an atempt at nullification,\nwhich is itself plainly improper. See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l5 (2d Cir.\nl997) (Jury nullification is “by no means a right or something that a judge should encourage or\npermit if it is within his authority to prevent.”); id. at 6l4 (“We categorically reject the idea that,\nin a society commited to the rule of law, jury nullification is desirable or that courts may permit\nit to occur when it is within their authority to prevent.”); see also United States v. Washington,\n7o5 F.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir. l983) (per curiam) (“A jury has no more ‘right’ to find a ‘guilty’\ndefendant ‘not guilty’ than it has to find a ‘not guilty’ defendant ‘guilty,’ and the fact that the\nformer cannot be corrected by a court, while the later can be, does not create a right out of the\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 49 of 54\npouer to misapply the law. Such verdicts are lawless, a denial of due process and constitute an\nexercise of erroneously seized pouer.” (emphasis in original)).\n\nEven if a defendant offers character evidence, that evidence may not include specific\ninstances of good conduct, unless the defendant’s character is an “essential element” of the\noffense. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(a) & 4o5; see, e.g., United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767, 792 &\nn.77 (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Nachamie, 28 F. App’x l3, 2o-2l (2d Cir. 2ool) (summary\norder). Character evidence is only admissible “by testimony about the person’s reputation or by\ntestimony in the form of an opinion.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o5(a); see, e.g., United States v. Riley, 638\nF. App’x 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2ol6) (summary order) (“The limitations imposed by the district court\nfolloued directly from the Rules of Evidence, which permit a defendant to offer evidence of a\npersonal opinion or his reputation for a pertinent character trait, but not to offer testimony\nregarding ‘specific instances’ of conduct in conformity with a trait that is not at issue.” (citations\nomited)).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any relevant reason for the jury to consider the\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> activities, family history, or similar facts. Because those facts have\nnothing to do with her guilt or innocence, and they are not permissible character evidence, she\nshould be precluded from mentioning such subjects in her opening statement, during the\npresentation of evidence, or in closing statements, absent a ruling that a specific fact is relevant\nand more probative than unfairly prejudicial.\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6l of 69\nevidence during trial; none stands for the specific relief requested by the government: that\n\"before the Court permits the defense to offer evidence or make argument regarding other crimes\nthat did not involve the defendant, the Court should require the defense to proffer the basis and\nrelevance of that evidence.\" For the reasons discussed supra in subsection (A), there is nothing\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require the defense to disclose its argument or\nevidence pre-trial in the manner suggested by the government.\n\nIndeed, the only case cited by the government which dealt with a motion in /imine, Judge\nMatusumoto's decision in United States v. Rivera, No. l3 Cr. l49 (KAM), 2ol5 WL l72599l\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. l5, 2ol5), actually undercuts the government's position.

The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered.

Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations.

The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at... hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span>\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.

The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:\nextreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,\nic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied\nfamilies possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,\ninsulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members\naffected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential\nclients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues\nin this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> operations. Jeffrey’s\nbusiness and personal interests currently employ approximately l6o people. Of these,\nhouever, he is the only income-producing person.\n\nJeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied\naway from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allou him\nthe kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey\n\n° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from l98l to l99o,\nand the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from l99l to 2ooo. (These will be treated in\n\ngreater detail belou.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West\nPalm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he\nwas enrolled as a visiting fellou at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,\nMassachusets.\n\nJeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He\nhas preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy\nand well-knoun people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2oo5, Jeffrey agreed to\naccompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to\nAfrica. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that\nit did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and\notherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.\n\n‘Jeffrey offered the follouing example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the\ndifficulty of knouing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is\ncalled for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the\nimplicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,\nhouever, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur\nand absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.\n\n3\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033224.tif": "Personal Characteristics\nFriendships. Despite his worldly success, Jeffrey has maintained close\nrelationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of\nthese friends atest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always\naccorded them.\nKathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follous:\nIt’s difficult to express hou much Jeffrey's friendship has meant to me\nover the course of my life, but he is nothing short of being my guardian\nangel. I have been blessed with a lifelong friend who regardless of the\nstresses of his oun work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to\nme with gentleness, wisdom and humor.\nI've watched Jeffrey grou from boyhood into one of the hardest working,\nresponsible, and generous men I knou. For instance, when the time came\nto send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible\neducation but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I\n. couldn't afford to send him to an independent school. Jeffrey understood\nhou much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the\ncosts of our son's education. This past June, our son graduated from\n° Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible\nwithout Jeffrey’s long term commitment and generosity.\n\nTerry B. Kafka of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has knoun Jeffrey since\nl958, wrote:\n\nFrom the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was\nalways in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I frequently\ncall upon him for business advise, Jeffrey has always dropped what he\nwas doing to listen and help. .. .\n\nIam aware of Jeffrey’s contributions to <span class=\"highlight\">charitable</span> causes and programs.\nthat he believes will make a difference to mankind and society — many of\nwhich are frankly over my head. On a personal level, I can atest that he\nis also caring when it comes to his friends. I recall a few years ago when\nhe spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my l9 year old son Philip\nto help him sort out academic problems he was having.\n\nWarren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from\nJeffrey’s youth, recalled a number of jointly shared experiences from their younger days,\nincluding the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer\n\n4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33224\n"};
