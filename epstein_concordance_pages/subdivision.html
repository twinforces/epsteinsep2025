Rather, “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly\ndesignated division, we look to that division to see whether there has been any unlawful or\nunconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added). Here,\nconsistent with the SDNY Grand Jury Plan, the venire for the grand jury that indicted the defendant\nwas drawn from the voter lists of the follouing counties: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan, and Dutchess. That is undoubtedly a “properly designated division” pursuant to the\nJSSA. As noted, the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ ll2(b). For purposes of the JSSA, district courts in such undivided districts have the authority\nto determine “divisions” comprised of “counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions\nsurrounding the places where court is held.” 28 U.S.C. § l869(e). Accordingly, while the SDNY\nJury Plan neither creates nor ever uses the term “White Plains Division” or “Manhatan Division,”\nit contemplates Master Jury Wheels drawn from two geographic areas that satisfy the definition of\n“division” under the JSSA. Thus, in evaluating the defendant’s fair cross-section claim, this Court\nmust “look to that division” —the counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn—\n“to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna,\n68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added).\n\nIn the face of this authority, the defendant cites only two district court cases for the\nproposition that “community” for purposes of a fair cross-section claim is “widely understood to\nmean the district or division where the trial will be held.” (Def.

Discussion\n\nThe Minor Victims’ birth certificates are certified and sealed by the appropriate officials,\nand are therefore self-authenticating under Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4). See Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp.,\n45l F.3d 66, 7l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“The original transcript, which includes a certification by the court\nreporter, is self-authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4).”); United States v. McGee, 439 F. App'x\n837, 839 (llth Cir. 2oll) (“We have held that to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9o2(4), a\ncertification need only identify the legal custodian's position of authority, and that the copy is true\nand correct.”).\n\nAt the threshold, domestic birth certificates are “public records” within the meaning of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 9o2(4). See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(9) (providing a hearsay exception for\n“Public Records of Vital Statistics,” including “[a] record of a birth . . . if reported to a public\noffice in accordance with a legal duty.”).\n\nPursuant to Rule 9o2(4)(A), a copy of such a record is self-authenticating if “certified as\ncorrect by: . . . the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification.” Fed. R. Evid.\n9o2(4)(A). That is the case for each of the birth certificates:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nThe birth certificates are also self-authenticating under Rule 9o2(4)(B). That rule permits\nself-authentication based on “a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a federal\nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.” This rule is satisfied in two ways.\n\nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 9o2(l). Each certification bears “a seal\npurporting to be that of... any state .. .; a political <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> . . . ; or a department, agency, or\nofficer of’ a state. Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(A). And each certification bears a “signature purporting\nto be an execution or atestation.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(B). The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\nnecessary to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on this subject). That certification must be “made under seal\n... by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political\n<span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> where the record is kept.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B)(il). Each of the certifications\ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth certificate\nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient. See United States v.\nWeiland, 42o F.3d lo62, lo73 (9th Cir. 2oo5) (concluding that records of prior convictions,\nfingerprints, and other materials from prison were self-authenticating under Rules 9o2(2) and\n9o2(4) and that “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), incorporated into Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 27, accords with our analysis.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started.

Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e)(l).

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion.

The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\ndisclosure of information protected by section 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present. When the actor is a nonclient or when the act is deliberate or malicious, the\nlawyer who contemplates making adverse disclosure of protected information may\nreasonably* conclude that the compelling interests of the lawyer or others in their oun\npersonal safety preclude personal contact with the actor. Before counseling an actor\nwho is a nonclient, the lawyer should, if reasonable* under the circumstances, first\nadvise the client of the lawyer’s intended course of action. If a client or another person*\nhas already acted but the intended harm has not yet occurred, the lawyer should\nconsider, if reasonable* under the circumstances, efforts to persuade the client or third\nperson* to warn the victim or consider other appropriate action to prevent the harm.\nEven when the lawyer has concluded that paragraph (b) does not permit the lawyer to\nreveal information protected by section 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e)(l), the lawyer nevertheless\nis permited to counsel the client as to why it may be in the client’s best interest to\nconsent to the atorney’s disclosure of that information.\nDisclosure of information protected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68,\n<span class=\"highlight\">Subdivision</span> (e)(l) must be no more than is reasonably* necessary to prevent the\ncriminal act\n[8] Paragraph (d) requires that disclosure of information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e) as permited by paragraph (b), when\nmade, must be no more extensive than is necessary to prevent the criminal act.\nDisclosure should allou access to the information to only those persons* who the lawyer\nreasonably believes* can act to prevent the harm.

Therefore, paragraph (c)(2) requires a lawyer to\ninform the client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) only if it is reasonable™* to\ndo so under the circumstances. Paragraph (c)(2) further recognizes that the\nappropriate time for the lawyer to inform the client may vary depending upon the\ncircumstances. (See Comment [lo] of this rule.) Among the factors to be considered in\ndetermining an appropriate time, if any, to inform a client are:\n\n(l) whether the client is an experienced user of legal services;\n\n(2) the frequency of the lawyer's contact with the client;\n\n(3) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(4) whether the lawyer and client have discussed the lawyer’s duty of\nconfidentiality or any exceptions to that duty;\n\n(5) the likelihood that the client's mater will involve information within\nparagraph (b);\n\n(6) — the lawyer’s belief,* if applicable, that so informing the client is likely to\nincrease the likelihood that a criminal act likely to result in the death of, or\nsubstantial* bodily harm to, an individual; and\n\n(7) — the lawyer’s belief,“ if applicable, that good faith efforts to persuade a\nclient not to act on a threat have failed.\n\nAvoiding a chilling effect on the lawyer-client relationship\n[lo] The foregoing flexible approach to the lawyer’s informing a client of his or her\nability or decision to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l4 of l4\nsection 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e)(l) recognizes the concern that informing a client about\nlimits on confidentiality may have a chilling effect on client communication. (See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the\nlawyer will have satisfied the lawyer’s obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be\nsubject to discipline.\n\nInforming client that disclosure has been made; termination of the lawyer-client\nrelationship\n[ll] When a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions\nCode section 6o68, <span class=\"highlight\">subdivision</span> (e) as permited in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary\ncases the relationship between lawyer and client that is based on trust and confidence\nwill have deteriorated so as to make the lawyer’s representation of the client impossible.\nTherefore, when the relationship has deteriorated because of the lawyer’s disclosure,\nthe lawyer is required to seek to withdraw from the representation, unless the client has\ngiven informed consent* to the lawyer’s continued representation. The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyer’s disclosure. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation.
