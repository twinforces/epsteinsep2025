UPS Ground Freight, Inc., No. l6 Civ. 36, 2ol7\nWL 59o5575, at *2 (N.D. Fl. Jul. 25, 2ol7) (citations and internal quotation marks omited). So\ntoo here.?\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions on hindsight bias to “temper” the jurors’\nassessment of the evidence is thus virtually unprecedented. If this Court alloued such testimony\nin this case, houever, it would likely become much more common. This Court should decline to\nopen the door to the routine psychoanalysis of the jury in this way.\n\n3. Opinions as to the “Halo Effect”\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions concerning the “Halo effect”—.e., that “the positive evaluation of\none characteristic has a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual\nare evaluated” (Ex. A at 5)—are irrelevant to any issue to be considered by the jury and appear to\nbe offered in an effort to encourage jury nullification by engendering sympathy for the defendant,\nas well as to offer a factual narrative based on no reliable evidence through a witness plainly\nincompetent to do so.\n\nNone of the charges in this case relate in any way to the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">appraisal</span> of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s character or whether the defendant did or did not view him in the manner suggested by\nthe Halo effect. Simply put, if every word that Dr. Dietz said regarding the “Halo effect” and\nEpstein’s “brilliance” in exploiting it were taken as true, the defendant would be guilty if she met\nthe elements of the charged offenses—exactly as she would be if every word Dr. Dietz said on this\n3 Accordingly, even if the defense somehou put at issue whether a witness’s opinion on some\nmater was affected by hindsight bias—and the Government cannot currently envision hou this is\nlikely—the proper way of litigating an issue so squarely within the ken of the jury is through lay\nevidence and argument, not expert testimony.

Support for such a release was\nbased on the holding that limitations to access of voir dire materials are only permissible when\nthere is a demonstrated need, and the limitations are narrouly drawn and supported by findings.\nId., at 82-83.\n\nThe decision to release jury questionnaires and voir dire transcripts is subject to a\nbalancing test.

The conclusion of the trial does not remove the\nJurors' interest in privacy and protection from harassment. See United States v.

See Hamlet, 2o2l WL 5lo586l, at *2.\n\nEven if any diagnosis were probative, the Court further finds that Rule 4o3 prejudice\noutweighs. First, the testimony may confuse jurors with old diagnoses that have litle connection\nto the conduct at issue or Alleged Victim 4’s credibility today. See id. Confusion is particularly\nlikely here given that Dr. Hall’s report is at times unclear and even contradictory, as with the\nconfusion ov i explained above. /d.

See Hernandez, 2oll WL\n2ll76ll, at *5. Third, mental health diagnoses are of a particularly sensitive nature and, if not\nrelevant, the witness’s privacy should not be invaded. Paredes, 2ool WL l4788lo, at *2 (citing\nIn re Doe, 964 F.2d l325, l328-29 (2d Cir. l992)).\n\nAnd fourth, Dr. Hall’s testimony would be cumulative and cause undue delay.

Vitale, 459 F.3d at l96; Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (applying Vitale and Sasso).\nThe Court concludes that here, the cross-examination identified by the Government on Alleged\nVictim 4’s current medication for ae. along with lines of cross-examination\nunrelated to mental health, will provide the jury a sufficiently “discriminating <span class=\"highlight\">appraisal</span>” of\nAlleged Victim 4’s credibility such that Dr. Hall’s testimony and report is unnecessary.
