The Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained Pursuant to\nthe Subpoena Under the Fifth Amendment Is Without Merit\n\nThe defendant’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to the subpoena on Fifth\nAmendment grounds fails for multiple, independent reasons. As an initial mater, Boies Schiller\nis not the Government and was not acting as an agent of the Government when it deposed the\ndefendant or otherwise litigated the civil case against her. That the defendant may regret her choice\nto respond to Boies Schiller’s questions during two depositions instead of invoking her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination does not <span class=\"highlight\">transform</span> that choice into a Fifth Amendment violation.\n\na. Applicable Law\ni. The Fifth Amendment — Generally\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part: “No person . . . shall be compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. To establish a Fifth\nAmendment violation, an individual must “demonstrate the existence of three elements:\nl) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication, and 3) the incriminating nature of that\ncommunication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d ll66, ll68 (l987); see also, e.g., In Re\nThree Grand Jury Subpoenas Jan. 5, l988, 847 F.2d lo24, lo28 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nIt is “axiomatic that the Amendment does not automatically preclude self-incrimination,\nwhether spontaneous or in response to questions put by government officials.” United States v.\nWashington, 43l U.S. l8l, l86 (l977). “Indeed, far from being prohibited by the Constitution,\nadmissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable.” Jd. at l87. “[T]he\nFifth Amendment proscribes only self-incrimination obtained by a ‘genuine compulsion of\ntestimony.’” /d. (quoting Michigan v. Tucker, 4l7 U.S. 433, 44o (l974)); see also Washington,\n43l U.S. at l87 (“Absent some officially coerced self-accusation, the Fifth Amendment privilege\nis not violated by even the most damning admissions.”).

The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003782.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8of2o\n\nFirst, the Court recognized that\n\n[t]here is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information\n\naddressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location information\n\ncasually collected by wireless carriers today. The Government thus is not asking\n\nfor a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant\n\nextension of it to a distinct category of information.\n\nId. at 22l9. Second, the Court concluded that in “in no meaningful sense” did Carpenter\nvoluntarily “assume the risk” of “turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical\nmovements.” /d. at 222o.\n\nThe same logic applies here. There is “world of difference between the limited types of\npersonal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive” and personal details\nabout Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller’s 9o,ooo pages of confidential material.\nThese details include, for example, information about Maxwell’s sexual partners, sexual habits,\nfinances, and much, much more.\n\nMoreover, “in no meaningful sense” did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with\nBoies Schiller. Giuffre sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the\nonly claim Giuffre ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing\nto do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide.\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for\nseverance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell Pre-Trial Mot.\nNos. 4 & 5.\n\nBut the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrou, but Boies\nSchiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and\nMaxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing Giuffre, which then compelled Maxwell, over\nobjection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal questions. None of it was\nvoluntary.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3782\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page 8of2l\ninculpatory. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 4lo-ll. This is no such case. The existence of deposition\ntranscripts in Maxwell’s civil case is not inculpatory. It is the content of those transcripts that is\nat issue.\n\nIn the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relies primarily on a single\ndistrict court case decided the year before the Second Circuit’s decision in Andover that quashed\na subpoena for deposition testimony covered by a civil protective order. See Dkt. No. l4o, at\nl6-l7 (citing United States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988)); Dkt. No. 2l2, at l2-\nl3 (same). Oshatz does not suggest that the use of civil deposition testimony in a subsequent\ncriminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against compelled self-incrimination—and if it\ndid, that view would be plainly inconsistent with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential\nopinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a court should modify a\nprotective order to allou a government subpoena. Maxwell cites no case in which a court has\nsuppressed evidence because another court erred in modifying a protective order. Even if\nMaxwell were right that the protective order should not have been modified, it would not\n<span class=\"highlight\">transform</span> her earlier deposition testimony into the product of coercion.\n\nThe Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against\nher in her perjury trial notwithstanding any violation of her right against compelled self-\nincrimination. The Supreme Court has held that a defendant may be prosecuted for false\nstatements in unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l79\n(l977); United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (l969). As in Knox, Maxwell seeks to suppress\nher deposition transcripts not because they are inculpatory “for a prior or subsequent criminal\nact” but because her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal. Knox,\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 7o of 84\nthere are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

(See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

But even if it is not, it is certainly admissible under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Direct Evidence\n\nAs the Government argued in its motion, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is direct\nevidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. The defendant’s conduct regarding Minor Victim-3\noverlaps in time and place with the other Minor Victims charged in the Mann Act conspiracies:\nCounts One and Three charge conduct from l994 to 2oo4 in New York and Palm Beach, and\nMinor Victim-3 began giving Epstein sexualized massages in l994, traveling to meet Epstein and\nthe defendant in both New York and Palm Beach. The Government expects the defendant’s\nrelationship with Epstein to be a “‘critical factual dispute’”— specifically, whether that relationship\nincluded conspiring with him and aiding or abeting Epstein’s sex crimes. United States v.\nRobinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol2). Minor Victim-3’s testimony will help establish that it\ndid.\n\nEvidence relating to Minor Victim-3 also “fills in a narrative” about “why [the defendant]\ntook actions to” arrange sexualized massages. United States v. Rodriguez, 727 F. App’x 24, 26\n(2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). Poe\nee\nee\na\n\nFinally, evidence related to Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence as corroboration for the other\nthree Minor Victims. Those Minor Victims will describe a conspiracy that operated to recruit girls\nfor the purposes of massage, groom them, and <span class=\"highlight\">transform</span> the massages into sexual encounters. The\nconspirators then traveled with the girls or invited girls to travel, and asked the girls to find others\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 355 of 375\nLaPorte CV (Version 2o2o.3) Page 2 of l9\nUnited States Secret Service (o4/ol — o3/o9)\nChief Research Forensic Chemist (ll/o7-o3/o9); Senior Document Analyst\n(o6/o5-ll/o7); Document Analyst (o4/ol-o6/o5)\nDuties: Serve as the technical liaison and research chemist for the United States\nSecret Service pertaining to issues related to the chemistry of documents and\nfingerprints; coordinating clandestine tagging programs; direct all research\nprojects within the Forensic Services Division.\nLaboratory Duties: perform physical and chemical examinations on a variety of\ndocuments to determine hou they were produced, where they may have\noriginated from, and if they are authentic.

She is youngest of\nnine siblings. A sister died of childhood leukemia years before Ghislaine was born. Two days\nfollouing Ghislaine’s birth, her eldest sibling, Michael, was seriously and permanently injured in\na car accident. He remained in a coma on and then off life support for the next seven years.\nFamily Tragedy and Controversy’®\n\nThe tragedy caused by Michael’s accident and coma disrupted the equilibrium of the\nMaxwell family and transformed young Ghislaine’s formative years. Ghislaine was hardly given\na glance and became anorexic while still a toddler. At age three, she stood in front of her mother\nand said simply, “Mummy, I exist.” On doctor’s orders exactly a year after Michael’s accident,\nher mother went on a long tour of India and Australia, leaving infant Ghislaine and her siblings\nnot already in boarding school at home in the care of a nanny.\n\nWith Robert Maxwell’s publishing company grouing and his political career launched, the\nMaxwell home was filled with prominent guests and ongoing entertaining. As the children grew,\nthey took part in the hosting of guests, having been instructed by their parents to be atentive to\nthe needs of the guests. Despite Mr. Maxwell’s professed love for his children, his relationship\nwith them began to change soon after he became a Member of Parliament. He stopped living at\nhome regularly, essentially seeing the children only on Sunday, leaving litle normal daily contact\nbetween father and child to counterbalance the peaks of crisis and drama he created in the family.\nEven on those Sundays there was an inevitable contingent of authors and businesspeople in whose\n° The follouing discussion amplifies information contained in the PSR at 9l34-l78.\n\n'° This section is corroborated by the autobiography of Ghislaine’s mother, Elisabeth Maxwell: A Mind of\nMy Own (Harper Collins l994).\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo456\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020380.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page22 of 24\n\n38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture\nis whether Judge Nathan commited clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight\nrisk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell temporary release. Nothing\nin the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a\nreal risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain hou Judge Nathan’s\ncareful consideration of the MDC’s nightime security protocols and continued\nmonitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with\ncounsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion. Simply\nput, the renewed motion fails to present any “compelling” reason for this Court to\nreverse its prior decision in this case. Plugh, 648 F.3d at l23.\nto review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. 235 at 7 n.4; Dkt. l96 at l-2). Among\nother things, Maxwell has exclusive access to both a desktop and a laptop computer\non which to review her discovery, thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. She\nis also able to review discovery with her atorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-\nteleconference calls she receives each week. (See Dkt. l96 at l-2).\n\n22.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o38o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020777.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel59 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o777\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021074.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page27 of ll3\n\nThe Government announced its arrest of Maxwell on July 2, 2o2o, the\nanniversary of Epstein’s indictment. From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary\nconfinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District\nCourt denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate\nMaxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell\nwas so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her\noun defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both\nscale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was\nenormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with\nits terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell\nfrom presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that\nwas central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2oo6 FBI investigation, the terms\nof the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil atorneys in both\nthe VCP and the Government’s investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,\nKate, and Carolyn), were permited to testify under pseudonyms. The result\ntransformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at\nevery turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy\ninterests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo74\n"};
