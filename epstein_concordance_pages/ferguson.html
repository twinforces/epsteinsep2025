Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467, 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF\nclients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require\nproduction of the engagement leters to the Court so that the information can be made available\nto Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct testimony. See United\nStates v. Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), l992 WL 29644o, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y.

Dec.\n26, 2oo7).\n\nMaxwell also argues that compulsion of the materials’ production under Rule l7(c) is\njustified because the materials appear not to have been produced by BSF in response to the grand\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 252 Filed o4/27/2l Page8of9\nthe Court so that the information may be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the\nconclusion of each witness’s direct testimony.

The Court assumes that the Government has enough\ninformation, based on the public filings, to provide its views. If the Government seeks the\nspecific subpoena requests, it shall confer with defense counsel and raise any dispute with the\nCourt. The Government shall file its response within one week of this Order.\n\nIn sum, for Request l through 8 and l2, the Court will not authorize service of the\nproposed subpoena on the basis that Maxwell has failed to establish that the requests are\nsufficiently specific and that the materials sought are relevant or admissible. Maxwell may\nrenew more tailored requests in compliance with this Order. The Court sees no basis for doing\nso on an ex parte basis. For Requests 9 through ll, the Court will reserve its decision until it\nhears from the Government.\n\nB. The Government’s Subpoena-Related Request\n\nThe Government seeks a preemptive, blanket ruling that it be entitled notice of all future\nsubpoenas, an opportunity to challenge them, and production of any information obtained\ntherefrom. This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena\nfor which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the\nCourt would likely consider the Government’s briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty\nto ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon. See United States v. Bergstein, No.\nl6-CR-746 (PKC), 2ol7 WL 6887596, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2ol7). But ex parte Rule l7(c)\nsubpoenas are possible in some circumstances if justified.

The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied on the Current Record\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” “The\ndefendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule 33, and before\nordering a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, a district court must find that there is ‘a real concern that\nan innocent person may have been convicted.’” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d\nCir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Ferguson</span>, 246 F.3d l29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool)). “It is well\nsetled that motions for new trials are not favored and should be granted only with great caution.”\nUnited States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir. l997)) (alterations in\nSimilarly, Juror 5o told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our due diligence” before reaching a\nverdict, and that the defendant’s decision not to testify “was simply set to one side and not\ndiscussed during deliberations.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” <span class=\"highlight\">Ferguson</span>, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v.

B at 5). Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” <span class=\"highlight\">Ferguson</span>, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v.

One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which\n“expos[es] possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential jurors,” by\neliciting information under oath. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,\n554 (l984).\n\nOnce a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and\nthe moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof.

Maxwell Br. at 22—28, Dkt. No. 642; Gov. Br. at ll, Dkt. No.\n643. In McDenough, the Supreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror\nnondisclosure during voir dire, “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would\nhave provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also\nUnited States v.
