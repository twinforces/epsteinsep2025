Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE.

For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001842.jpg": ".

If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing\nDefendants’ twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits,\nunder temporary seal pending the Court’s resolution of its request to redact sensitive or\nconfidential information. See Dkt. No. l62.

Having considered the parties’ <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> positions, the Court will grant the\nGovernment’s requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant’s additional\nredaction requests, with the exceptions discussed belou.\n\nTo begin with, the Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at\nl2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (““Amodeo I?’)).\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 9 of l2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *l. Because Westchester, Putnam, and :\nRockland counties are included in both master wheels, the Jury Plan instructs that the names\nfrom these counties be “apportioned among the two master wheels to ‘reasonably reflect the\nrelative number of registered voters of each county.’” See id.\n“Periodically, names are drawn from the master wheels ‘in an amount sufficient to meet |\nthe anticipated demands for jurors for the next six months.” Jd.

The additional time will ensure that the\nfull factual record is developed before the Court conducts the multiplicity analysis, and the motion\nmay become moot depending on the jury’s verdict.\n\nFirst, the Court cannot conduct the multiplicity analysis before hearing all of the evidence\nregarding the charges contained in the Indictment. Prior to trial, the record will not be fully\ndeveloped, and the Court cannot conduct the necessary analysis to determine whether the counts\nare in fact multiplicitous.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> views of\nthe case.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !“°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'* When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut\ndoun an ongoing FBI probe ... .” Julie K.

Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 34\n\nThe Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers\nany evidence related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule\nl6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence.\n\nThe Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial\ndisclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including\nco-conspirator statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the\nidentity of victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government’s witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental\nmotions briefing in light of the S2 indictment.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 57 of 349\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> views of\nthe case.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order.

Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l88 of 349\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses.

Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived. Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\n<span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> allegations of abuse.

After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future.

The government’s motion seeks to unfairly capitalize on this Court’s\ndecision largely overruling Ms. Maxwell’s Daubert challenge to the government’s expert, Dr.\nLisa Rocchio. If the government gets its way, Dr. Rocchio will present the jury with a one-sided\nversion of events while Ms. Maxwell will be crippled in her ability to respond. This Court should\nnot permit the asymmetry the government hopes to create.\n\nThere is no dispute that Drs. Dietz and Loftus are supremely qualified in their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span>\nareas of expertise. Atached as Exhibit l is the defense disclosure of the expert opinions of Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus. That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (transcript of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s construction of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case. To the extent the government contends these opinions don’t “fit,” that objection is flat-\nout wrong or at least premature, since the government hasn’t put any evidence on yet.

United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, (2d\n\nl3 Cir. 2ooo). That's the first legal principle that frames the\nl4 discussion here.\n\nl5 Second, arguments that the government had an improper\nl6 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the\nl7 jury. United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, (2d Cir. l997);\nl8 see also, United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27 (2d Cir.\n\nl9 2oll).\n2o Third legal principle: There is no per se bar on\n2l admiting evidence of the government's charging decisions.\n22 Rather, the Court must -- I will quote here -- \"inquire into\n23 its relevance and probative value to the <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> case.\"\n24 United States v.

(/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the massage oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). Alessi explained during his trial testimony that he understood he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011225.jpg": "NYSCEF DOC.

By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019348.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page6 of 24\n\nrequest modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> protective orders to permit compliance with\nthe Subpoenas.

Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE.

The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations.

The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

(Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has\nspoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement and has tried\nto gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the\nGovernment has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense\ncounsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden\nHeriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> positions\nfollou.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the Court should allou MDC legal counsel to\nrespond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense\ncounsel has raised relating to the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The Government\nunderstands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a leter by this Friday, December 4,\n2o2o. Such a leter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allou the Court to hear\ndirectly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant’s conditions of confinement. The\nleter will allou the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by\nthe Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not\nunderstand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials\nor her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government’s leter dated\nNovember 23, 2o2o, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any\nother inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC\ninmate to communicate with her atorneys. (Dkt. No. 74).\n\nThe defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position is as\nfollous: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns\nregarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October\n29, 2o2o, the defense emailed a leter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive\nconditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020410.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page24 of 9l\n\no3/o9/2o2l | l65 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span>\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span>\nproposals.

On February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its\nomnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed the\nbrief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the Court's\nresolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See Dkt. No. l62.\nOn March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the\nGovernment had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered\nthe parties' <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for\nredactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the\nexceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file\nExhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other\nportions are part of the public record. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt.\nNo. l2l2-l. In light of this, the Court sees no basis to file the transcript entirely under\nseal rather than by redacting the relevant portions. In light of the above, the Government\nis hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits,\nconsistent with this Order, or to file a leter with the Court justifying more tailored\nredaction and sealing requests regarding pages ll28 and l87l88 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by\nno later than March 22, 2o2l. The parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and\njointly propose redactions to the Defendant's cover leter objecting to the Government's\nproposed redactions by March 22, 2o2l.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

Its\nconclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must:\n(l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. The Court\nconcludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common\nlaw presumptions of access atach. But in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has\nput forward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third\nparties referenced in the documents, favor the narrouly tailored redactions. See United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR identified former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested.\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021230.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pageds of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 348\nhe is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why\nshe was in a “rush” “given hou long this case has been pending.”\n\nOPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing\nthe prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for ‘“‘a sense of the direction where we are headed-l.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’””*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafafia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n44 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> views of\nthe case.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”'*? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. /*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised.\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!*? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'44 When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nl4o This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nlal OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\nIe Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\ntas As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nl For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021361.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel89 of 258\nSA-l87\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\n\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021954.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl3-l Filed l2/l6/l9 Pageilof5\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee eee eee LLL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA i PROTECTIVE ORDER\naT = : l9 Cr. 83o (AT)\n\nTOVA NOEL and $\nMICHAEL THOMAS,\n\nDefendants.\n\nOn the motion of the United States of America, by the United\nStates Atorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey S.\nBerman, by Assistant United States Atorneys Rebekah Donaleski,\nNicolas Roos, and Jessica Lonergan; and with the consent of TOVA\nNOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, by and through their\n<span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel of record:\n\nWHEREAS, TOVA NOEL and MICHAFL THOMAS, the defendants, have\ncertain rights under the United States Constitution, federal\nstatutes, and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to pretrial\ndiscovery;\n\nWHEREAS, the Government recognizes its obligation to provide\nsuch discovery materials to the defendants, consistent with the\nneed to protect the confidentiality of ongoing investigations and\nthe confidentiality interests of others;\n\nWHEREAS, the discovery that the Government intends to provide\nto the defendants contain materials that, if disseminated to third\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l954\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021955.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl3-l Filed l2/l6/l9 Page2of5\nparties, could, among other things, impede ongoing investigations\nand implicate the privacy and confidentiality interests of third\nparties;\n\nWHEREAS, the Government has demonstrated good cause for the\nrelief set forth herein;\n\nWHEREAS, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, by and\nthrough their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel of record, consent to the entry\nof this Order;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l6(d):\n\nLiss Discovery materials designated as “Protected Materials”\nby the Government may be used by the defendants, their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span>\ncounsel of record, and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel of record’s agents\n(collectively, the “Defense”) only for purposes of defending the\ncharges, in connection with any sentencing, and pursuing any\nappeals, in relation to this criminal action.\n\n2.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafaia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\n“4 Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.tif": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> views of\nthe case.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°?

Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world.

Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.tif": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.3°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023373.tif": "referred to as a “round sheet’) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in\nfact, they had not.°\nOn November l9, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\nreturned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple\ncounts each of falsification of records, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, lool(a)(3), and 2. The indictment\nalleged that on August 9, 2ol9, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and lo p.m. counts of inmates\nin the MCC New York SHU, and that on August lo, 2ol9, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the\nmandatory l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 3o-minute rounds within the MCC New York\nSHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submited false\ndocumentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to\nperform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,\nincluding Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9, until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, when\nEpstein was found hanged in his cell.\nOn May 25, 2o2l, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred\nprosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> agreements, which are part of the court\nrecord in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had\nconducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely\ndisclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the\nU.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete loo hours of\ncommunity service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision\nand their establishment of good behavior. On December l3, 2o2l, after Noel and Thomas successfully\nfulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all\ncharges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count\nslips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and\nThomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor\njudgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.\nI. Methodology\nDuring the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one\noccasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023419.jpg": "Epstein, and he said he told the second atorney that Epstein could not be housed without a cellmate\nbecause of his prior suicide atempt.\nC. Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their <span class=\"highlight\">respective</span> shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023433.tif": "Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count\nand create a new count slip, but she did not knou if they had actually done so.\nDuring his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate\ntransfer, the l2 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this\nmaterial, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the l2 a.m. SHU count slip was inaccurate because it continued to\nlist 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas completed and signed SHU\ncount slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the\nl2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts at approximately l2:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:3o a.m.,\nrespectively.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023753.jpg": "The request for the meeting should be sent to both MCC and MDC\nLegal Departments.

For example, there\nwere two concurrently open atorney log books in the Atorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the\ntwo atorney log books, one in the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books\ncould not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not\nconsistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled,\nlog book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the\ncurrent time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.\nInstitution Response: 9. Atorney Log Books:\nOn August lo, 2ol9, log books deemed relevant to the investigation were removed from various locations\nthroughout the facility. The Reconstruction Team did identify pertinent logbooks that had not been secured. At this\ntime, all relevant logbooks have been removed and replaced. In addition, a logbook audit was conducted to ensure\naccuracy of the documentation and compliance with policy. Measures are being taken to ensure in the future that all\nrelevant logbooks are identified, secured immediately and replaced with new ones to ensure the institution can\ncontinue to run efficiently.\nlo.

Further, the different purposes of the\ntwo atorney log books, one in the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books\ncould not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not\nconsistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled,\nlog book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the\ncurrent time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.\nInstitution Response: 9. Atorney Log Books:\nOn August lo, 2ol9, log books deemed relevant to the investigation were removed from various locations\nthroughout the facility.
