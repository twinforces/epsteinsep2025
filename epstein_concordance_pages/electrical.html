Of all\nthe cells in the SHU, cell Zo6-22o was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in\nthe common area of the SHU, which was approximately l5 feet away.\nInmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell ZO6-22o in the L Tier,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who\nwould not bother Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the\nbotom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new\ncellmate slept on the floor. Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that\nsleeping on the floor was not alloued and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.\nWhen Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said\nhe knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch.

Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the <span class=\"highlight\">electrical</span> cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\n<span class=\"highlight\">electrical</span>, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll.

Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein.

As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">electrical</span> cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2o22 investigation and\nreview of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and\n56 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera\nSystem, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’\nManagement and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 2l-o9l (July 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal\nBureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report l6-o5 (June 2ol6).\n\n96\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023480.jpg": "6. The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, <span class=\"highlight\">electrical</span>, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5). Additionally, multiple remote inspections the OIG\nconducted as part of its pandemic response oversight work revealed that staffing shortages impacted the BOP’s ability\nto respond to inmates’ medical needs during the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 pandemic.
