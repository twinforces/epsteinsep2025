You just mentioned user inputable. Just briefly, what\n\nl4 does that mean?\n\nl5 A.

You just mentioned user inputable. Just briefly, what\n\nl4 does that mean?\n\nl5 A. That means when you first start the computer, it asks who\nl6 is the organization, who ouns this, and you answer, you type in\nl7 on a keyboard.\n\nl8 Q. What is listed as the registered organization?\n\nl9 A. Gmax.\n2o Q. And what is registered ouner?\n2l A.
