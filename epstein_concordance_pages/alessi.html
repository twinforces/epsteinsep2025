First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\ncumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 3 of 26\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES\nCases\nEvans v.

Mot. at ll) (emphasis in original). The\ndefendant is wrong. Annabi contains no such exception, and the Government is not aware of any\ncourt in this Circuit to apply such a rule.\n\nIn Annabi, the Second Circuit articulated a universal principle for interpreting whether a\nplea agreement is binding outside the district where it was executed. Annabi explained that,\nalthough it “might be thought” that a U.S. Atorney’s Office’s agreement which provided that “‘the\nGovernment’ will dismiss counts of an indictment” would bind the United States in every judicial\ndistrict, “the law has evolved to the contrary.” 77l F.2d at 672. Relying on several of its\nprecedents, the Court explained that the default rule in this Circuit is that plea agreements bind\nonly the district involved, absent an affirmative appearance to the contrary. /d. In particular, the\nSecond Circuit relied on its opinions in United States v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d lo65, lo72 (2d Cir.\nl985), and United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, 544 F.2d ll39, ll54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 96o\n(l976). Nothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same\noffenses that were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be\ncovered by the plea agreement. The holding of Annabi is clear and straightforward, and this Court\nhas already concluded that, under Annabi, there is no affirmative appearance that the NPA binds\nentities aside from the USAO-SDFL.\n\nThe defendant nou claims that when the Government brings charges that are similar to\nthose contained in a plea agreement, Annabi is silent, and that the Court is therefore free to apply\nthe opposite presumption, namely, that the plea agreement is universally binding on the\nGovernment. The defendant’s argument rests exclusively on the phrase “identical to the dismissed\ncharges,” which appears in a paragraph in Annabi. (Def. Mot. at ll). The defendant’s reliance on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 8 of 26\n\nthis phrase is entirely misplaced. That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page6of9\nevidence on a material mater, and they should be admited.\n\nB. Other Photographs\n\nMany of the remaining photographs of Epstein’s house corroborate other testimony by\nJane. As with the nude pictures in the massage room, each of these photographs is consistent with\ntestimony about Epstein’s practices, so they are probative corroboration of that testimony.\n\nFirst, Jane testified that Epstein used vibrators and back massagers of sizes while abusing\nher. (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 3lo). Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, whose testimony corroborated Jane, also testified that he\nfound two different kinds of vibrating back massagers after Epstein received massages, and that\nthose massagers were kept in Epstein’s bathroom in Palm Beach. (l2/o2/2l Tr. at 894-95).\n\nThe Government recovered two vibrating massagers in the bathroom of the New York\nhome adjacent to the massage room. The Government therefore seeks admission of two photos,\nGovernment Exhibits 9l8 and 92l, depicting those two devices:\n\n[Redacted]\nThe point of this evidence is not to shou that these vibrators are the particular vibrators used on\nJane. It is to shou that they are the type that were used on Jane, and corroborate Jane’s testimony\nby shouing that Epstein did, consistent with the modus operandi of the conspiracy from the mid-\nl99os through the early 2ooos, possess this sort of massager device.\n\nSecond, Jane testified that the home contained “creepy looking animals.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at\n3 The Government could not elicit testimony from Jane about these photographs without\nsubstantially diminishing the probative force of the evidence. Before shouing the photographs to\nJane on the stand, the Government would surely need to shou her the photographs in advance.\nDoing so would permit an inference that Jane tailored her testimony about her memories of the\nmassage room to the photographs, thereby vitiating the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page 8of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As for the\nvibrators, the government does not contend the vibrators are the “particular vibrators used on\nJane,” only that they are “they type” of vibrators used on Jane. Gov. Leter at lo. But there is no\ntestimony to support that argument, because Jane did not describe the vibrators other than to say\nthey were “different sizes.” TR ll/2o/2o2l, p 3lo:l4-l5.3 And because the government did not\nshou these photos to Jane, there is no evidence that they are “the type” she claims Mr. Epstein\nused on her. If they were “the type,” Jane could easily have said so on the stand.\n\nThe tiger next. Jane testified that Mr. Epstein had “animals” and “animal heads” and\n“strange things” in the house that were “a litle creepy personally.” /d. at 3l8:5-l3. She did not\ntestify or describe a tiger. There’s no foundation to admit that photograph, or the photograph of a\nstuffed dog, which Jane also did not describe. Gov.

Again, Ms. Maxwell does not challenge photos of the outside of Mr. Epstein’s\napartment. But photos of the inside of the apartment are a different mater.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nThis is at least the third atempt by the government to admit an unreliable exhibit of\nunknoun origin. The problems are manifold, as this Court is aware.\n\nWhen the government last sought admission, after the testimony of Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, this\nCourt reserved ruling, recognizing that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> had neither authenticated Exhibit 52 nor laid\nthe required foundation for its admission under Rule 8o3(6).\n\nRest assured, promised the government, it would fill in the blanks through the testimony\nof Employee-l. But the government no longer plans to call Employee-l as a witness, so it’s left\nwith a record this Court already deemed inadequate to justify admission of the exhibit.\n\nUndeterred, the government nou, for the very first time, points to something else—Ms.\nMaxwell’s April 2ol6 civil deposition. The government claims that Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntestimony authenticates Exhibit 52.\n\nThe government is wrong, for at least two obvious reasons. First, the exhibit Ms.\nMaxwell was shoun in her deposition (Deposition Exhibit l3) is not the same thing as Exhibit\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document532 Filed l2/o9/2l Page3of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

R. Evid. 8o3(6).\n\nPages 3 to 6 of the government’s leter rehash arguments the government has already\nmade and this Court has already rejected. Ms. Maxwell will not repeat here why these arguments\nfail. (Ms. Maxwell incorporates those arguments by reference.)\n\nWhat’s new is the government’s atempt to rely on Ms. Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition\ntestimony and in particular the questions she was asked and the answers she gave concerning\nDeposition Exhibit l3. The government’s reliance is not persuasive.\n\nFirst, Deposition Exhibit l3 is not the same thing as Exhibit 52. Deposition Exhibit l3 is\na photocopy of some pages of some document. There is no explanation from where the\nphotocopy came, when it was made, who made it, what it purports to be a copy of, whether it is a\ncomplete copy, or whether it is an accurate copy. Whatever it is, it is not a copy of Exhibit 52. (It\nhas, for example, several handwriten pages that aren’t contained in the government’s trial\nexhibit.) Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater. As Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> explained in testimony this Court deemed\ninadequate to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit 52 is not the same as the books he saw during his\nemployment with Mr. Epstein. The books in use when he was an employee were two inches\nthick. Exhibit 52 is l/4 inch thick.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document532 Filed l2/o9/2l Page6of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 8, 2o2l\nPage 6\nId. at 33l. The government’s atempt to authenticate Exhibit 52 through Ms. Maxwell’s\ntestimony about something else entirely fails.\n\nThe flaws in the government’s argument don’t end with these two problems, though each\nproblem itself is dispositive of the government’s request. The government’s leter focuses\nexclusively on the authentication question. The government does not address the business records\nexception or even atempt to justify the admission of Exhibit 52 despite it being hearsay.\n\nThe government also conveniently ignores all it said before about why Exhibit 52 was\nrelevant and hou it would be admited and used as evidence. The government first said Exhibit\n52 was Ms. Maxwell’s book. That was the entire premise of the government’s November l2\nleter and its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion in limine. But no witness has testified that it\nwas Ms. Maxwell’s book, and the government has abandoned that argument.!\n\nThe government next said it would call Employee-l as a witness to authenticate the\nexhibit and lay the foundation for its admission and, in turn, to testify that Exhibit 52 belonged to\nMs. Maxwell. But no more. The government’s decision not to call Employee-l confirms what\nMs. Maxwell has been saying all along: Exhibit 52 did not belong to her, and Employee-l was\nnever going to testify that it did.\n\nFinally, it would be exceedingly unfair were the government to admit Exhibit 52 at this\nlate stage in its case, having nou abandoned its earlier arguments for admissibility and relevance.\nAs this Court recognized earlier today, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> is done testifying, and Ms. Maxwell cannot be\n\n' We knou the government has abandoned this argument because it relies on Ms.\nMaxwell’s deposition testimony as the basis for admiting Exhibit 52.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid sufficient foundation for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the household manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and recognized it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he recognized from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically recognized entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G.

Tr. at 864. He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853. That is confirmed by the date inside the book (2oo4-2oo5) and the fact that it contains\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document533 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nthe name of Sarah Kellen, who began working for Epstein shortly before <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> left his\nemployment. Tr. at 832; see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (permiting authentication based on the\n“contents” of the item). <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s foundation rested largely on <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52. (See id. at 872-73, 875 “The botom line\nhere, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, you don’t have any personal knouledge about first hou or when Exhibit 52 was\ncreated; correct?”).! But authentication does not require evidence about the circumstances of the\ncreation or seizure of a piece of evidence, so long as it can be identified by its distinctive markings\nas what the proponent claims it is. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25. It is well setled that\ndefects in chain of custody go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSecond, the household manual—dating from 2oo5, the year on Government Exhibit 52—\ndemonstrates that the practice identified by <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> remained in operation into 2oo5. The manual\nexplains that “[t]elephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone\ndirectories are available.” GX 6o6 at 7. And it explained that the directories in fact belong to the\ndefendant and Epstein: a copy of their directories “must be placed to the right of each telephone\n(except for the Guestrooms).” GX 6o6 at 7.\n\nThird, the contents of Government Exhibit 52 have been confirmed by other evidence to\naccurately reflect relationships between the defendant and other individuals.

A jury could\nreasonably conclude from the content of the book, in combination with <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s testimony, that\nthis contact book in fact belonged to Epstein and the defendant. That is all that is required for\nauthentication.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defendant’s challenge to the authenticity of\nGovernment Exhibit 52 relies heavily on the circumstances through which the Government\nobtained the book, namely, by seizing it from Alfredo Rodriguez. See, e.g., Mot., Dkt. No. 39o at\n3; Leter, Dkt. No. 49o. To the extent the Court exercises its gatekeeping function through\nexamination of evidence that the jury is not considering, the Government notes that the defendant\nherself has acknouledged the authenticity of the contact book.\n\nSpecifically, in her April 2ol6 deposition, the defendant was confronted with a document\nthat appears to be a scan of the contact book and some additional pages. (See Exhibit A (Maxwell\nDeposition Ex. l3)). When shoun the scan, the defendant was asked whether she was familiar\nwith the document, and she replied that she was familiar with the “actual document.” (Exhibit B\n(Maxwell Depo. Tr.) at 3l2).

R. Evid. 9ol(a). The bar for authentication is “not\n! The Defense previously agreed that if GX 52 is admited, it will stipulate that Government Exhibits 52A, 52D,\n52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are true and correct photocopies of five pages from GX 52. Trial Tr. at 858.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page2of8\nparticularly high.” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72 (2d Cir. 2oo8). It does not\nrequire ruling out “all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity,” or “prov[ing] beyond any\ndoubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.” United States v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658\n(2d Cir. 2ool). Rather, all that is required is “sufficient proof... so that a reasonable juror could\nfind in favor of authenticity or identification.” Jd. This “minimal” standard can be satisfied by\nthe “testimony of a witness with knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be.” United\nStates v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7). Once this “minimal” standard is met, “the\nother party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its\nimportance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other\nchallenges go to the weight of the evidence—not to its admissibility.” United States v. Tin Yat\nChin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 8ol defines “hearsay” as ‘“‘a statement that a party offers in\nevidence to prove the truth of the mater asserted in the statement.” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(c)(2).\n\nIl. ANALYSIS\n\nThe Court first addresses authentication under Rule 9ol and concludes that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s\ntestimony is sufficient to meet this Rule’s standard. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that he worked in the\nPalm Beach residence from l99o to December 2oo2. Trial Tr. at 778. His job required him to\nspend a significant amount of time in the residence. /d. at 779-8o. Based on his years working\nat the residence, he recalled that Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell maintained telephone directories\nand that GX 52 was a version of those directories.\n\nHe first testified about the function of the telephone directories in the Palm Beach\nresidence, and that he recalled first seeing the directories in l995 or l996. Id. at 849. He\ntestified where in the home the directories were kept—“in the kitchen desk,” “Ms. Maxwell’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page3of8\ndesk,” “Mr. Epstein’s three desks he had in the house,” “Ms. Maxwell’s each side of her night\ntable or Mr. Epstein’s night table.” Jd. He testified that the directories were updated either once\nor twice a year, and new contacts were added in each new copy. /d. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s testimony on\nthis score is corroborated by Government Exhibit 6o6, the “Household Manual.” See id. 827-28\n(Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> identifying the manual’s reference to “JE and GM telephone directories” as “books\nwith hundreds and hundreds of names and their telephone numbers” (referring to GX 6o6 at lo));\nsee also GX 6o6 at 7 (“A copy of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell’s telephone directories must be\nplaced to the right of each telephone (except for the Guestrooms).”).\n\nHe also explained the physical appearance of the directories he observed while working\nfor Mr. Epstein. He explained hou the books had a “type of hard binding,” were either “blue or\nblack,” and the “size of a large telephone.” Trial Tr. at 827-28. And as to the contents, he\ntestified that the directories he observed contained: “a list of alphabetical order of all the people,\nfriends and families and business with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,” id. at 828; Jane’s contact\ninformation in particular, id. at 848-49; and “a page with the massages—massage therapists for\nPalm Beach,” id.\n\nUpon examining GX 52, he testified that “the type of book, it was the same” as the\ndirectories he had just recalled observing during at least six of his over ten years of employment\nwith Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein. /d. at 85o. As for the appearance, he testified that GX 52\nhad “exactly the same cover of the directories that I saw,” “the same binding,” and “exactly” the\n“layout” as the books he recalled. /d. at 85l. While he did note that GX 52 was thinner and had\n“much smaller font” than the books he recalled, he overall testified that the “format was the\nsame.” /d. at 852. And as for the contents, he testified that he had reviewed every page of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nexhibit and that he recognized “many, many, many, many names” amongst the entries, including\nsome of the entries that were for “massage in Palm Beach.” /d. at 85l.\n\nThe Defense first objects that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> has no personal knouledge about the creation of\nthis particular directory and is thus incapable of authenticating the exhibit. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>\nacknouledged that GX 52 was a different version than the directories he was familiar with\nbecause GX 52 was not as thick as those versions, and his name and his wife’s name were in the\nversion he observed, but neither his name nor his wife’s name was in GX 52. Id. at 853, 865.\nBut a document may be admited under 9ol(b)(4) even when no witness saw the creation of the\ndocument or the particular copy admited at trial.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o), the court\naffirmed the district court’s authentication of handwriten leters even though no testifying\nwitness confirmed they had previously examined the leters. Instead, testimony that the\n“appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics” of the\nleters were consistent with other leters previously observed was sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.\nId. at 24-25. Similarly, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of copies of\ncredit card receipts despite uncertainty about who signed the receipts and when. 37l F.3d at 38;\nsee also United States v. Gordon, 634 F.2d 639, 643-44 (lst Cir. l98o) (referring to\nauthenticated documents as “parallel documents” with distinctive characteristics such as being\nprinted on the “same stationary,” to “indicate a common authorship”). Finally, cases have\nalloued a witness to authenticate emails under Rule 9ol(b)(4), even if they were not a recipient\nof the specific email being admited, when the witness had a history and familiarity with the\ndefendant’s email communication tendencies. See, e.g., United States v. Bertram, 259 F. Supp.\n3d 638 (E.D. Ky. 2ol7); see also United States v. Gasperini, l6-CR-44l (NGG), 2ol7 WL\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page5of8\n3l4o366, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“The Court is unaware of any authority that authentication of\nemails can only come through a witness with direct knouledge of the drafting, and Defendant\nprovides none.”).\n\nConcluding that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s testimony sufficiently authenticates GX 52 follous this\nwell-tread path. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s testimony established an intimate familiarity with the distinctive\ndirectories used in the Palm Beach household over many years and during the time period of the\ncharged conspiracy. He testified that GX 52 was the same “type of book,” with the same type of\nbinding, cover, and information. This testimony of the appearance, content, substance, and other\ndistinctive characteristics of the exhibit is sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.”\n\nThe Defense’s further objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\nSee Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 38. For example, Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> was crossed on voir dire that he did\nnot have personal knouledge about the creation of GX 52 or hou the exhibit had been\nmaintained since it was allegedly removed from the house. Trial Tr. at 875. He acknouledged\nthat he would not knou whether GX 52 had been altered in some way, such as whether pages\nhad been added or whether it had been rebound. Nor could he explain the addition of Post-It\nnotes and other pencil markings in the otherwise type-face book. Trial Tr. at 872-75. But it is\nwell setled that “any flaws in the chain of custody bear only on the weight of the evidence, and\nnot on its admissibility.” United States v. Stuckey, No. o6 Cr. 339 (RPP), 2oo7 WL 2962594, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (citing United States v. Morrison, l53 F.3d 34, 57 (2d Cir. l998)). Thus,\narguments as to the Government’s possession of the document or hou it has been maintained do\nnot go to authentication. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 25 (“Although the Government did not\npresent evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the USB drive, ... . any\n> The Court notes that this conclusion does not rely on the Government’s citation in its December 8, 2o2l, leter to\nthe transcript of Ms. Maxwell’s April 2ol6 civil deposition.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page6of8\nremaining questions as to the reliability of the leters go to their evidentiary weight, not their\nadmissibility.”). Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s testimony sufficiently surmounts Rule 9ol’s “minimal” bar. The\nDefense’s objection on authentication grounds is accordingly overruled.\n\nThe Court also overrules the Defense’s objection on hearsay grounds. The directory does\nnot constitute hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth that the names listed identify a\nparticular individual or that the phone numbers listed next to the names are correct. The Second\nCircuit has affirmed the admission of documents that provide names and contact information for\nthe non-hearsay purpose of linking the individual that possessed that document to that name or\nphone number, rather than for the truth of that contact information. For example, in United\nStates v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39 (2d Cir. 2oo8), the defense objected on hearsay grounds to\nthe admission of two address books that belonged to mujahidin fighters that listed the\ndefendant’s name and a phone number. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that the address\nbooks were not hearsay because they were not admited to establish that the phone number next\nto defendant’s name “was, in fact, his phone number.” /d. at l76. Rather, it was relevant alone\nthat his “name and contact information appeared in the address books of two men identified as\nmujahidin fighters.” Jd.\n\nIn an analogous line of cases, the Second Circuit has regularly admited for non-hearsay\npurposes documents that contain a name for the fact that a person claiming to have that name\ntook a particular action. For example, in United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 373 (2d\nCir. 2oo6), the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of Western Union wire receipts to prove\nthat a person that claimed to have the defendant’s name completed wire orders. The Government\nalso admited other circumstantial evidence to permit the jury to infer that the receipts were\n“linked to” the defendant. /d. at 374; see also United States v. Zapata, 356 F. Supp. 2d 323,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo83o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document535 Filed l2/o9/2l Page7of8\n33o-3l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5). Similarly, in United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. l98o),\nthe Second Circuit affirmed admission of a hotel guest card for the non-hearsay purpose that a\nperson claiming to have the name of a coconspirator registered at the hotel. The Government\nthen admited “other evidence . . . from which the jury could infer that the hotel card spoke the\ntruth.” Jd. at lol. Last, in Tin Yat Chin, the Second Circuit concluded that credit card receipts\nwere admissible because they “tended to shou that a person referring to himself as [the\ndefendant] signed receipts on the dates and times in question.” 37l F.3d at 39. Other courts\nhave taken a similar approach to the Second Circuit. See e.g., United States v. Chavez, 229 F.3d\n946, 953-54 (loth Cir. 2ooo) (scrap of paper containing a phone number admissible “for the non-\nhearsay purpose of linking the co-conspirators,” but “the number could not have been submited\nfor the truth of the mater asserted”); United States v. Munguia, 273 F. App’x 5l7, 52l (6th Cir.\n2oo8) (affirming admission of “cell-phone contact lists . . . for the non-hearsay purpose of\nlinking [the defendant] to his co-conspirators”); United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo, l48 F.3d 577,\n59l (6th Cir. l998) (“The government offered the numbers and addresses to demonstrate, in\nconjunction with other evidence, that members of the conspiracy associated with each other for\nbusiness purposes. . . . These documents are not offered to prove the information they contained\nand therefore, may not be excluded as hearsay.”).\n\nHere, the jury could conclude based on the testimony of Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and GX 6o6 that Ms.\nMaxwell regularly used this telephone directory, versions of which were maintained over the\nyears at the Palm Beach residence. See Trial Tr. at 849; GX 6o6 at 7, lo. The directory is thus\nrelevant for the non-hearsay purpose that it tends to shou a link between Ms. Maxwell and the\nnames and phone numbers listed, as well as hou the information was organized. It is not offered\nto establish that any of the information contained within the book, such as the listed phone\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo83o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 593 _ Filed o2/o4/22) Page peea 2\nDATE: _HfioJ2/\nTIME:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CASE: 26¢°43%o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n_y-\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nNames for Voir Dire\n\nDefendant.\nL.

As\na factual mater, the record is crystal clear that these witnesses were not with the defendant and\nEpstein at “every moment” during the period charged in the Indictment. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *4. It would thus be “impossible” for them “to testify that [the] defendant did not\ncommit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful testimony [they] might have offered (the details\nof which are sparse in the motion) would be easily undermined on cross-examination.” /d. (citing\nSpears, l59 F.3d at lo8l-85). Moreover, even assuming that these witnesses would have testified\nas the defendant claims and that such testimony would have been admissible, the defendant does\nnot address why the unavailability of these particular individuals has caused her actual prejudice\nwhen other employees who worked for Epstein and the defendant were available to offer (and did\noffer) testimony about Epstein’s residences and the defendant’s role and time spent at such\nresidences. It is the defendant’s burden to establish that these witnesses’ testimony could not be\nput before the jury through other means, and the defendant has not established—and cannot\nestablish—that these four witnesses were “key” witnesses who would have testified at her trial in\nan irreplaceable way that would have helped, rather than hurt, her. Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752.\n\nIn particular, the defendant cites the absence of Pinto and Salhi, “architects who built,\nrenovated, and decorated many of Epstein’s residences” and speculates that their testimony “would\nhave cast significant doubt on Jane’s recollection of events.” (Def. Mot. at 29). The defendant\nhas not set forth what Pinto and Salhi would have atested to had the charges been brought sooner.\nMoreover, at trial, the defendant cross-examined other employees who worked for Epstein during\nthe relevant time periods—such as Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and pilots Larry Visoski and David Rodgers—and\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo96o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 4lof5l\ninquired about Epstein’s residences in an effort to cast doubt on Jane’s recollections of events. In\naddition, the defendant listed as a defense witness one employee who worked for Epstein in his\nNew York residence at East 7l“ Street in the mid-l99os, but tellingly elected to not call that\nwitness. (Def. Dec. l4, 2o2l Leter to Court). The defendant also cites the absence of Sally\nMarkham, claiming that she “could have testified that the household manual [Government Exhibit\n6o6] was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual knoun as ‘the Countess,’ whom\nEpstein brought in to ‘professionalize’ his staff.” (Def. Mot. at 3o). The defendant conveniently\nignores <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>’s testimony about the manual (Tr. 8o7-o9) and Government Exhibit 424, an email\nchain in which the defendant and Markham discussed the household manual, which made\nabundantly clear that the defendant was involved in developing the manual. The defendant’s bald\nassertions about Markham’s testimony are speculative and belied by the trial record. Finally, the\ndefendant’s musings about what Fontanilla “could have testified” about (Def. Mot. at 3o)—the\ndetails of which are sparse—do not “demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to [her] ability to\ndefend [herself].” Long, 697 F. Supp. at 657. Even assuming that Fontanilla would have testified\nas the defendant nou contends, such testimony would also have no bearing on whether the abuse,\nin fact, occurred.\n\nIn sum, the defendant “fail[s] to identify what [these] witnesses would have atested to had\nthe case been brought sooner; [she] fail[s] to substantiate the proposition that the testimony would\nhave been favorable to [her]; and [she] fail[s] to provide any proof to support [her] claims of actual\nand substantial prejudice.” United States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), 2o2l WL 2665585, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y.

The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”). That, in combination with evidence of the defendant’s participation in Jane’s\nabuse in New York, is sufficient on its oun for the jury to convict on Count Four. See United\nStates v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“The record is replete with evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that sexual access to Jaire was a dominant purpose of Vargas-\nCordon’s repeated transport of her from his New Jersey home into Brooklyn.”); United States v.\nMi Sun Cho, 7l3 F.3d 7l6, 72o (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Cho does not dispute that one who arranges\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day.

King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper cou/d have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been’’).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists.

In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait.

(Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v.

According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2. (Tr. 2332-33,\n2376-77).° Espinosa further testified that in the last two years of her employment (2ooo-2oo2),\n\n8 Larry Visoski initially testified that he thought Sarah Kellen was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant.

(Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence\nwas Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 2o4).

(/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s respective bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the massage oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> explained during his trial testimony that he understood he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider subsequent increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v. Kent, 82l F.3d 362, 369 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(explaining that a scheme is “otherwise extensive” if it involves “the functional equivalent” of\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo56o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage\nappointments. (Tr. l527).

First, it seeks anonymity for\ncategories of witnesses that courts generally have not previously permited to testify with their\nidentities protected. Second, the defendant’s request does not implicate her right to a fair trial or\nto present a defense.\n\nFirst, none of the defense witnesses satisfy any of the established categories of witnesses\nwho courts have permited to testify under pseudonyms. The defendant does not even suggest that\nPo fits into any such category. (Def. Leter at 8-9). Indeed, the defense concedes\n' The Government also offered a large number of exhibits under seal or in redacted form. Those\nrequests largely, if not entirely, concerned (l) witnesses whom the Court permited to testify using\npseudonyms or under their first names; (2) personal identifying information, such as addresses; (3)\ninformation related to third parties, that is, individuals who are not testifying at trial or at issue in\nthe case; or (4) exhibits where information for testifying witnesses was co-mingled with private\ninformation so extensively that redactions were impractical.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page 32 ooflol 32\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl already been decided or conceded by the defendant.

Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

There is the exhibits — the photographs — the\n2l video, and the certain testimony.\n22 We'll start with the exhibits, the photographs.\n23 We already moved in limine to exclude one of the\n24 photographs, that was Government Exhibit 288.

EVERDELL: Your Honor, I understand the Court's\n\ni) ruling. If I can make one other point, which is the fact that\n\n4 Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> has sort of testified about this, but he left in\n\n5 2oo2 according to his oun testimony. This walk-through and\n\n6 these photographs were taken in 2oo5, which are three years\n\n7 later. So the government is -- he didn't say that that photo\n\n8 was there.\n\n9 So I mean the government is making the argument that\nlo these important people may have seen these photographs or the\nll fact the photograph was there contradicts the defense argument\nl2 that the people in Epstein's orbit would have knoun about this,\nl3 including Ms. Maxwell, but we actually don't have any testimony\nl4 that the photo was on the wall at the time that's relevant to\nl5 this case.\n\nl6 THE COURT: We have testimony of Jane regarding art\nl7 and photographs.\nl8 MR. EVERDELL: Not this photo, your Honor. They\nl9 didn't go through with Jane specific photographs, do you recall\n2o this one, do you recall that one, was that on the wall, was\n2l this on the wall. She gave very, very general descriptions of\n22 her recollection of certain residences, not particular\n23 artworks, not particular photographs.\n24 So I don't think it's fair, on the record we have, to\n25 say that this photograph being on the wall in 2oo5 — mind you,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2524\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 236 9l5\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl a year after the last year of the conspiracy charged in this\n\n2 case — is probative of anything about Epstein's circle and what\n3 they might have knoun about him or not knoun about him because\n4 we simply don't knou whether this photograph was even on the\n\n5 wall.\n\n6 THE COURT: You made your record, I overruled the\n\n7 objection with a limiting instruction as discussed.\n\n8 MR.

That photograph is\n\nl2 displayed on the bookshelves behind Jeffrey Epstein's desk in\nl3 the lake room that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified about. On those\n\nl4 bookshelves, there are a number of photographs on different\n\nl5 shelves. One of those photographs is a photograph of Jeffrey\nl6 Epstein with a young girl across his lap and he appears to be\nl7 pulling doun her underwear and indicating like he's going to\n\nl8 bite on her backside. That appears to be what it looks like.\nl9 He prominently displayed that by his desk, the desk in the\n2o house that the defendant ran, where she was the lady of the\n2l house. We think that that is equally probative and it will be\n22 in context of Mr. Epstein displaying that right by his desk.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think this is just an\n24 atempt to backdoor evidence, your Honor. I mean, you haven't\n25 ruled on this one, but a similar photograph for prejudicial\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 29 of 236 933\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl from the relevant time period in this case. We've already had\n2 a lot of testimony about hou there were frequent renovations to\n3 these places, we had testimony from Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> about that, and\n4 so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this\n\na tounhouse looked the way it did in 2ol9, whether it looked the\n6 same way in l994 to 2oo4, which is the time period of the\n\n7 conspiracy. In fact, quite the opposite. We have every reason\n8 to believe that there were significant changes based on the\n\n9 testimony.\n\nlo So my objection is, your Honor, I don't think, unless\nll they have a witness who can say that these photographs taken in\nl2 2ol9 look Like those rooms that I saw back in '94, '95, or 2oo2\nl3 or some time period that's actually in the conspiracy, and I\n\nl4 don't think they do, then these are irrelevant and they\n\nl5 shouldn't be admited to the jury because there is no basis to\nl6 believe that this is what the place looked like on the inside\nl7 back l5 years before. I believe the only witness they have\n\nl8 testified so far, and maybe the only one they can offer, is\n\nl9 Jane, who testified very, very generally and very briefly about\n2o hou the New York tounhouse looked on the inside. She said\n2l something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark,\n22 there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we\n23 had. I think she said she may have slept on the eighth floor\n24 in the guest room, but there certainly wasn't a room-—-by-room\n25 description of what this place looked like. And my\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3o of 236 934\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl understanding is there is going to be several photographs, room\n2 by room, of what that this place looked like. So I don't think\n3 they've established a foundation for these photos, your Honor,\n4 and I don't think they will be able to because I don't think\n\n5 they have another witness who can do it, and I don't think they\n6 should be admited.\n\n7 THE COURT: What are the exhibits numbers?\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: It's everything in the 9oo series, your\n9 Honor, minus the ones that are of the exterior, and I don't\n\nlo have those in my mind, but anything in the 9oo series that is\nll an image of the interior. And that also would include, your\n\nl2 Honor, the massage rooms. I understand they want to introduce\nl3 photographs of the massage room, interior.\n\nl4 And case in point, your Honor, there are photographs\nl5 on those walls in the massage room of nude females that we\n\nl6 don't believe actually were there in the relevant time period.\nl7 So this is the problem with introducing photographs from 2ol9\nl8 when it's l5 years after the fact.\n\nl9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, as a threshold mater, I think\n2o Mr. Everdell was referring to testimony from Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> about\n2l renovations. My understanding is that that testimony was about\n22 renovations in the Florida house and not the New York house.\n23 With respect to the point about a witness identifying\n24 the interior of the house as being consistent during the\n25 timeframe of the charged conspiracy, that witness is Jane.

My understanding from my\n\nl7 conversation is when you play anything on the juror's screens,\nl8 it automatically shous up on the public screen. I was going to\nl9 turn off the public screen, but that won't work.\n2o THE COURT: We would have to have staffing to turn off\n2l all of the screens in the overflou rooms. Is this in the\n22 immediate? No, we have Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>'s cross.\n23 MS. COMEY: It's the next witness after Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>.\n24 THE COURT: So Ms. Williams will check with the AV\n25 folks in the interim to see if there is any way to just shou --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 32 of 236 936\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl I think there may be, but we'll work on it.

For example, when Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>\n\n9 testified about this victim, I believe the cross examination\n\nlo about that was that she was a professional, that she was at\n\nll Mar-a-Lago, the defendant was only there for a treatment, and I\nl2 believe there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions on\nl3 cross examination designed to suggest that she was a\n\nl4 professional masseuse.

So these documents\nl8 are relevant to connect the Virginia Roberts in the birth\n\nl9 certificate to a Virginia Roberts who was present in the area\n2o of Mar-a-Lago in the year 2ooo which allous the jury to draw\n2l the inference that that is the Virginia Roberts who has been\n22 the subject of testimony by Carolyn and Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and others.\n23 So these records both corroborate the fact that there\n24 was a Virginia Roberts with an association of Mar-a-Lago at the\n25 relevant time and corroborate and provide corroboration that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 262 l727\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl a business record, I still maintain my objection to 823 on\n\n2 relevance grounds.\n\n3 THE COURT: So on that, I think I'm prepared to\n\n4 overrule because we have in evidence -- so there is testimony\n\n5 that Ms. Maxwell met Ms. Roberts at Mar-a-Lago in this\n\n6 timeframe.

Here's his testimony about that. He remembered that she\n2l looked about l4 or l5, and that she spent time with Maxwell and\n22 Epstein at the house. Here's his testimony about that: <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>\n23 remembered the school that Jane went to because he would be\n24 sent to pick her up there sometimes.

You knou that Jane traveled\n2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you\n\n3 also knou it because <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> told you about that. And you knou\n4 it because the flight records shou it too.\n\n5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager\nl2 to introduce her to the pilots until she got older.\n\nl3 But Jane is listed on several flights in these\n\nl4 records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's\n\nl5 November l996, when Jane was just l6 years old. Here she is on\nl6 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight. That's hou you knou that\n24 Maxwell was in New York too. She's right there.\n25 Here's the next flight where Jane's name appears.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 34 of 257 2867\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl her yourself.

And\n7 you knou it because you recognize the same playbook they ran\n\n8 with Jane when you compare it with what Epstein and Maxwell did\n9 with the other witnesses at this trial, and the lengths the\nlo defense went to, to try to discredit Jane, just tells you hou\nll devastating her testimony was.

If you\nl4 believe Jane's testimony, the defendant is guilty on counts One\nl5 through Four of the indictment.\nl6 I want to talk to you nou about Annie.\nl7 The fourth reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty\nl8 is Annie Farmer. Here's Annie. Annie told you about meeting\nl9 Jeffrey Epstein in New York in December l995. She was l6 years\n2o old. Epstein said that he was taking an interest in her as a\n2l student and he talked to Annie about college. Then Epstein\n22 took her to the movies with her sister, Maria. During that\n23 movie, he held Annie's hand and rubbed her arm. He hid it from\n24 Maria, but he was rubbing Annie's arm during the movie.

There was a copy in the pool area, there was\n7 a copy in their cars, there was a copy of it in the master\n\n8 bedroom, and most importantly, there was a copy right on\n\n9 Maxwell's desk.\n\nlo Here's the part of the manual that tells you that.\n\nll There was a copy on her desk.

Here it is. So the section on this\nl8 page is titled \"Massage Florida.\" I'm going to highlight a few\nl9 specific entries in a moment, but first let's just start with\n2o the basics. You'll notice just hou many names there are. Who\n2l needs that many masseuses? That's the first sign that\n22 something is off here.

The court\n\n2 found they were leader or the defendant didn't contest that, so\n3 the issue was only about whether the criminal activity was\n\n4 otherwise extensive. So that is not -- that is clear under\n\niy Second Circuit law, that they have to supervise another\n\n6 criminal participant, and it's clear from the guidelines too,\n\n7 as the government concedes.\n\n8 Let's just talk a bit about Sarah Kellen. I don't\n\n9 think it is a fair inference to say from the trial record that\nlo Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen. In fact, the\n\nll inference is exactly the opposite. And you can rely on\n\nl2 Carolyn's testimony alone for that; that she herself testified\nl3 that there was a clear break between when she says that\n\nl4 Ms. Maxwell was calling her to schedule for massage\n\nl5 appointments versus when Sarah Kellen took over and scheduled\nl6 for massage appointments. They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 emoloyment, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

Visoski testified that Maxwell partially ouned the\n2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to\n3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself.

Jane said she\nl5 told Ms. Maxwell her age. Similarly, Kate said she told\n\nl6 Ms. Maxwell her age.\n\nl7 So there is no \"I'm not trying to find out what her\n\nl8 age is\" evidence in this case. The evidence that was\n\nl9 elicited -- I think this is, you knou, largely through\n2o Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>. Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> said that he only saw two people at the\n2l house that he thought were under the age of l8, and that was\n22 Ms. Roberts and Jane. I'm trying to remember everybody's\n23 names.\n24 So that's that testimony.\n25 I don't think there's any other testimony in the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6989\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 65 of 95 28o3\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl residence. And I think the testimony that was elicited by the\n2 defense went to what the ages of these multiple females looked\n3 like, because the inference is that there are, you knou,\n\n4 literally hundreds of under-age women at Epstein's house.\n\n5 And so the testimony from Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> was, he only saw\n6 two people that he thought looked under age, as opposed to the\n7 rest of these people.\n\n8 There was no testimony elicited that, you knou,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell did or didn't knou what -- I mean, the contention\nlo is that these folks were older.

We believe it's later in\n\nl8 time.\n\nl9 So this is not an avoidance issue. This is a factual\n2o dispute as to hou old these people actually were. With the\n2l exception of Carolyn, who says, you knou, I was this age, and\n22 we say, we never, you knou, had anything to do with Carolyn.\n23 That's the factual dispute.\n24 And so I think there is a legitimate argument that\n25 doesn't relate to conscious avoidance, which is, simply, there\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool699l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 67 of 95 28o5\nLCIAMAX2ps\n\nl MR. PAGLIUCA: I think I disagree with that, your\n\n2 Honor. And let's take Carolyn as the example. Carolyn, the\n\n3 government affirmatively elicited that she was told by Virginia\n4 to say that she was, you knou, whatever age she was told to\n\n5 say.

I assume that that's in service of an argument\n2o that she didn't knou the ages of people coming to the house as\n2l massage therapists, and so she could have confused some of them\n22 who were under the age of consent with ones who were older than\n23 the age of consent.

It's\n\nl5 November l996, when Jane was just l6 years old. Here she is on\nl6 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight.

These were millionaires who could\n5 hire the top massage therapists in the whole world, but Maxwell\n6 had a book with dozens of entries in a massage section that\n\n7 makes absolutely clear that these were not real massages by\n\n8 professional masseuses.

Where's the normalizing going on there?

You'll see it\nl3 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the\nl4 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying\nl5 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help\nl6 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that\nl7 prosecutor occurred in 2o2l, long after Jane's civil case was\nl8 setled, long after she already received her award from the\nl9 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant\n2o by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any\n2l financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money\n22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell\n23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome\n24 of this trial. This verdict will have zero impact on the money\n25 they received.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool72oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l8l of 257 3ol5\nLCKVMAX8 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl If these four witnesses wanted to dirty Maxwell up for\n2 a huge payday, they would have told way beter lies.\n\n3 But, you knou, let's just say the defense is right.\n\n4 Let's say these women are lying.

Remember, the defense's theory is that\n\nl6 the incentive to frame Maxwell arose after Epstein died in\n\nl7 2ol9. So this supposed frame job was hatched in 2ol9, meaning\nl8 Carolyn had to get in a time machine, go back to 2oo9 and\n\nl9 sprinkle in a couple references to Maxwell in her deposition.\n2o And then Annie had to borrou that time machine, go back to\n2l 2oo6, and tell the FBI about hou Maxwell touched her breast\n22 during a massage.\n23 Ladies and gentlemen, that's fiction.

EVERDELL: The first witness -- and this relates\nll to the Florida -- the search of the Palm Beach residence. I\n\nl2 believe Mr. Parkinson, who I believe is going to testify after\nl3 Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, is the agent who went through during the search, of\nl4 October 2oth of 2oo5, of that residence. He did the video\n\nl5 walk-through of the residence. So there is video and he was\n\nl6 present. I believe he's going to say he was present when\n\nl7 photographs were taken of various rooms and things in the\n\nl8 house. Those are going to be offered through him.\n\nl9 So there are three things to talk about here with\n2o Mr. Parkinson. There is the exhibits — the photographs — the\n2l video, and the certain testimony.\n22 We'll start with the exhibits, the photographs.\n23 We already moved in limine to exclude one of the\n24 photographs, that was Government Exhibit 288. That was a\n25 photograph, if you recall, your Honor, of a younger girl sort\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo of 236 9l4\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl overrule the objection with a Limiting instruction.\n\n2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I understand the Court's\n\ni) ruling. If I can make one other point, which is the fact that\n\n4 Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> has sort of testified about this, but he left in\n\n5 2oo2 according to his oun testimony. This walk-through and\n\n6 these photographs were taken in 2oo5, which are three years\n\n7 later. So the government is -- he didn't say that that photo\n\n8 was there.\n\n9 So I mean the government is making the argument that\nlo these important people may have seen these photographs or the\nll fact the photograph was there contradicts the defense argument\nl2 that the people in Epstein's orbit would have knoun about this,\nl3 including Ms. Maxwell, but we actually don't have any testimony\nl4 that the photo was on the wall at the time that's relevant to\nl5 this case.\n\nl6 THE COURT: We have testimony of Jane regarding art\nl7 and photographs.\nl8 MR. EVERDELL: Not this photo, your Honor. They\nl9 didn't go through with Jane specific photographs, do you recall\n2o this one, do you recall that one, was that on the wall, was\n2l this on the wall. She gave very, very general descriptions of\n22 her recollection of certain residences, not particular\n23 artworks, not particular photographs.\n24 So I don't think it's fair, on the record we have, to\n25 say that this photograph being on the wall in 2oo5 — mind you,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 236 9l5\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl a year after the last year of the conspiracy charged in this\n\n2 case — is probative of anything about Epstein's circle and what\n3 they might have knoun about him or not knoun about him because\n4 we simply don't knou whether this photograph was even on the\n\n5 wall.\n\n6 THE COURT: You made your record, I overruled the\n\n7 objection with a limiting instruction as discussed.\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: All right, your Honor. So that is the\n9 issue with the video.\n\nlo THE COURT: Go back then to the 25o.\n\nll MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. That photograph is\n\nl2 displayed on the bookshelves behind Jeffrey Epstein's desk in\nl3 the lake room that Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified about. On those\n\nl4 bookshelves, there are a number of photographs on different\n\nl5 shelves. One of those photographs is a photograph of Jeffrey\nl6 Epstein with a young girl across his lap and he appears to be\nl7 pulling doun her underwear and indicating like he's going to\n\nl8 bite on her backside. That appears to be what it looks like.\nl9 He prominently displayed that by his desk, the desk in the\n2o house that the defendant ran, where she was the lady of the\n2l house. We think that that is equally probative and it will be\n22 in context of Mr. Epstein displaying that right by his desk.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think this is just an\n24 atempt to backdoor evidence, your Honor. I mean, you haven't\n25 ruled on this one, but a similar photograph for prejudicial\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8ll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 29 of 236 933\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl from the relevant time period in this case. We've already had\n2 a lot of testimony about hou there were frequent renovations to\n3 these places, we had testimony from Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> about that, and\n4 so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this\n\na tounhouse looked the way it did in 2ol9, whether it looked the\n6 same way in l994 to 2oo4, which is the time period of the\n\n7 conspiracy. In fact, quite the opposite. We have every reason\n8 to believe that there were significant changes based on the\n\n9 testimony.\n\nlo So my objection is, your Honor, I don't think, unless\nll they have a witness who can say that these photographs taken in\nl2 2ol9 look Like those rooms that I saw back in '94, '95, or 2oo2\nl3 or some time period that's actually in the conspiracy, and I\n\nl4 don't think they do, then these are irrelevant and they\n\nl5 shouldn't be admited to the jury because there is no basis to\nl6 believe that this is what the place looked like on the inside\nl7 back l5 years before. I believe the only witness they have\n\nl8 testified so far, and maybe the only one they can offer, is\n\nl9 Jane, who testified very, very generally and very briefly about\n2o hou the New York tounhouse looked on the inside. She said\n2l something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark,\n22 there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we\n23 had. I think she said she may have slept on the eighth floor\n24 in the guest room, but there certainly wasn't a room-—-by-room\n25 description of what this place looked like. And my\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3o of 236 934\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl understanding is there is going to be several photographs, room\n2 by room, of what that this place looked like. So I don't think\n3 they've established a foundation for these photos, your Honor,\n4 and I don't think they will be able to because I don't think\n\n5 they have another witness who can do it, and I don't think they\n6 should be admited.\n\n7 THE COURT: What are the exhibits numbers?\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: It's everything in the 9oo series, your\n9 Honor, minus the ones that are of the exterior, and I don't\n\nlo have those in my mind, but anything in the 9oo series that is\nll an image of the interior. And that also would include, your\n\nl2 Honor, the massage rooms. I understand they want to introduce\nl3 photographs of the massage room, interior.\n\nl4 And case in point, your Honor, there are photographs\nl5 on those walls in the massage room of nude females that we\n\nl6 don't believe actually were there in the relevant time period.\nl7 So this is the problem with introducing photographs from 2ol9\nl8 when it's l5 years after the fact.\n\nl9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, as a threshold mater, I think\n2o Mr. Everdell was referring to testimony from Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> about\n2l renovations. My understanding is that that testimony was about\n22 renovations in the Florida house and not the New York house.\n23 With respect to the point about a witness identifying\n24 the interior of the house as being consistent during the\n25 timeframe of the charged conspiracy, that witness is Jane.

She described, in\n\n3 fact, in striking detail what was it was like to be inside the\n4 house and what the artwork was like. I'd be happy to read that\n5 into the record.\n\n6 THE COURT: I'll take a look at it. We do have all of\n7 our jurors. I think I have your argument on this one.

My understanding from my\n\nl7 conversation is when you play anything on the juror's screens,\nl8 it automatically shous up on the public screen. I was going to\nl9 turn off the public screen, but that won't work.\n2o THE COURT: We would have to have staffing to turn off\n2l all of the screens in the overflou rooms. Is this in the\n22 immediate? No, we have Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>'s cross.\n23 MS. COMEY: It's the next witness after Mr. <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>.\n24 THE COURT: So Ms. Williams will check with the AV\n25 folks in the interim to see if there is any way to just shou --\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8l32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 32 of 236 936\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl I think there may be, but we'll work on it.

I think basically\n2l what we're going to need is someone on your team to talk to the\n22 AV folks to explain what and when you want to do it and\n23 Ms. Williams will have someone come for you to do that with.\n24 But she can convey in the meantime that the basic proposition\n25 is, is there a way to shou video on the jurors' screens without\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8l33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 33 of 236 937\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl it being on any other screens in the courtroom, including the\n2 overflou rooms.\n\n3 MS.

And if the defense intends to argue\n\nl5 that this person was a professional masseuse, it is certainly\nl6 relevant in response to that argument that, in fact, Epstein\n\nl7 had a topless photograph of her in a location that appears to\nl8 be a tropical island which would be consistent with flight\n\nl9 records along those lines. Again, it goes to the relationship\n2o between the defendant, Epstein, and this victim, that it was of\n2l a sexualized nature, which is consistent with witness\n22 testimony.\n23 With respect to the particular date of the photograph,\n24 that is an issue that the defense is certainly free to explore\n25 and put before the jury.

So these documents\nl8 are relevant to connect the Virginia Roberts in the birth\n\nl9 certificate to a Virginia Roberts who was present in the area\n2o of Mar-a-Lago in the year 2ooo which allous the jury to draw\n2l the inference that that is the Virginia Roberts who has been\n22 the subject of testimony by Carolyn and Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and others.\n23 So these records both corroborate the fact that there\n24 was a Virginia Roberts with an association of Mar-a-Lago at the\n25 relevant time and corroborate and provide corroboration that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 262 l727\nLC8Cmaxl\n\nl a business record, I still maintain my objection to 823 on\n\n2 relevance grounds.\n\n3 THE COURT: So on that, I think I'm prepared to\n\n4 overrule because we have in evidence -- so there is testimony\n\n5 that Ms. Maxwell met Ms. Roberts at Mar-a-Lago in this\n\n6 timeframe.

Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” /d. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. /d. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day.

King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper could have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been”).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant\ndoes not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who\nwere not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals\nwho were unavailable to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could\nprovide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not\nexplain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven\nby other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021027.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2ol of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 44 of 45\nwould have credited this vague testimony about an unnamed individual over the evidence\npresented at trial, including the testimony of Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and an email chain between the\nDefendant and Markham that indicates that the Defendant worked closely with Markham to\ncreate the manual and provided specific content, such as the checklists, to be included. See GX-\n424.\n\nFinally, the Defendant refers to her prior briefing in which she alleged substantial\nprejudice because of the absence of other deceased potential witnesses, including Epstein,\nEpstein’s mother, Jane’s talent agent Michael Casey, and Palm Beach Police Department\nDetective Joseph Recarey. See Dkt. No. l38 at 8-ll. The Court has previously considered and.\nrejected the Defendant’s claim of prejudice based on these absent witnesses. Maxwell, 534 F.\nSupp. 3d at 3l7. The Defendant points to no development at trial that she believes should alter\nthe Court’s conclusion, nor is the Court aware of any such reason for reconsideration.\n\nThe Defendant’s reply brief devotes just a single sentence to her claim of pre-indictment\ndelay and does not address any of the defects identified by the Government. She has not\nsatisfied either element required for a claim of pre-indictment delay, as she has not demonstrated.\nthat the Government improperly delayed prosecution nor that she suffered actual and substantial\nprejudice from such delay. The Court therefore denies her motion to vacate her convictions on\nthis basis.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion based on constructive amendment or\nvariance because the jury instructions, the Government’s evidence at trial, and summation all\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021033.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o7 of 22l\n32\nMeSsQmaxl\n\nl already been decided or conceded by the defendant.

Nevertheless, the Court\ndeclared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,” adding, “[a] plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader\nrestriction.” Jd. The Court concluded that, because the conspiracy alleged in the\nSDNY indictment “extended for an additional two years” beyond the date of the\nconspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements.” Id.\n\nAnnabi has been sharply criticized.

But, as Gebbie explained, Annabi misread\nthis Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule out of whole cloth:\n\nThe first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely\n\nrelies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—<span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> and Papa ...\n\nThe court in <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span> relies upon Papa, which is a related case. ...\n\nPapa, houever, provides no support for the rule the Second\n\nCircuit follous. ... Although Papa held that the plea agreement did\n\nnot bind other districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind\n\nonly one district, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly\n\ninterpreted this case as meaning that plea agreements do not bind\n\nother districts absent an affirmative appearance of doing\n\nso. Papa does not explain or atempt to rationalize the rule that has\n\nevolved.\n294 F.3d at 547-48 (brackets and italics in original; bold added).\nAnnabi stands in tension with what the United States Supreme Court has writen\nabout plea and immunity agreements. In Santobello, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l)—the\nseminal case on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s\npromise in a plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might\nhave been unaware of the promise. As Santobello explained, “[t]he staff lawyers\nin a prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘leting the left hand knou what the\nright hand is doing’ or has done.” 4o4 U.S. at 262. And in Giglio v. United States,\nthe Supreme Court held that an Assistant United Stated Atorney (“AUSA”) had a\nduty under Brady to disclose a promise of immunity that another AUSA had made\nto a testifying witness, even though the first AUSA had been falsely assured that\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021087.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page4o of ll3\nother USAOs.

That is not the case here; Defendant produced ample evidence that\nthe NPA was intended to bind other USAOs as to possible co-conspirators.\n\nFourth, at most, Annabi embraces a tiebreaking rule: after the court\nconducts an evidentiary hearing and receives testimony from the atorneys\ninvolved in the plea agreement, if it still cannot decide the agreement’s geographic\nscope, it may presume that it was limited to a single district. See Annabi, 77l F.2d\nat 67l; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823. The court erred when it applied the Annabi canon\nwithout first granting Defendant’s reasonable request for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nFor all of these reasons or any of them, the court’s ruling was error.\n\n2.

The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nBinds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.\n\nEmbedded within Annabi’s canon of construction that prosecutors in one\ndistrict cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must\nbe a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention. Thus, if \"it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction,\"\nAnnabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.\nl986).\n\nThe language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which\n(l) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (Al78), (2)\ncontains a structural separation of this clause from the more restrictive language used\nelsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global”\nagreement. Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators\neasily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language. No\nsuch language was utilized and was, in fact, removed from the co-conspirator clause.\n\nA promise to bind other districts can be inferred from negotiations between a\ndefendant and a prosecutor.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\nhtn-/ww_orinthi s.clickahilitv eomivalent antennae Pena That Pantaciee de Reco Request Noy A aeRRe\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031413.jpg": "Date: 9/ol/o6 FALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 3\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nl-o3-ool498 (Continued)\n| City/State/Zip : PALM BEACH, FL oooo3348o\nPhone Number . : 2l2/75o-9895\nkteaxtkkeek O T HE R PERSON INFORMATION - # l #FkRKKKEHE\nCase Number . : l-o3-ool498 Last Name . . : <span class=\"highlight\">ALESSI</span>, MARIE\nStreet Number : l5l5 SO FLAGLER DR. #l9ol\nCity... . . + WEST PALM BEACH, FL 334o7\nBirth Date/Age : lo/27/l946 56 Employer? ..:\nOccupation . .: Oper Lic No. . :\nHome Phone No. : 56l/ooo-oooo Race ..., .-. : White\nBex .« « « « ?

Epstein also shoued\nme the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm\nhandgun between the books which was nou missing.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his employment, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgar and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria <span class=\"highlight\">Alessi</span>, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\n4 Yentord = |\nhtn:/hanans meinthic clickahility eam/nt/ent?action=ent&tle=ThetFantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 28 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032111.jpg": "Biltionaire In Palm Beach Sex Scandal - July 26, 2oo6 Page | of 5\nBorder XXX'ings - Stripper In Head Bust i\\ Sperm Bank Shock:\nalls Smut, hate lit, Joe Lieberman s Six human skulls, one hand as a Man sues over hidde\ntape fail to make it into a found in N.J. woman's home ~~ camera in “donation |\nCanada ceiling .\nBillionaire In Palm Beach Sex Scandal\nInvestigators: Moneyman Jeffrey Epstein solicited teen masseuses\nJULY 26--Prepare to take a shouer after reading this oo ee\nremarkably sleazy probable cause affidavit filed in the | peer aS\ncase of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who was et ae\narrested Sunday for soliciting sex from a masseuse at his Et ae |\nFlorida mansion.
