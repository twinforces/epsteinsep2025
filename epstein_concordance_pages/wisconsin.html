Have you testified in civil cases?\n\nl3 A. Yes.\n\nl4 Q. Have you testified for both the plaintiff and the defense?\nl5 A. Many times, yes.\n\nl6 Q. In connection with criminal cases, is it fair to say that\nl7 the majority, if not most, of your testimony is for the\n\nl8 defense; correct?\n\nl9 A. Well, I've only been asked to consult with the prosecution\n2o maybe five or six times. But of those five or six times I've\n2l consulted, only one time did the prosecution actually request\n22 my testimony at trial; and I did testify for the prosecution in\n23 that one case in <span class=\"highlight\">Wisconsin</span>.\n24 Q.
