This should\nsatisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets\nunrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at l7-l8).\n\nIn addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submited twelve pretrial\nmotions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or\nall of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail\napplication (see Dkt. l8 at l9) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the\nchance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of\nJanuary 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.\n\nMs. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She\nhas been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has\npoisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly\natacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have\nneither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an atempt\nto turn her into a substitute <span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span> for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —\nand welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional\nproposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should\ntherefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool235", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001288.jpg": "Caseel27 o/o o8BoHAEN 2ADdtuUMAEht /L59 l Filecsad 672g ePagePl6k3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\n<span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span>. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool288", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 6 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the <span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span>\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a <span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span> set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthat the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts\nare already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.\n\nSecond, the Defense Leter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the\nGovernment’s control, but that the Government has nevertheless spent significant time addressing\nat the defense’s behest.

Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue.

As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine.

It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible.

He said a new cellmate could have been\nreassigned before the 4 p.m. SHU count if it was knoun that Inmate 3 was not coming back, but the SHU\nstaff members had until Epstein returned from his atorney visit to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nAccording to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, SHU staff definitely should have realized that Inmate 3\nwas not returning both during the 4 p.m. count and when Epstein returned from his atorney visit later that\nevening. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine was that he would\nbe with his atorneys in the atorney conference room until approximately 8 p.m., so SHU personnel had\ntime to make a new cellmate assignment. He said all SHU staff members shared the responsibility to find a\n<span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span> cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found another inmate to replace\nInmate 3. Houever, he also said that due to Epstein’s high profile, the SHU personnel should have asked a\nLieutenant to contact the Psychology Department to see which inmate should be placed with Epstein.\nOn August l2, 2ol9, follouing Epstein’s death, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge wrote a memorandum\nto the Warden stating, “On Friday August 9, 2ol9 at approximately l:5o p.m., | S/O/S [the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge] passed on to oncoming staff member [the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge] and\npresent shift staff [Senior Officer Specialist 5] and [CO 2] that Inmate [3] was going WAB [i-e., with all of his\nbelongings] and possibly may not return. Also that Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 will be needing a cell mate\nupon arrival from his atorney visit.” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge departed the SHU at\napproximately 2 p.m. and worked an overtime shift as a driver for MCC New York.

The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge\nand CO l, houever, were the only two MCC New York staff members working the Day Watch on August 9,\n2ol9, who told the OIG that they were aware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new\ncellmate. CO l’s immediate superior (the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge) was already aware of the need\nto assign Epstein a new cellmate. While the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he made a\nnumber of notifications, other witnesses could not confirm that he had passed on information regarding\nEpstein’s need for a new cellmate.\n\n54\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2342l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg": "the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift\nended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the <span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span> hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, Correctional\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the institution the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera <span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span> project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for <span class=\"highlight\">replacement</span> camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029048.jpg": "(Rev. o5-ol-2oo8) @ ®@\n.
