September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.”°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””8 Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”*?? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein. Villafafia told OPR\nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be\noad Villafafia had assured Lefkouitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would\nremain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n228 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\nad Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of... . and they did. Hou. . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nSean to call AK back and let her knou if the Florida agents had concerns.

September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.””°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOJA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””° Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”°°? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”*°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... J am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein. Villafafia told OPR\nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be\noad Villafafia had assured Lefkouitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would\nremain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n228 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\nad Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of... . and they did. Hou. . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 344 Filed lo/l4/2l Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ik\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCUMENT\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: lo/l4/2l __j]\nUnited States of America, =\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the government’s leter motion, dated November ll, 2o2l, requesting that the Court find that\nthe birth certificates for the alleged Minor Victims (GX-ll through GX-l6) are self-authenticating\nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nWe have reviewed the government’s submission and, in the interests of facilitating an\nefficient trial, we are prepared to stipulate to the authenticity of the birth certificates for alleged\nMinor Victim-l (GX-l2), Minor Victim-2 (GX-l3), Minor Victim-4 (GX-ll), Minor Victim-5\n(GX-l4), and Minor Victim-6 (GX-l5). We will <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> with the government to produce an\nappropriately worded stipulation as to the authenticity of these exhibits.\n\nHouever, the government itself concedes that it has not yet proffered a sufficient\nfoundation to authenticate the birth certificate of Witness-3 (GX-l6). See ll/ll/2o2l Gov’t Ltr. at\nln.2. According to GX-l6, Witness-3 was born i In order for such a\nrecord to be self-authenticating as a foreign public document, the government must meet the\nrequirements of Rule 9o2(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which it has not yet done.

Nathan\nJanuary 25, 2o22\nPage 2\n\nI waive my right to anonymity. I am doing this because I want all young women to\n\nknou what happened to me when I was a teenager and hou it has affected my life.\n\nI want to be a voice for all survivors of sexual abuse so that they are not afraid to\n\ncome forward, even if it is years after the event, and say what happened to them.\n\nThis is my story and I want to tell it.!\n\nThe defense told the government that, in light of Ms. Andriano’s statements, we did not\nsee any privacy interest that could justify redacting her name in any further court filings.\nAlthough we did not receive a response from the government, the government ultimately sent the\nCourt a proposed redacted version of Court Exhibit 2 which redacted the full names of witnesses\nwho testified under pseudonyms and the last names of witnesses who testified using only their first\nnames. The government also folloued the defense’s request and did not redact Ms. Andriano’s\nlast name.\n\nCarolyn Andriano is nou in the same position as Annie Farmer, who publicly waived her\nright to anonymity and gave public statements to the media under her full name. Accordingly, the\ndefense respectfully submits that Ms. Andriano’s last name should not be redacted in the version\nof Court Exhibit 2 that is filed on the public docket.\n\nThe defense files this leter temporarily under seal until the Court rules on whether Ms.\nAndriano’s last name should be redacted. Once the Court rules, we will file an appropriately\nredacted version of this leter on the public docket and <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> with the government to provide\nthe Court with an updated version of Court Exhibit 2, if necessary.\n\nSee htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo38o3l3/Victim-waives-claims-Virginia-Giuffre-told-slept-Duke-\nYork-London.html (emphasis added).\n2o86l75.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo885o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 63l Filed o3/o3/22 Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT [coe =\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCUMENT\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nUnited States of America, DATE FO: SlS/ee\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.”*”? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”3°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... Iam meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein.

It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n298 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\n2a Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of. ... and they did. Hou... they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no .. . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021474.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 398 3536o39, Page44 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022569.tif": "Page l77\nl blackmail.

September — October 2oo7: The Case Agents Notify Some Victims about the\nNPA, but Stop When the Case Agent Becomes Concerned about Potential\nImpeachment\n\nIn transmiting the signed NPA to Villafafia on September 24, 2oo7, defense atorney\nLefkouitz asked Villafafia to “do whatever you can to prevent [the NPA] from becoming\npublic.””°’ Villafafia forwarded this email to Acosta, Lourie, and the new West Palm Beach\nmanager noting that, “I don’t intend to do anything with it except put it in the case file.” Acosta\nresponded that he “thought the [NPA] already binds us not to make [it] public except as required\nby law or [FOIA]” and noted that because the USAO would not proactively inform the media\nabout the NPA, “this is the State Atorney[’]s shou.”””° Acosta added, “In other words, what more\ndoes he want?” Villafafia responded, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief\nor FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Lourie agreed, noting that “there really is\nno reason to tell anyone all the details of the non pros or provide a copy. The [PBPD] Chief was\nonly concerned that he not get surprised by all this.””? Acosta responded that he would set up a\ncall on September 26, 2oo7, to talk “about who we can tell and hou much.”°°°\n\nAlso on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed the new West Palm Beach manager to\ninform him that once the atorney representative was appointed for the victims, she planned to\n“meet with the girls myself to explain hou the system [for obtaining relief under l8 U.S.C. § 2255]\nwill work.” Villafafia also emailed Lefkouitz stating that she planned to discuss with him “what\nI can tell [the atorney representative] and the girls about the agreement,” and she assured\nLefkouitz that her office “is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.” Villafafia\nalso provided Lefkouitz with a list of potential candidates for the atorney representative position\nand advocated for an atorney representative who would minimize press coverage of the mater.\n\nOn September 26, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Lefkouitz to request guidance on informing the\nvictims about the NPA: “Can you give me a call... I am meeting with the agents and want to\ngive them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls.” Villafafia told OPR that\nbecause the government and the defense had not agreed on the atorney representative for the\nvictims, she reached out to the defense at the direction of either Acosta or Sloman in order to\n<span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> hou to inform the victims about the resolution of the case and the fact that there would\nbe an atorney to assist them in recovering monetary damages from Epstein. Villafafia told OPR\nthat the defense responded to her email by complaining to her supervisors that she should not be\n297 Villafafia had assured Lefkouitz that the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would\nremain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would\ndistribute without compulsory process.”\n298 Acosta told OPR that he believed that the NPA “would see the light of day” because the victims would have\nto “hear about [their § 2255 rights] from somewhere” and “given the press interest, eventually this would be FOTA’d.”\n299 Lourie told OPR that the § 2255 provisions of the NPA “that benefited the victims were there for the victims\nto take advantage of... . and they did. Hou. . . they were going to receive that information and when they were going\nto receive it is a different question, but there’s no . . . issue with the fact that they were going to get that information.”\n3oo OPR was unable to determine whether the call took place.\n\n2o7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023310.tif": "argued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023419.jpg": "Epstein, and he said he told the second atorney that Epstein could not be housed without a cellmate\nbecause of his prior suicide atempt.\nC. Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York\nAccording to MCC New York reports, including the Daily Log and the Lieutenant’s Log, on August 9, 2ol9, at\napproximately 8:38 a.m., Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-removed” and transferred out of MCC\nNew York in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log tracks inmate movements throughout MCC\nNew York each day, while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily\nactivities that took place within the institution during their respective shifts.\nThe Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,\n2ol9, and was responsible for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The\nSupervisory Correctional Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the Correctional Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The Correctional Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience. Receiving and\nDischarge personnel would have printed copies of the call out list for August 9, 2ol9, which the MCC\nNew York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the\nother records reflecting Inmate 3's transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer said the call out list created for\nAugust 9, 2ol9, would have listed “WAB” next to Inmate 3’s name, which meant that he was departing from\nthe institution and not returning.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) l told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, he and Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025125.jpg": "Page 763\nAll staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the\nstaff suicide watch.

In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search.

Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

With regard to the depositions of our clients, it is necessary and\nappropriate for the entry of a court order which would require that one deposition be taken of\neach of our clients for use in both the criminal case and the civil case. A single deposition is\nwarranted given that the facts of the sexual assault are common to both the civil and criminal\ncases, and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is the same in both cases. A single deposition is in the\nbest interests of the emotional well being of the victim. In another case we were involved in\nwhere both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Atorney’s office filed a\nmotion for protective order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(l)(l) asking that\nthe depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time.\n\nWe would like to <span class=\"highlight\">coordinate</span> and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue\nconceming the depositions of our clients.
