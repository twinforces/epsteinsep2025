SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000854.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagel5 of 24\n\nl2/o4/2o2o | 85 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000892.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagel6 of 25\n\nl2/o4/2o2o | 85 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\n<span class=\"highlight\">counsel's</span> decision and not the court's.

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\n<span class=\"highlight\">counsel's</span> decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009925.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN name r= Om FAD RSA Pn Petey 2a f 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M, DAUGERDAS, ET AL., February l5, 2ol2\nC2FFDAU4 Conrad - direct Pages l29 | C2FFDAU4 Conrad - direct Page l3l\nl MR.

And for that reason, we would\n\nl6 respectfully request that the Court give a curative\n\nl7 instruction, essentially in reminding the jurors that it's\n\nl8 their recollection of the evidence that controls and not what\nl9 the lawyers say.\n2o I think, in particular, there is one example, I\nal believe Ms. Menninger read into the record an email from Kate\n22 which the Court expressly precluded and which is not in\n23 evidence.\n24 THE COURT: What exhibit?\n25 MS.

That's why we're\n2l requesting it nou, although I understand the Court's point that\n22 the jury will be charged this afternoon and that language is in\n23 the charge.\n24 The second issue that we wanted to raise is, as the\n25 Court will recall from pretrial litigation, we moved to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l6 of 264 422\nLClVMAXl\n\nl narroued the scope of any disagreement.\n\n2 There are two remaining topics.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019708.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagel5 of l9\n\nl2/o4/2o2o | 85 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019810.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagel5 of 24\n\nl2/o4/2o2o | 85 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on <span class=\"highlight\">counsel's</span> representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense <span class=\"highlight\">counsel's</span> May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense <span class=\"highlight\">counsel's</span> May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Nathan on\n3/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on <span class=\"highlight\">counsel's</span> representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5 minutes at night.\nDkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.

As you likely knou, the\ngovernment had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge\nBerman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the\ngovernment and defense counsel a chance to speak.\nMost importantly, defense counsel stated they were \"all for finding out the truth!\" To that end, they asked\nJudge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent\nauthority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is\nimportant. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)\nconcerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense\ncounsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a\nparticular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel\nobviously didn't knou that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go\nto SHU.)\nVarious atorneys for the victims spoke, too.
