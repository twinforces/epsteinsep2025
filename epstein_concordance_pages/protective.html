Notably, the privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance are\nsubstantially diminished due to Epstein’s death. Of course, as noted above, the Department of\nJustice will work with the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\nto redact all victim-identifying information prior to any release.\n\n6. For these reasons, this Court should conclude that the Epstein and Maxwell cases\nqualify as a mater of public interest, release the associated grand jury transcripts, and lift any\npreexisting <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders.

The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp. 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nCase No: l9 CR 49o (RMB)\nPage 3\n\nIl. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public.

As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> of the rights of third parties.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-Oooooll75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001176.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagpecd 4 Ob 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001177.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD IZocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGecdS Ob 36\nother inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001316.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 38, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o7529l, Page2 of 3\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nwee ee ew ew ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee eee ee x\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : AFFIRMATION\nAppellee, :\n-V.- : Docket Nos. 2l-58, 2l-\n: 77o\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant-Appellant, :\nee. }\nSTATE OF NEW YORK )\nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK : SS.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK_)\n\nLARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l746, hereby affirms under penalty of\nperjury:\n\nl.

On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool643\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 3\nMaxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this\ncriminal case.\n\na, Victim/Witness Identities\n\nMs. Maxwell’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and\nothers on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel\nfrom publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in\npublic fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine\nMaxwell.” Jd. § 6. This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 4 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to be\nentered in the above-captioned case, and to respond to the defendant’s leter and submission of\nJuly 27, 2o2o (the “Defendant Leter” or “Def. Ltr.”) (Dkt. 29). The Government and defense\ncounsel have conferred regarding a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order several times via telephone and email between\nJuly 9, 2o2o, and today, including as recently as this morning. The Government and defense\ncounsel have come to an agreement on much of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Houever, the\nparties disagree as to two inclusions sought by the defendant which the Government objects to and\nfor which, as detailed herein, the Government submits there is no legal basis. Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court enter its proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (the\n“Government Proposed Order”), which is atached hereto as Exhibit A, and which differs from the\ndefendant’s proposed order in those two respects, as further described belou.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Request to be Permited to Publicly Name and Identify Victims\n\nAs detailed herein, the Government seeks to protect the identities of victims, consistent\nwith their significant privacy interests and the well-established law in this Circuit, and proposes a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order consistent with those very significant interests. In contrast, the defendant insists\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order be modified such that she and her counsel would be permited to “publicly\nreferenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken on the public record to the media or in public\nfora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” !\n\n' Specifically, the defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order differs from the Government’s in that\n\nit adds a sentence, in its paragraph 6 (which is paragraph 5 of the Government Proposed Order),\n\nstating the follouing: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing\n\nindividuals who have spoken on the record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal\n\nor otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” The defendant also either adds\nDOJ-OGR-ooool664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 2 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 3\nspeak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because\nthose victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in\nconnection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false. The <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the Epstein case included\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool668\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 7 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s response leter and submission regarding the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the\nabove-captioned case, dated July 28, 2o2o (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.\n33).\n\nThe parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating to the\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. The parties agree that there are two areas of dispute as to which we\nrequire guidance from the Court. As noted in our opening leter and belou, we respectfully\nsubmit that the arguments made by the government are unavailing, and that the defense’s\nproposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, atached as Exhibit A to our initial submission (Dkt. 29), should be\nentered by the Court.\n\nl. Referencing Individuals Who Have Publicly Identified Themselves\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the scope of a proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is whether there\nare valid privacy interests at issue. It is the government’s burden to establish “good cause” that\ndisclosure will cause “a clearly defined and serious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d\nl94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7) (citation omited). The Court should also ensure that the proposed\nrestriction is “no broader than is necessary” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact\nthat the restriction may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full\ndefense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2). Throughout\nits leter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 2 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 2\nof course, has not had access to the discovery materials) to anticipate and respond to government\nhypotheticals regarding what the discovery might contain, and hou language might address such\nhypotheticals. But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 3\nboth the criminal case and in civil suits against him. United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v. Corley, No. l3-CR-48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (this\nCourt denied the defendant’s request for the disclosure of the full names of victims whose surnames had previously\nbeen concealed from the public record); United States v. Paris, No. CR. 3:o6-CR-64 (CFD), 2oo7 WL l484974, at\n*2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7) (permiting several victim witnesses to testify at trial without disclosing their full\nnames where they had not previously been publicly identified as sex workers); United States v. Kelly, No. o7-CR-\n374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL 5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (prohibiting public disclosure of identities of\ngovernment witnesses where there was no indication that the names previously appeared in the public record).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 29, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nreference the identities of the alleged victims in conversations with prospective witnesses (Gov’t\nResp. at 2), the defense will be limited in our ability to /ocate these witnesses without the\nbroader language proposed in our <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. It is therefore important to the defense\ninvestigation and Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order not restrict the\ndefense’s ability to publicly reference the names of Ms. Maxwell’s accusers who have already\nchosen to publicly identify themselves. °\n\nFinally, the government’s claim that the discovery will include the identities of\nindividuals “whom the Government does not expect to call as witnesses, and whose accounts—\nmuch less identities—will have no bearing on this case” is beside the point. (Gov’t Resp. at\n4). If the government were prepared to represent that it will base its case solely on the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment, the analysis might be different. But that is\nunlikely. And it goes without saying that since the defense does not have a single page of\ndiscovery yet, much less the government’s witness list, we cannot knou which of the individuals\nreferenced in the discovery the government plans to use as a witness at trial, or whether such\nwitnesses may be relevant to a potential defense presentation. Accordingly, the defense needs\nthe ability to conduct an appropriate investigation and the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should not curtail that\nability when there is no countervailing privacy interest to protect.\n\n2. Preventing the Improper Use of Discovery Materials by Potential Government\n\nWitnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order subjects potential government witnesses and\ntheir counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery\nmaterials—namely, if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial\npreparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing\nfor trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2;\nEx. A 493, 5).\n\nThe government construes the defense’s proposal as one that “impose[s] restrictions upon\nthe Government” itself. (Gov. Resp. at 5 (emphasis added)). It then provides a list of other\nstatutes and regulations that might impose restrictions on the government that may be in conflict\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, arguing that this possibility for conflict warrants rejection of the\ndefense’s proposed language.”\n\n* Tt is not, as the government gratuitously asserts, so that the defense can engage in witness intimidation. (Gov’t\nResp. at 3 n.2).\n“The government does not explain why, in the event of such conflict, it could not apply to the Court for resolution\nof potentially competing obligations.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 2 of 3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt. No. 33-l, 95. This proposal adequately balances the interests at\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 3 of 3\nstake. And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter motion\nseeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell’s ability\nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ Disclosure of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial production” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its production of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first production until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Such\ndisclosure is warranted when there is a specific shouing that the disclosure is material to the\npreparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See\nid. at 3o2; United States v. Rueb, No. oo CR. 9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\ndisclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 4 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court’s assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement\nat the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in this case, so\nthat she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed belou, Ms. Maxwell has been\ntreated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in\nher defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the\ncircumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2ol9, Mr.\nEpstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on sex\ntrafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)\ndue to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide atempt on July 23,\n2ol9, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation.

Thereafter, the government\nindicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s\ndeath.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than\nother similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a\ndefense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a\nmonth ago, on July 6, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.\nMaxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-\nday period (4o days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three\nweeks longer than the l4-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under\ncurrent COVID-l9 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to\nbe surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom\ndo not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms.\nMaxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense\ncounsel.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust lo, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter” or “Def. Ltr.”), requesting that the Court order the\nGovernment to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses ll months prior to trial, and\nrequesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the\nGovernment somehou delayed that initial production is nonsense.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was docketed on Friday, July 3l, 2o2o'—the timing of which was principally the\nresult of the defendant’s oun refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool), while the Court ordered\nthe Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial,\nfollouing the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those\ncircumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District\nof New York opinion from 2oo9 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court\n' The Defense Leter states that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was “entered” by the Court on July 3o, 2o2o.\nWhile that is the date the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on\nJuly 3l, 2o2o.\n> The Government’s most recent discovery transmital leter also included the months and years of\nbirth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether\nshe will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline\nfor any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 3 of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the\nIndictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the\ndefendant’s conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.*\n\nTo the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges\nagainst her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such\nmotion can be made in December with all other motions and follouing the completion of\ndiscovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of\nthis case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be\nmeaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery. See United States v.\nMahabub, l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Ltr. at l, 3,\nshould be of litle comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to\nscrupulously adhere to the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, that would not change the relevant legal\nstandards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Pagelof5\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Menon rien\nwww.cohen gressencom\nMark S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s leter, dated August l3, 2o2o, responding to Ms. Maxwell’s request that the\nCourt (i) direct the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims referenced\nin the indictment, subject to the restrictions of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case; and (il) order the\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery\nmaterials (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt. 4l).\n\nWith regard to the issue of alleged victims’ identities, the government concedes, as it\nmust, that this Court has the authority and discretion to order the relief sought, but claims that\nMs. Maxwell’s application should be denied as untimely and without merit. (Gov’t Resp. at 2-\n4). Instead, the government asserts that the appropriate and timely way for Ms. Maxwell to seek\nconfirmation of their identities is through a request for a bill of particulars, which should be filed\nin December 2o2o. (/d. at 3). The government then notes that it would oppose such a motion,\nwhich it claims should also be denied. (/d.). The government concludes that it will finally\nprovide confirmation of their identities in the 35oo material and a witness list to be provided\nshortly before trial. (/d. at 4).\n\nThe upshot of this is clear: in the government’s view, Ms. Maxwell should not knou the\nidentity of the three witnesses referenced in the indictment until at best just before trial, and\nshould have to spend the next eleven months (or longer) trying to conduct a defense\ninvestigation, in a case in which she is presumed innocent, without having this information.\nThis information is critical to conducting a meaningful defense investigation, given that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool724\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nin stark contrast to the 25-year-old conduct alleged in this case. Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at\n*|-2. The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool732\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page5of5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool747\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001748.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 2 of 5\nreference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case. For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), a Court may enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nonly after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was warranted.\nSee Dkt. No. 35 at l (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating\nto the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.”). The Defendant’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order included a\nprovision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt. No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 9 l(a), lo(a), l4(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery.\n\nUpon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which\nseeks modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in order to use documents produced in the criminal\n? Tn the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” In re Teligent,\nInc., 64o F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation omited). Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for\nmodification of <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in the civil context to the criminal context. See, e.g., United States v. Calderon,\nNo. 3:l5-CR-25 (JCH), 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case.

Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2.

In February 2ol9, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of\nthose civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury\nsubpoenas;\n\n4. In April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”) permited the modification and, subsequently,\nanother court (“Court-2”) did not;\n\n5.

Such a “sealed application” in furtherance of her Civil Litigation would\nbe “using” the materials for the civil case, exactly the conduct proscribed by the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order\nhere.

That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented.

The government further asserts that such disclosure will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allou delayed\ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(disclosure of certain discovery materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient shouing\nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

Nathan, Judge).\n\nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,\nADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the motion to consolidate is DENIED and the appeal is\nDISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.\n\nDefendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks interlocutory relief from a September 2, 2o2o\ndenial of her motion to modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered on July 3o, 2o2o. In the alternative, she\nargues that this Court should issue a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to modify the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. She also moves to consolidate the instant appeal with the appeal pending in Gzuffre\nv. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Meanwhile, the Government moves this Court to dismiss the appeal for\nlack of jurisdiction and opposes Maxwell’s motion to consolidate on the grounds that the issues\npresented on appeal are both factually and legally distinct. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the\nunderlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.”\nCobbledick v. United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc, 5ll U.S. 863, 867—\n68 (l994) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). The Supreme Court has described the\n“conditions for collateral order appeal as seringenf’ in general, Digital Equip. Corp., 5ll US. at 868\n(emphasis added), and, with respect to criminal cases, it has “interpreted the collateral order\nexception with the wimost strictness.” Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (l989)\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited). To fall within this limited category of\nappealable collateral orders, a decision must “(l) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2)\nresolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The\ncriminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order while the civil\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/o8/2o Page 2 of 3\nPage 2\n\n§ 37l.

Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F.

First,\ndisclosure would tend to reveal to the defendant the scope of and evidence gathered during the\nGovernment’s ongoing investigation, the details of which are not currently public or knoun to the\ndefendant. Second, an order requiring the immediate production of these Materials would risk\ndeterring other victims from coming forward to be interviewed and from providing evidence to the\nGovernment. Victims who may be considering cooperating with the Government’s investigation\nmay decline to do so if they believe that the information they provide—even information outside\nthe period charged in the Indictment—must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case.\nGiven the sensitivity of the Materials, the need to protect the Government’s ongoing investigation,\nand the minimal (if any) relevance of the Materials to the offenses charged in the Indictment, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that good cause exists pursuant to Rule l6(d) to delay their\ndisclosure.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\nGovernment’s request to delay disclosure of these Materials.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCe: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nThere is no dispute that the materials referenced in the Government’s\nleter will be turned over to the defense.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for\nRelease on Bail (the “Motion”) and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all\ncounsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the\nMotion. For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n49.l(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting\nmaterials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n* Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

They are\nlegitimately afraid that if their identities become public, they will be subjected to the\nsame relentless media scrutiny and threats that Ms. Maxwell has experienced for\nmore than a year, like the follouing sample of social media posts:\n“they need to get this bitch n string her up by her neck . . . f*cking monster .. .\n#GhislaineMaxwell.”\n“I hope someone finds her and kills her.

R. Crim. P. 49.l(d) provides that “a court may order that a filing be made under seal\nwithout redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing\nto file a redacted version for the public record.” While the Second Circuit has recognized a\npresumption of access under both common law and the First Amendment, it is appropriate to\npermit the filing of documents under seal if “countervailing factors” in the common law\nframework or “higher values” in the First Amendment framework so demand. Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256\nF. Supp. 3d 355, 4ll (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\nand finding that privacy interests “outweigh any public interest in disclosure, whether derived\nfrom the First Amendment or the common-law right of access”).\n\nMoreover, a louer presumption of public access applies to documents submited in\nconnection with pouers that are “ancillary to the court’s core role in adjudicating a case” than to\n“material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions.” Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 49-5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (applying louer presumption to documents submited in\nconnection with discovery and evidentiary motions than to summary judgment filings). Thus, a\nlouer presumption of public access ataches the parties’ pretrial bail submissions than to exhibits\nintroduced at trial or in connection with a motion to dismiss.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool852\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 25, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nHere, that louer presumption is far outweighed by the significant privacy interests\nimplicated by the materials at issue. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court’s\nbalancing equation”).

See id. at lo5l (“[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that\ntheir records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”). These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for\nRelease on Bail (the “Motion”) and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all\ncounsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the\nMotion. For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crm. P.\n49.l(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting\nmaterials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n¢ Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\n\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

They are\nlegitimately afraid that if their identities become public, they will be subjected to the\nsame relentless media scrutiny and threats that Ms. Maxwell has experienced for\nmore than a year, like the follouing sample of social media posts:\n“they need to get this bitch n string her up by her neck . . . f*cking monster .. .\n#GhislaineMaxwell.”\n“I hope someone finds her and kills her. That would be justice. Obviously her\nlawyers knou’s where she is, someone should stick them up to bateries untill we\nfind out where she is.”\n“SHE'S HERE in #Massachusets ?!

R. Crim. P. 49.l(d) provides that “a court may order that a filing be made under seal\nwithout redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing\nto file a redacted version for the public record.” While the Second Circuit has recognized a\npresumption of access under both common law and the First Amendment, it is appropriate to\npermit the filing of documents under seal if “countervailing factors” in the common law\nframework or “higher values” in the First Amendment framework so demand. Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256\nF. Supp. 3d 355, 4ll (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\nand finding that privacy interests “outweigh any public interest in disclosure, whether derived\nfrom the First Amendment or the common-law right of access”).\n\nMoreover, a louer presumption of public access applies to documents submited in\nconnection with pouers that are “ancillary to the court’s core role in adjudicating a case” than to\n“material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions.” Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 49-5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (applying louer presumption to documents submited in\nconnection with discovery and evidentiary motions than to summary judgment filings). Thus, a\nlouer presumption of public access ataches the parties’ pretrial bail submissions than to exhibits\nintroduced at trial or in connection with a motion to dismiss.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool863\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court’s\nbalancing equation”). If Ms. Maxwell’s sureties are publicly identified, they will be harassed\nsimply for their association with and support of her. Indeed, some of Ms. Maxwell’s closest\nfriends and - have _ suffered : _ — For - -\n\nThe sureties are legitimately scared that they and their children will suffer the same\nconsequences, and may not be able to come forward at all, if the Court does not allou their\nleters and their identities to be sealed. See id. at lo5l (“[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that\ntheir records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.|”). These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed. See id. (personal financial\nrecords traditionally considered private, not public).\n\nSimilar privacy interests led the court to permit the redaction of bail submission materials\nin United States v. Nejad (“Sadr”), Case l:l8-cr-oo224-AJN (S.D.N.Y.). Like this case, Sadr\ninvolved a defendant with meaningful assets and a bail package with numerous co-signers.

STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page l2 of 9l l2\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl and federal law disclosure obligations.\n\n2 Go ahead, Ms. Moe.\n\n3 MS.

Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 35 of 36\nother inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo2 Filed l2/23/2o Page l of l\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP Eran ane\nwww.cohengresser.com\nMark S.

Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. l5-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential\ndiscovery material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the\ngovernment and law enforcement. Faced with that <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, the government issued a\nOO —CSCSCSCSCi‘s\nSES l3) proceeding ex parte, the government\nensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations\nin support of its application.\n\nThe government then took full advantage.\nOO —SSC‘\nOO —CSCSCSCSC‘ieie‘\nOO —SSCSCSCSSCies\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘C‘i\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘(‘CCCS\nOO ——SCSCis\nOO —CtisSCSCSCies«S\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 23\n\nTo paraphrase Mary McCarthy’s philippic about Lillian Hellman, every word of the\ngovernment’s representation was untrue, “including ‘and’ and ‘the.’”! The government knew\nwhat was in the bad provided that information well before the\ninvestigation began. The government did indeed have previous contact with J. And\nBE was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution.\n\nThe record is surpassingly clear: But for the 3 I 7 77\nDs Ver would have permited the circumvention of the civil <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder, on which Maxwell relied in agreeing to sit for her depositions. This Court therefore has\nboth the authority and the duty to suppress the fruits of that misrepresentation, including the\nEe 2o the two perjury counts based on those transcripts. If the Court is\ndisinclined to exercise that inherent authority on the present record, Maxwell should be granted a\nhearing to examine the circumstances that resulted in the 7 7\nes.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in Giuffre v. Maxwell\n\nCounts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell commited\nperjury during two civil depositions taken in Giuffre v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case Virginia\nGiuffre filed in 2ol5. Giuffre claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell’s atorney-hired\npress agent denied as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Giuffre’s numerous allegations, over the span\nof four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause Giuffre to be “sexually abused\nand trafficked” by Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n' See Norman Mailer, “An Appeal to Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy,” 5/ll/8o New York\nTimes.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\n\nGiuffre, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill batle—even she\nwas constrained to acknouledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 46, 5l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (explaining that discovery was “hard-fought” and “extensive” and\nnoting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery,\ntotals in the “thousands of pages”).\n\nGiuffre sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about\nMaxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual maters. Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between\nthe parties, the district court entered a stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. See Ex. A. The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality\ndesignation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any\ninformation or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that\n“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the\npreparation and trial of this case and any related mater, including but not limited to,\ninvestigations by law enforcement.” Ex. B J l(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\nthis proposal, and it was never included in the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. Ex. A.” To the contrary, the\norder strictly limited the parties’ disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion\nof the case. In particular, paragraph l2 of the order provided that:\n\n[a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each\n\ndocument and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL\n\nshall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties\n\nmay elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to\n\ndestroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties\n\nwith an affidavit confirming destruction.\n\nEx. A § l2.\n\nB. Maxwell’s April and July 2ol6 depositions\n\nRelying on the confidentiality protections of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, Maxwell declined to\ninvoke her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and agreed to testify at her April\n2ol6 deposition. In that deposition, [las\nOO e—SSCSCSCSSCSCises\nOO —“SCSCSC‘C‘CCs\nOO —SSCSC:sCis\ni —SSCSCis\nOO —“CSSCSCsisCSCtsCies\n\nFollouing the deposition, Giuffre moved to compel Maxwell to answer additional\nintimate and personal questions that she had previously declined to answer. In support of the\nmotion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that “[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in\nthe discovery phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as\nconfidential under the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in this case.”\n\n* This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this\ninformation by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential\nmaterial to the media, other false claimants, and the government.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 23\n\nThe district court granted the motion. In requiring Maxwell to answer highly intrusive\nquestions “relating to [her] oun sexual activity” and “her knouledge of the sexual activity of\nothers,” the court held that Maxwell’s “privacy concerns are alleviated by the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in\nthis case.”\n\nSecure in the belief that the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order would be honored, Maxwell appeared at a\nsecond deposition, in July 2ol6, and answered hundreds of pages worth of questions about Jj\nes 2 es from the very first\nquestion, Maxwell discussed\nOO —CSCSCSC‘Cis\neee.

The Setlement And Boies Schiller’s Refusal To Comply With The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order\n\nIn 2ol7, the parties setled the defamation claim, and the case was dismissed. Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, 325 F. Supp. 3d 428, 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), vacated and remanded sub nom. Broun,\n929 F.3d 4l. As the district court found, “a significant, if not determinative, factor” in reaching a\nsetlement was its confidentiality. /d. at 446.\n\nAfter the case was setled and concluded, Maxwell repeatedly invoked Paragraph l2 of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order and demanded that Giuffre either return or destroy all confidential\ninformation, including her deposition transcripts. Boies Schiller refused.\nes es es ee ee\na\n\nD. The Government’s False Statements To i\n\nOnly in August 2o2o, after she was indicted in this case, did Maxwell finally learn that\nthe government had obtained the J file by grand jury subpoena.

HH.\nNeedless to say, neither Maxwell nor her atorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that\napplication or to contest the government’s representations in support of the application. This was\nall in direct violation of Paragraph l4 of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, which provides that the order may\nbe modified by the court only “for good cause shoun follouing notice to all parties and an\nopportunity to be heard.” Ex.

The role of <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in civil litigation.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> orders serve a “vital function” in civil litigation. Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel.\nCorp., 594 F.2d 29l, 295 (2d Cir. l979). They promote “the ‘secure the just, speedy, and\ninexpensive determination’ of civil disputes, by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence.” /d.\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. l). “If <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders were easily modified . . . parties would be less\nforthcoming in giving testimony and less willing to setle their disputes.” S.E.C. v.\nTheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o (2d Cir. 2ool). In particular, as here, “witnesses might be\nexpected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders if their testimony were to be\nmade available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those\norders.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295—96. Parties thus rely on <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders, and courts strictly\nenforce them. See, e.g., Stewart v. Hudson Hall LLC, 2o Civ. 885 (SLC), 2o2o WL 7239676, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2o2o) (“In the Second Circuit, there is a strict standard for modification of\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered by a district court.” (citation and quotation marks omited)).\n\nThis case illustrates just hou crucial a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is. The Maxwell depositions\nsought highly intrusive evidence of the most personal aspects of Maxwell’s life. Her sexual\npractices. Her sexual preferences. Her sexual partners.

A promise made by one atorney\nmust be atributed, for these purposes, to the Government.”). At the barest minimum, a federal\nprosecutor has a duty to check the entire file to ensure that his representations to a federal judge,\nsubmited on behalf of the office he serves and under oath, are true and complete.

This atempt, houever, involved inadmissible and\nimproper evidence, which was the subject of approximately 5o motions that remained undecided\nat the time that the defamation action was dismissed.\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nIt is in this context—a weak defamation claim—that Ms. Maxwell was deposed twice.\nBefore her first deposition, houever, the Court granted at Ms. Maxwell’s request a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder to shield any “confidential” information from what was sure to be a high-publicity, media\ncircus. Case No. l5-cv-7433, Doc. # 38.

Ms. Maxwell opposed this\nprovision, and ultimately, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order was entered without Giuffre’s proposed law\nenforcement exception. Ex. G.\n\n3. At present in a neighboring courtroom, Ms. Giuffre is embroiled in another defamation suit, this\ntime against Professor Alan Dershouitz. See Giuffre v. Dewrshouitz, Case No. l9-cv-3377-LAP. But\n\nProfessor Dershouitz has counterclaimed against her for defamation and related torts. /d. Doc. #9o &\n\nl27. In that mater, Professor Dershouitz recently filed an affidavit and transcript which document the\n\nreporter to whom Ms. Giuffre sold her story about Epstein and Maxwell revealing that she believes Ms.\n\nGiuffre and her lawyers fabricated evidence including her story about Professor Dershouitz. /d. at Doc. #\n2lo-l, 2lo-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo24l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 27\n\nDuring the first deposition on April 22, 2ol6, the subject of Count 5 of the Indictment,\nMs. Maxwell was peppered with ambiguous questions about decades-old events in unidentified\nlocations at unspecified times. The questions contained argumentative, loaded words and\nphrases that Giuffre’s lawyers refused to define or clarify and asked Ms. Maxwell to speculate\nabout Epstein’s intent and state of mind. The vast majority of the questions had nothing to do\nwith the actual truth or falsity of the claims of Giuffre that Ms. Maxwell pointed out as “obvious\nlies.” Counsel for Ms. Maxwell was required to object to hundreds of questions that suffered\nfrom a myriad of form and/or foundational infirmities. Ms. Maxwell, when siting for these\ndepositions, knew she had done nothing wrong and was unaware that Giuffre’s lawyers were\nencouraging the Government to initiate a criminal investigation.* And had, no motive to lie in\nresponse, particularly given that Epstein had long ago served a prison sentence in Florida arising\nout of the same conduct that was the subject of the defamation action.\n\nAlthough a few lines of that first deposition testimony are quoted in the Indictment, the\nGovernment improperly redacted objections to the questions and omited important preceding\nand follouing pages of testimony. The omited portions of the transcript include numerous\nobjections and requests for clarification regarding terms that the Government selectively quotes\nin the Indictment, such as “scheme,” “recruit,” and “sexual massage.” The two answers that the\nGovernment claims were knouingly and materially false statements were “I don’t knou what\n\n+ Stephen Rex Broun, “Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6: sources,” New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o)\n(htps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6ebfnszu-story.html) (detailing David Boies’ purported efforts to urge the SDNY US\nAtorney’s Office to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in February 2ol6, shortly before her first deposition, and\nagain after her second deposition, arguing in apparent violation of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that she had\ncommited perjury during her “confidential” depositions).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo24l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 27\n\nIn mid-2ol6 after this second deposition, according to media reports, Giuffre’s lawyers\nurged the Government to charge Ms. Maxwell with perjury based on her testimony.” It is\nunclear hou the atorneys could have done so without violating the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which\nforbade them from sharing the contents of these “confidential” depositions with law\nenforcement.\n\nII. The Indictment\n\nCount Five of the Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell made two false statements during\nthe first deposition in April 2ol6. Count 5 alleges that the follouing italicized testimony by Ms.\nMaxwell was both material and false:\n\nQ. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual\n\nmassages?

Count Six alleges that the follouing italicized testimony from\nthat deposition was both material and false:\n\nQ.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Int’!

Ms. Maxwell incorporates those facts by\nreference here.\n\nIn summary, the government obtained MY file, including the\nee, by way of a grand jury subpoena enforced through an ex parte\nproceeding befor lls\nRee. Although the government claimed not to knou what was in\na file and that A had no role in instigating the investigation of\nMaxwell, both of these representations to I were false.\n\nIn turn, the government issucd 3l i io thc\nRen. Sc Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and\nDismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex. C, at 3. The government could have been, but was not, more\ntargeted in its approach. The government has not provided Maxwell with a copy of the subpoena,\nbut the record shous that the subpoena was incredibly broad and, as explained belou, ultimately\nunlawful.\n\nThe subpoena violated the Fourth Amendment because it was overbroad and because it\neffected a warrantless search and seizure of material in which Maxwell had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. Moreover, by securing a modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order through a\nsecret, ex parte proceeding, the government violated Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel.

And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the\nguarantee of confidentiality provided by the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, the government trampled on\nMaxwell’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke\nin reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order.\n\nThis Court should (l) suppress all evidence the government obtained from [A\nand any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions\nand all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. The “Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena\nduces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,\n4lo U.S. l, ll-l2 (l973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 2ol U.S. 43, 76 (l9o6), abrogated in part on\nother grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (l964)).\n\nThe government engages in a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct\nencroaches on an individual’s legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an\nexception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 22\n\nMaxwell had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her EE because\nshe reasonably sought to preserve them as private.

For one thing, the Fourth\nAmendment was not at issue in Martindell, so the Court had no occasion to decide whether a warrant\nmight have been required. For another, Martindell does not speak to what shouing would have been\nrequired for the issuance of a subpoena, probable cause or something less. Even if a warrant weren’t\nrequired here, a shouing of probable cause was. See People v. Mason, 989 P.2d 757, 76o (Colo. l999)\n(noting jurisdictions that recognize an expectation of privacy in subpoenaed materials and that require a\nsubpoena duces tecum of such records to be supported by probable cause). Finally, of course, the\ngovernment didn’t comply with Martindell because it never gave Maxwell notice and an opportunity to\nquash the subpoena and to challenge the government’s misrepresentations through the adversary process.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo256o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 22\n\nNeither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a\nlegitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I.

Giuffre proposed a law enforcement exception to the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder’s confidentiality requirement, but Maxwell rejected the exception and the district court\nnever adopted it. Unlike in Smith and Miller, Maxwell did not “assume the risk” that her\nRe ould be divulged to the government.\n\nHad the government obtained the MY from Maxwell’s atorneys, there\nwould be no question that the government’s conduct would constitute a Fourth Amendment\nsearch. “[C]lients of an atorney maintain a legitimate expectation of privacy in their client files.”\nDeMassa v.

Because she did not voluntarily offer her I, and\nbecause she reasonably believed JJ was and would remain private under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, Maxwell had a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her\nEe oven though the government obtained them from a third party other than\nher atorneys. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-l5-o29, 828 F.3d at lo9o (“DAS’s current\npossession of [Kitzhaber’s] emails does not vitiate that claim. The Fourth Amendment protects\npeople, not places. Kitzhaber’s interests therefore atach to the things seized, not merely to the\nplace where they are located.” (cleaned up)).\n\nC. The government’s subpoena to J was an unconstitutional\n\nFourth Amendment seizure.\n\nAlthough Fourth Amendment challenges typically involve “the subsequent search of the\ncontainer rather than to its initial seizure by the authorities, . . . a seizure of personal property is\nper se unreasonable” under the “Fourth Amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to a\njudicial warrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized.”\nSmith, 462 U.S. at 7ol-o2.

The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988).

And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.)

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government's interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

She is weighed while\nclothed on scales that are erratic and not set to zero; on at least one occasion, the scale was set\nabove five pounds. Her eyesight is failing, and her hair is thinning. The guards are far from\nqualified to assess Ms. Maxwell’s physical condition.\n\nReleasing any inmate’s medical information (i.e., weight, vaccinations, etc.) without\ninmate consent is a HIPAA violation. By releasing such information regarding Ms. Maxwell, the\nMDC has violated HIPAA, a privacy breach compounded by the government’s leter. Requesting\nmedical atention puts Ms. Maxwell’s privacy and HIPAA rights at risk. We request that the\nCourt order the MDC to cease releasing Ms. Maxwell’s health information. Breach aside, such\ninformation falls within the “caution” category identified in Your Honor’s Individual Practice in\nCriminal Cases (see 8D (Redactions)).

The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). (Def. Mots. 3 & ll). In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination. Although the defendant styles her request for relief as two separate\n°5 The defendant asks the Court for leave to supplement her motion “after the government provides\nher with meaningful discovery” and notes that “after the disclosure of meaningful discovery, [she]\nmay request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not\nbeen dismissed on other grounds.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\ninvitation to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS),\n2olo WL 289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

As an initial mater,\nthe defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit\ncompliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would\nhave been covered by the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order only after receiving such authorization. In any\nevent, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis\nto suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the\ndefendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand\njury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she\nhad standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith\nexception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena\nviolated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires\ncoercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due\nProcess Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,\noutrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be\ndenied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government\nmisconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,\nshe cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 239\n\nEx. 7), but AUSA-l does not recall the details of that conversation (see Ex. 4 at 4), nor is the\nGovernment aware of any notes or other records documenting the substance of the call. The\nGovernment has not identified any records that suggest AUSA-l ever communicated via email\nwith Potinger, Edwards, Skinner, or any other atorney at Boies Schiller regarding this mater after\nMay 3, 2ol6.\n\nThe USAO-SDNY did not open an investigation into Epstein or Maxwell in 2ol6. (d. at\n4).\n\n3. The April and July 2ol6 Depositions of Maxwell\n\nOn March 2, 2ol6, Maxwell moved for entry of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for materials produced\nin discovery and submited a proposed order for the consideration of the Honorable Robert W.\nSweet, the United States District Judge who was then overseeing the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil\nlitigation. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. Nos. 38 & 39-l). On or about March 4, 2ol6, Boies\nSchiller represented that Giuffre did not oppose the entry of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, but opposed the\nform proposed by Maxwell out of concern that it was overly broad and could lead to over-\ndesignation of material as confidential. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 4o at 2). Boies Schiller\nsubmited a redline of Maxwell’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, deleting some provisions and adding\nlanguage that confidential material could be disclosed to law enforcement. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. B).\nOn March l8, 2ol6, Judge Sweet entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order governing the discovery and\ndissemination of confidential information after the parties agreed to the form of the order originally\nproposed by Maxwell. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 62; see also Def. Mot. 3, Ex.

Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.).\n\n4. The USAO-SDNY Commences the Instant Investigation in 2ol8\n\nOn or about November 29, 2ol8, the USAO-SDNY initiated its investigation into Epstein\nand possible co-conspirators, and formally opened the investigation by completing the requisite\npaperwork to open an investigation on or about November 3o, 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction. See Julie K. Broun, “Even\nfrom Jail, Sex Abuser Manipulated the System. His Victims Were Kept in the Dark,” Miami\nHerald (Nov. 28, 2ol8).*!_AUSA-l was not involved in the decision to open the investigation or\nin the investigation itself. (See Ex. 4 at 6). Indeed, AUSA-l stopped serving as the Office’s\nHuman Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator as of April 2ol7.\n\nShortly after initiating the investigation, the prosecutors involved in the investigation\nlearned of the prior February 2ol6 meeting and requested copies of AUSA-l’s notes and records\n3l Indeed, on July 8, 2ol9, at the press conference follouing the arrest of Epstein, Geoffrey S.\nBerman, then United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York, stated that while he\nwas not “going to go into any aspects of hou our investigation originated[,] I will say that we were\nassisted from some excellent investigative journalism.”\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003027.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 239\nfrom that meeting. On or about December 6, 2ol8, AUSA-l provided the prosecutors with her\nnotes from the February 2ol6 meeting (which are atached as Exhibit 5) and documents the\natorneys provided.*?\n\nSs The USAO-SDNY’s Subpoenas and Ex Parte Applications for\nMaterials\n\nShortly after opening the investigation in late November 2ol8, the Government identified\npossible victims and their counsel through public filings or media reports, which included Boies\nSchiller. (Def. Mem. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). The USAO-SDNY first contacted Boies Schiller about its\ninvestigation on or about December l8, 2ol8. Shortly thereafter, in or about December or January\n2ol8, the Government indicated to Boies Schiller that it intended to make document requests.\nBoies Schiller generally advised the Government that a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would govern some of the\nmaterials. (/d. at 3).\n\nIn or about February 2ol9, approximately two months after the USAO-SDNY opened its\ninvestigation (and almost three years after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting described above), the\nUSAO-SDNY issued two criminal grand jury subpoenas to Boies Schiller. One of the subpoenas\nrequested non-privileged documents relating to Giuffre v. Maxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (RWS); the other\n>? The Government has reviewed the file that AUSA-l provided to the prosecution team on or\nabout December 6, 2ol8 and understands, based on a review of that file, that at the February 2ol6\nmeeting, AUSA-l received copies of Epstein’s black book, flight records, and Palm Beach Police\nDepartment reports. Although AUSA-l does not nou recall the atorneys providing her with any\ndocuments at the meeting (Ex. 4 at 2), an email she sent to the prosecution team on December 6,\n2ol8 refers to these documents as materials that the atorneys provided at the meeting.\n\nThe Government notes that as of March 7, 2ol6, one week after AUSA-l’s February 29,\n2ol6 meeting with the atorneys when she received these documents, Maxwell had only produced\ntwo emails in response to Giuffre’s discovery requests. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at\nl-2). None of the documents apparently provided to AUSA-l during the February 2ol6 meeting\nwas an email. Accordingly, the Government has no reason to believe that Giuffre’s counsel\nprovided AUSA-l with any discovery materials from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case. AUSA-l\nalso does not believe she ever received any such discovery materials. (Ex. 4 at 6).\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003028.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 239\nrequested the same relating to Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN). Because\nof the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard\npractice under such circumstances, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel\nthat it had issued the subpoenas.\n\nIn response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not\ncovered by the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in the relevant civil cases. Houever, Boies Schiller also had\nadvised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest compliance with the\nsubpoenas, it believed that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full compliance.» (Exs. 8 & 9).\nAccordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet\nand Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with the subpoenas. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. C).\n\nFollouing a request by Judge Sweet for briefing supporting the Government’s initial\napplication, see Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 4, 2o; Ex. G at 6, the Government submited ex parte and\nsealed leters in support of its applications to each court on or about February 28, 2ol9. (Exs. 8 &\n9). The Government wrote, “Where, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the\nrecipient of the subpoena is not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply\nwith the subpoena—a court should grant such permission through limited modification of an\napplicable <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, absent countervailing interests not present in this case.” (/d. at 2). The\nGovernment submited that the court was “best guided” by Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins.\nCo., l54 F.R.D. 9l, 93 (S.D.N.Y. l994), in which the court rejected an application for a party in\ncivil litigation to be held in contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena by producing\n3 Significantly, and as detailed herein, Boies Schiller did not produce to the Government any\nmaterials subject to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders until, as further described belou, it received an order\ngranting it the ability to do so in one of the civil cases.\n\n67\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003029.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 95 of 239\nmaterials in violation of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, without first obtaining authorization from the court,\nbecause the court would have granted such authorization had it been sought. (/d.). The court also\nstated that such formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason was\nprovided. (/d.). In its leters, the Government noted that its “specific knouledge of the subject\nmater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential nature” of the litigation.\n(/d. at 2 n.l). The Government also submited that the court need not employ the Martindell\nbalancing test to evaluate the Government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order because (l) the Martindell balancing test generally relates to “instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without [ ] grand jury process” and (2) “any\npresumption against modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is unreasonable where, as here, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is on its face temporary or limited.” (/d. at 3-4).\n\n6. Proceedings before Chief Judge McMahon\na. March 26, 2ol9 Hearing\nJudge Sweet passed away in March 2ol9 before ruling on the Government’s application.\nAfter Judge Sweet’s death, but before the civil case was reassigned to a new judge, Chief Judge\nMcMahon took up the Government’s application. Chief Judge McMahon subsequently inquired\nabout the Government’s application in two transcribed ex parte and sealed hearings. (Def. Mot.\n3, Exs. D & E). At the first hearing, on March 26, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon inquired as to\nwhy Boies Schiller did not make an application for permission to be relieved from the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder, to which the Government replied that it could not “speak to why Boies Schiller in particular\ndidn’t make their oun application.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 3). The Government further noted that\nBoies Schiller “simply isn’t in a position to be able to describe the investigation in the way that\nwe have in our submission.” (/d. at ll-l2). Chief Judge McMahon noted that she believed that\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003030.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 96 of 239\nMartindell was applicable. (/d. at 3). She stated that were the Government’s application disclosed\nto the parties, “Maxwell would protest” and argue that the Government lacked standing as it was\nnot a party to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. (/d. at 8). In response to questions from Chief Judge McMahon,\nthe Government explained that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, on its face, did not implicate the types of\nconfidential business information or trade secrets ordinarily considered by courts in conducting\nthe Martindell balancing test. (/d. at l3).\n\nChief Judge McMahon stated that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order did not contain a provision allouing\na party to the order to disclose materials requested by law enforcement without permission of the\ncourt, noting her understanding that “it may have been negotiated out.” (/d. at l4-l5). The court\ninquired whether the Government’s position was that “reliance on the nondisclosure of\nconfidential materials to law enforcement in connection with a grand jury subpoena that has been\nduly authorized would be unreasonable.” (/d. at l4). The Government responded in the\naffirmative, stating that the Government believed a provision precluding compliance with a law\nenforcement request would be void for public policy. (Ud. at l5). The Government further cited\nChemical Bank in support of the proposition that it would be unreasonable to rely on a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder provision that barred the disclosure of information to law enforcement. (/d. at l5-l6).\n\nIn response to questions about the breadth of the subpoena, the Government explained that\nit was “essentially unable to significantly narrou the request for information ... . We have either\nlitle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are [and]\nwho was deposed.” (/d. at l7). In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003031.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 97 of 239\nof the materials in light of the “extraordinary protections” of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedue\n6(e). Ud. at l7-l8).\n\nFinally, Chief Judge McMahon also inquired whether the materials sought by the\nGovernment might be used to commence criminal proceedings against either of the parties to the\nlibel case, i.e., including Maxwell. (/d. at l8). The Government acknouledged that possibility as\na general mater. (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon noted that the parties to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order relied\non that order “in order to give whatever in discovery they gave, whether it was deposition\ntestimony they gave or — then again, I can’t fathom why anybody who has any criminal exposure\nwould not have taken the Fifth Amendment in response to questions in a civil deposition, but I\ndon’t knou.” (/d. at l8-l9). The Government stated, “I do not knou, but I think it is entirely\npossible that what we are seeking is page after page of people taking the Fifth. That is entirely\npossible. But to the extent that it is not or there are other materials -- and this may be bad for our\nargument, but in all transparency and candor, I think there may be other individuals who also relied\non the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” (/d.). The Government further explained that it “want[ed] to have a\nformal application” for the relevant materials and took that approach to “avoid the types of\nproblems” created by other less formal government requests in other cited cases. (/d. at 2o).\n\nb. April 9, 2ol9 Hearing\n\nChief Judge McMahon held another conference on April 9, 2ol9. She stated that she\nwanted “to make sure I’m not in a Chemical Bank kind of situation, so I would like to knou about\ncontacts between [the USAO-SDNY and Boies Schiller] prior to the issuance of the subpoena on\nthe subject of your investigation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added)).*4 In Chemical\n4 Tellingly, Maxwell omits the italicized portion of this question from her motion, thereby\nstripping important context from the nature of Chief Judge McMahon’s question which, as asked,\nwas focused on “your investigation.” (See Def.

Moreover, in that case, the\nDistrict Atorney seemingly opened its investigation and issued the subpoena in direct response to\ninformation provided by the subpoena recipient who was then a party to civil litigation. /d.\n\nThe Government responded to Chief Judge McMahon by explaining its contacts with Boies\nSchiller in connection with the instant (and only) investigation it had opened on Epstein, that is,\nthe investigation prompted by, and opened follouing, public reporting on Epstein in November\n2ol8. In particular, the Government explained that the USAO-SDNY opened an investigation\nfirst, on either November 3o, 2ol8 or December 3, 2ol8, and then made contact with Boies Schiller\nshortly thereafter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). In this respect, the Government further explained\nthat the USAO-SDNY, after opening the investigation, had endeavored to identify counsel who\nrepresented victims or witnesses in public filings or media reports, which included Boies Schiller,\nnoting that “[w]ith respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during the\ninvestigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil litigation” and\nindicated that the USAO-SDNY intended to make document requests. (/d.). The Government\nalso noted that, unlike in Chemical Bank, here Boies Schiller had informed the Government that it\nwould be unable to comply with the subpoena in light of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. (/d. (noting that\nBoies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there was a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that would\ngovern at least some of the materials, and that is why we ultimately made the application to the\nCourt.”)).\n\nCc.

(Def. Mot. 3, Exs. F & G). The Court noted that while the\nGovernment’s application was procedurally “[i]rregular,” there was precedent for granting the\nGovernment’s request and, therefore, the Court would consider the application. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.\nG at 6, 8-9). The Court found that, contrary to the Government’s arguments, it was appropriate\nfor the Court to analyze the Government’s application in light of the Martindell factors.

She evaluated\nthe factors under Second Circuit case law that are relevant to assessing whether a party’s reliance\non the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was reasonable, namely the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the language of\nthe order itself, the court’s level of inquiry before granting the order, and the nature of reliance on\nthe order. (/d. at l7). She concluded that first three factors favored granting the Government’s\napplication for modification. (/d. at l7-2o). Chief Judge McMahon noted that, as the order\n“plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure to anyone—law\nenforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic\npermission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s\nscrutiny.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\nAs to the last factor, Chief Judge McMahon found that “the nature of the parties’ reliance\non the order does seem to weigh against modification.” (/d. at 2o). She noted that the record\nindicated that “Giuffre likely could not have secured Maxwell’s deposition—at least in the absence\nof substantial court involvement—without” the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. (/d.). “Houever, the only thing\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 239\n\non which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is that Giuffre or her lawyers would\nnot do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, forward discovery materials in their\npossession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 239\nprovided to Boies Schiller shortly after it was issued. The materials provided by Boies Schiller\nincluded, in addition to deposition transcripts of Maxwell and other individuals, materials\nproduced by Giuffre, Maxwell, and non-parties, and court-related pleadings in the civil case.\n\nVs Magistrate Judge Netburn’s Order\n\nOn or about April 9, 2ol9, the Government advised Judge Netburn, who had not yet ruled\non the Government’s other application in Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al., l7 Civ. o6l6 (JGK) (SN),\nof Chief Judge McMahon’s decision via ex parte and sealed leter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. I).\nSubsequently, on April l6, 2ol9, Judge Netburn denied the Government’s application. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H). Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional\ncircumstances or a compelling need. (/d. at 3). She concluded that on the record before her, the\nparties’ reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality\nshould apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and\n“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn concluded that “the\nGovernment must demonstrate not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that\nthe reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to\nmodify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. The Government has not met that standard.” (/d. at 7) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n8. Unsealing of Maxwell’s Depositions\n\nThree months after Chief Judge McMahon issued her Order, Giuffre v. Maxwell was\nreassigned to the Honorable Loreta A. Preska on July 9, 2ol9. On or about July 23, 2o2o, Judge\nPreska ordered unsealed certain litigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell’s April\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 239\ncommited perjury.” According to two anonymous sources, “a second meeting occurred.”\nHouever, the Article cites another anonymous source as “insist[ing] [a second meeting] never\nhappened.”\n\nB. The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\nAmendment, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to permit compliance with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s application under Martindell, properly exercised her discretion\nin modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 239\n“Agent Orange” Prod.

The Second Circuit found that the “deponents [had] testified in reliance upon [a]\nRule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, absent which they may have refused to testify.” Jd. at 296. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit reasoned that the interest in the enforcement of Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norders—which included securing just and speedy determination of civil disputes—was sufficient\nto outweigh the Government’s interest in obtaining information by means of an informal document\nrequest. Id. at 295-96. The Second Circuit held that “absent a shouing of improvidence in the\ngrant of a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need, . .\n. a witness should be entitled to rely upon the enforceability of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order against any third\nparties, including the Government.” /d.; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated\nApr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d l22l, l224-25 (2d Cir. l99l) (“The Martindell test [ | does not transform\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order into a grant of immunity because the test allous a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to be\novercome by a shouing of improvidence in the grant of the order, extraordinary circumstances or\ncompelling need.”); Palmieri v. State of N.Y., 779 F.2d 86l, 862 (2d Cir. l985) (holding that\n“absent an express finding by the district court of improvidence in the magistrate’s initial grant of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders or of extraordinary circumstances or compelling need by the State for the\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S.\n665, 688 (l972) (“Although the pouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003040.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo6 of 239\nsupervision of a judge, the longstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s\nevidence,’ except for those persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory\nprivilege is particularly applicable to grand jury proceedings.” (internal citations omited)).\n\nb. Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’! Equity Invs., Inc. v. Opportunity Equity Partners Ltd., No. o5 Civ. 2745 (JGK)\n(RLE), 2olo WL 7793l4, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2olo) (finding that the parties’ reliance on a\ncivil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order “was not unreasonable given the nature of the litigation,” but “not so\noverwhelming as to warrant the indefinite application of Martindell’s strong presumption against\nmodification because the order’s broad scope and express language, and the minimal level of court\ninquiry outweigh the Parties’ reliance.”).\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo8 of 239\nway circumvented Martindell; rather, the Government sought court approval to enforce a subpoena\nand then folloued the directives it received.*”\n\nMost critically, houever, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell,\nMaxwell offers no legal authority for the proposition that suppression is the proper remedy.*®\nIndeed, none of the Second Circuit cases applying Martindell contemplate suppression as a\nremedy. See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional circumstances or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\ndiscretion in modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\napplication and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s invitation to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other\nindividuals’ depositions, who were not parties to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 239\ni. Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 239\nmarks omited) (emphasis added)); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l45 (“It\nis undisputed that a district court retains the pouer to modify or lift <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders that it has\nentered.”). It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def. Mot. ll\n\n85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 239\n\nat lo), the Court should reject the defendant’s efforts to twist Carpenter’s exception to the third\nparty rule beyond recognition. The defendant was not compelled to participate in the deposition\nor to answer questions without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; she\nvoluntarily chose to do so. Even if she chose to do so in reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, that\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was subject to modification under well-setled case law and by its oun terms.\nContrary to the defendant’s claims (Def. Mot. ll at lo), she assumed the risk that the deposition\ntranscripts would divulged to the Government. See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, No. l7 Cr. 4oo\n(AZ), 2ol9 WL 2677ll, at *5 (D. Or. Jan. l7, 2ol9) (declining to apply Carpenter where\ngovernment obtained defendant’s eBay transactions without a warrant as defendant “assumed the\nrisk that [eBay] would reveal to police the purchases he made” and defendant “did not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the records of his purchases”).\n\nBecause Maxwell had no legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the materials in\nBoies Schiller’s possession, she has no standing to challenge their seizure, and no warrant was\nrequired to obtain those materials. Her motion should be rejected on this ground alone.\n\nb. The Government Acted in Good Faith\n\nEven if the defendant had standing to bring this motion, it still fails because the\nGovernment only obtained these materials after obtaining a court order authorizing it to do so. The\nGovernment accordingly acted in good faith when it acted pursuant to that judicial order.\n\ni. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the so-called “good faith” exception, the exclusionary rule and its remedy of\nsuppression do not apply “when the Government ‘act[s] with an “objectively reasonable good-\nfaith belief that their conduct is lawful.’” United States v. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d l37, l43 (2d Cir.\n2ol8) (quoting Davis v.

Indeed, the good faith exception does\nnot apply only in four narrou circumstances:\n\n(l) where the issuing magistrate has been knouingly misled; (2)\nwhere the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial\nrole; (3) where the application is so lacking in indicia of probable\ncause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the\nwarrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nUnited States v. Moore, 968 F.2d 2l6, 222 (2d Cir. l992) (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 923). The good\nfaith exception analysis applies in the context of court orders. See, e.g., Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at\nl43 (applying good faith analysis in Fourth Amendment challenge to cell phone location\ninformation obtained by subpoena issued pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 27o3(c)(2)); United States v.\nSerrano, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol4 WL 2696569, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.

The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll7 of 239\n\nThe defendant repeatedly argues that the Government’s failure to mention AUSA-l’s prior\ncontact with Boies Schiller in 2ol6 was a misrepresentation that led to the modification of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\nincorrect. As an initial mater, the Government did not insist, contrary to Maxwell’s twisted\nreading of the transcript, that “there had been no contact whatsoever” between Boies Schiller and\nthe Government at any time prior to the Government opening its investigation. (Def. Mot. 3 at l).\nInstead, Chief Judge McMahon’s question was more specific: referencing Chemical Bank and the\ndesire to avoid “a Chemical Bank kind of situation,” Chief Judge McMahon asked about contacts\nbetween the two parties “prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation.”\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added); see also Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (omiting the italicized portion\nof the question)). In response, the Government described accurately its communications with\nBoies Schiller that had occurred in the time period surrounding the opening of its investigation and\nthe issuance of the subpoena. Additionally, and in light of the Government’s prior arguments to\nChief Judge McMahon relating to Chemical Bank,*® the Government atempted to address the\nmisconduct at issue in that case: namely the production of confidential documents without seeking\nmodification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order by confirming that, here, no such production had yet occurred.\n(Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2) (noting that Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there\n* See, e.g., Exs. 8 & 9 at 2-3 (discussing Chemical Bank as rejecting a contempt request where a\nparty “compl[ied] with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order” and\nfocusing arguments on the nature of the production of documents); (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l5) (the\nGovernment describing Chemical Bank as “essentially say[ing]: You should have asked, but of\ncourse this is fine for you to disclose this information to the government based on the validly issued\ngrand jury subpoena”); cf. (id. at 4 (Chief Judge McMahon describing Chemical Bank as saying\n“the proper procedure [for the production of documents] is for somebody to make a motion to be\nrelieved from the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order”), 2o (Chief Judge McMahon stating that “in the\nChemical Bank case, it all was ex post facto and it all happened’’)).\n\n9o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 239\nwas a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that would govern at least some of the materials, and that is why we\nultimately made the application to the Court.”)).\n\nWhile the Government appreciates, with the benefit of hindsight, that an answer that had\nalso referenced the February 2ol6 meeting (and the fact that USAO-SDNY took no action as a\nresult of that meeting) would have provided additional context—and would have further reinforced\nthat this was not a “Chemical Bank situation”—as noted above, the Government’s response\naccurately described its contacts with Boies Schiller as relevant to “your investigation” and the\nissuance of the subpoena at hand. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2).\n\nIn Chemical Bank, counsel for a civil party approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s\nOffice “suggesting that it had evidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” l54 F.R.D. at\n93. In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003053.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 239\n\nSecond, the Government did not misrepresent the extent of its knouledge of the contents\nof Boies Schiller’s files. As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government\nhad “either litle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there\nare [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at l7). In support of her argument, Maxwell\ncites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David\nBoies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2ol6, asking ‘if the\nSouthern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the\nGovernment has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-l does not\nrecall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-l\ndoes not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury\n(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2ol6 meeting refer to the existence of depositions\ngenerally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general\nunderstanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at\n2l). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knouledge of the\ncontents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon were incorrect.\n\nIn sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief\nJudge McMahon, and as such, the good faith exception applies. To the contrary, the record before\nthe Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s\nquestion and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in\nconnection with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knouledge of the contents of that file,\nand the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nUpon receiving a court order issued by a Chief United States District Judge who had carefully\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444). This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003056.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 239\n\nThe defendant asks the Court for a drastic remedy, namely suppression of a// evidence the\nGovernment obtained pursuant to the subpoena, as well as the dismissal of Counts Five and Six.\nIn so doing, the defendant seeks a windfall to which she is not entitled based on unprecedented\nclaims that ignore the facts and the law. Suppression of all materials the Government obtained\npursuant to the subpoena is unwarranted here, particularly where certain of the materials have been\nsubsequently unsealed by Judge Preska in the underlying civil litigation, including Maxwell’s\nApril 2ol6 deposition transcript. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. lo77). The Second Circuit\naffirmed Judge Preska’s ruling in October 2o2o, finding that the Court “correctly held that the\ndeposition materials are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access ataches,\nand did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests\nsuperseded the presumption of access.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. l4o-\nl at 3).” On October 22, 2o2o, the defendant’s April 2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5\nCiv. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l3). In February 2o2l, a redacted version of the defendant’s July\n2ol6 deposition was publicly filed. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l). In other words,\nhad the Government not obtained an order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the Government\ninevitably would have discovered and obtained, at a minimum, the defendant’s April 2ol6\ndeposition transcript and a portion of the July 2ol6 transcript that form the basis of the charges in\nCounts Five and Six.\n* Relatedly, the defendant moved to modify the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in order to use\nconfidential criminal discovery materials in filings she intended to submit in civil litigation. The\ndefendant raised this precise point—that if the Court ultimately decided that it was inappropriate\nfor the Government to proceed by subpoena, the Government would claim inevitable discovery.\n(Dkt. No. 54 at 3). The defendant offered no coherent explanation of hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no\ncase law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery argument by the\nGovernment should foreclose unsealing in a civil case. This Court rejected the defendant’s motion\nto modify the criminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. (Dkt. No. 5l). The Second Circuit also dismissed the\ndefendant’s appeal for want of jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 7l).\n\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 239\n\nContrary to the defendant’s argument (Def. Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\ntranscript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), l998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary\ncircumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\nconcluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\nAmendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 239\nb. Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not identified explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In Valentine, the\ndefendant was convicted of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o. The Second Circuit reversed\n\nlo7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 239\nGovernment has responded with reliable information directly rebuting the defendant’s allegations,\nthere is no material issue of fact sufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.**\n\nThe defendant cites Franks, to suggest that a hearing is somehou warranted, but her motion\nfalls far short of the standard required to obtain a hearing. “While the Franks analysis discussed\nabove is typically employed to evaluate misstatements and omissions relating to probable cause,\nthe Second Circuit has extended the Franks analysis to other Title III requirements for obtaining a\nwarrant.” United States v. Rajaratnam, No. o9 Cr. ll84 (RJH), 2olo WL 48674o2, at *l8\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2olo). The defendant fails to identify the standard that would govern such a\nhearing. In light of the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap, the USAO-SDNY submits that\nthe defendant’s depositions in a civil mater, even with a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, are no more significant\nthan the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap. As such, the exacting standard of Franks should\napply. On this record, the defendant has not made a threshold shouing that the Government acted\nwith the intent to mislead or in reckless disregard for the truth. The Franks standard is rightly a\n“high one,” Rivera, 928 F.2d at 6o4, and one the defendant has failed to meet here.\n\nThe defendant’s bald assertions alone do not entitle her to a fishing expedition in the form\nof a hearing.\n\nV. The Jury Should Decide Whether the Defendant Commited Perjury\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that, during the course of two depositions, the\ndefendant knouingly made false material declarations, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.

(See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law enforcement exception to the civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense.

For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.*”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?”7\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.”” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”).

The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”). The production of materials\npursuant to the Subpoena is solely for the purposes of the Investigation, and is subject to the\nprotections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n\nThe Government has been advised that Boies Schiller, which is counsel for plaintiffs in the\nLitigation, does not intend to contest the Subpoena. Houever, the Government is advised that\nalthough Boies Schiller would not otherwise contest compliance with the Subpoena, it believes\nthat a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered in the Litigation (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order”) may preclude compliance.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requested that the Court issue an order\npermiting Boies Schiller to comply with the validly-issued Subpoena.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL —\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case.

The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun.

But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is on its face temporary or limited. Such <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In sucha case, ““[w]hether to lift or modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’\"” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 5 (“This <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—trelied upon the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware.

Epstein, et al. (“Jane Doe”),\nl7 Civ. 6l6 (JGK) (SN) (the “Litigation”), a copy of which is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nBackground\n\nAs described in the Application, the Government has served a grand jury subpoena\n(the *Subpoena’’) upon Boies Schiller & Flexner (“Boies Schiller’) requiring the production of\ncopies of discovery and related materials related to the Litigation. The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”). The production of materials\npursuant to the Subpoena is solely for the purposes of the Investigation, and is subject to the\nprotections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n\nThe Government has been advised that Boies Schiller, which is counsel for plaintiffs in the\nLitigation, does not intend to contest the Subpoena. Houever, the Government is advised that\nalthough Boies Schiller would not otherwise contest compliance with the Subpoena, it believes\nthat a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered in the Litigation (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order”) may preclude compliance.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requested that the Court issue an order\npermiting Boies Schiller to comply with the validly-issued Subpoena.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL =\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case. As described belou, a court can and should\nmodify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, or permit limited relief from it, to allou the recipient of a grand jury\nsubpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.\nThe Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54\nF.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), which rejected an application for a party in civil litigation to be held\nin contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order,\nwithout first obtaining authorization from the court, because the court would have granted such\nauthorization had it been sought. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).\nId. at 94 (citing United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 42l-22 (2d Cir. l983) (finding that the\n“conflict between protection of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a\ncriminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent\napplicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no\nshiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury\nwhich subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94\n(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been\nnecessary of interests of law enforcement against protection of technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of\nthe discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omited).!\n' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described belou, the Government’s specific\nknouledge of the subject mater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential\nnature of the Litigation; houever, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order itself indicates that discovery materials\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial protection for the type of\ninformation the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality. It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is on its face temporary or limited. Such <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In such a case, “‘[w]hether to lift or modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’*” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 6 (“This <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—relied upon the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application.

Both motions are ripe for review. For the follouing reasons, the Court concludes that they\nshould be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThis is an action by two unnamed petitioners, Jane Doe | and Jane Doe 2, seeking to\nprosecute a claim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l. (DE l).\nGenerally, they allege that the respondent Government violated their rights under the CVRA by\nfailing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein,\nwho subjected them to various sexual crimes while they were minors.

First, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order by its terms affords Maxwell a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. Mot. 3, Ex. A, § 3 (defining “CONFIDENTIAL” information as that\nwhich “implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of . .. Ghislaine Maxwell”\n(emphasis added)). What would it say to civil litigants lf they could not rely on a court’s promise\nof confidentiality, at least absent notice and an opportunity to object to any breach of that\npromise (which, of course, Maxwell was denied here). See Mot. 3, Ex. A, § l4 (precluding\nmodification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order absent “good cause shoun follouing notice to all parties\nand an opportunity for them to be heard”).\n\nSecond, Martindell affords Maxwell a reasonable expectation of privacy. Martindell, 594\nF.2d at 294. In Martindell, the Second Circuit held that “the proper procedure” to obtain\nconfidential material under a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, “as the Government should knou, was either to\nsubpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a grand jury\ninvestigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to quash or modify the\nsubpoena, [Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)] or to seek permissive intervention in the private action\npursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)], for the purpose of obtaining vacation or modification of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” /d. (emphasis added)). By affording Maxwell a right to notice and an\nopportunity to be heard, Martindell makes clear that, having been denied those rights when the\nsubpoena was first issued, Maxwell has standing to challenge the government’s conduct nou.\nId.; see Lavender, 583 F.2d at 632.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 2o\n\nB. There is no good faith.\n\nThe rebutal to government’s good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith\nwhen the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search.\nAs the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon,\n\nSuppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing\n\na warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false\n\nor would have knoun was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.\n\n468 U.S. 897, 923 (l984).\n\nHere, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support\nthereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order\nand authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the\ngovernment acts in objective bad faith.\n\nC. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.\n\nThere are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.\n\nFirst, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (reversing\ndistrict court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no\napplicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence\nobtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to\nvindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States\nv. Cortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,\nin one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was commited within\nthe sanctity of the court itself.”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of 2o\nmodification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in an ex parte hearing (chock full of misrepresentations)\nwithout first providing Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard. Mot. No. ll, at ll-l5.\nThe government offers no response to this fundamental point—Martindell demands notice and\nan opportunity to be heard; Maxwell received neither. Resp. at 76-8l.\n\nNou, in an audacious request, the government argues this Court cannot evaluate the\npropriety of Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of Martindell, because Judge McMahon is a co-\nequal judge who exercised her sound discretion. Resp. at 8l & n.37. Were the government’s\nunsupported argument correct, though, it would mean that Maxwell will never have an\nopportunity to challenge the subpoena under Martindell, as that case and due process require.\nThe government is not right.\n\nThis Court does not oue deference to Judge McMahon’s decision, for at least three\nreasons. First, Maxwell never was given the chance to oppose the government’s request, so due\nprocess demands that she be given that chance nou. Second, Chief Judge McMahon did not\npossess all the relevant facts because the government improperly concealed them from her. To\nthe contrary, the government misled Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies Schiller and\nthe origins of its investigation, facts that were central to Judge McMahon’s decision to modify\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order and authorize the subpoena. Mot. No. 3 & Reply in Support Thereof. Third,\nthis Court is not tasked with deciding whether the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order should be modified or even\nquestioning the correctness of Judge McMahon’s modification. This Court is deciding a different\nquestion entirely—whether the government’s violation of Martindell requires suppression.\n\nAs to remedy, the government says that no case addresses whether suppression is proper\nfor a Martindell violation. Fair enough. Resp. at 8l.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel4 of 2o\n\nBut that’s doubtless because that law has been clear for forty-two years that the\ngovernment can modify a civil <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order and then subpoena confidential material on/y\nafter notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to respond. Martindell, 594 F.2d at\n294 (Martindell decided in l979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order at\nthe government’s request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST.\namend. V.\n\nThat no case has addressed the remedy for a Martindell violation is evidence only of (l)\nthe government’s prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or\n(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, houever, (l) the\ngovernment violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.\n\nSuppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is\ngrounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right\nto due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,\n594 F.2d at 294, as did the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, §] l4. But Maxwell had no idea that\nthe Giuffre <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the\ngovernment disclosed the 9o,ooo pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The\ngovernment’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (suppression for due process violation).\n\nSecond, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice\nand an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,\n\n* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet’s\npassing and is addressing the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be\nunsealed—apparently does not knou the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order was modified.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 2o\nMaxwell with perjury.* There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and\nBoies Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller’s conduct was in part at the government’s\nbehest.\n\nThe record in the Giuffre case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as\nwell. Based on Giuffre’s claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her\ndeposition, that Giuffre disclose any alleged “on-going criminal investigation by law\nenforcement” or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation.\nEx. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess “the\nimpact on any 5th Amendment privilege.” Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms.\nMaxwell the requested relief. Ex. B.\n\nThe day before Maxwell’s April 2ol6 deposition, houever, Judge Sweet ordered that\n“Tajny materials that [Giuffre] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over\n[by Giuffre] except for any statements made by [Giuffre] to law enforcement authority.” Ex. B, p\n2l. Maxwell had in fact served a discovery request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet\nGiuffre produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day.\n\nIn reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, which included no exception for any law enforcement\nneed or subpoena and based on Giuffre’s failure to disclose any “ongoing criminal\ninvestigation,” Maxwell did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\nduring that deposition and testified truthfully.\n\nAs explained in Maxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the\ngovernment has nou disclosed several documents “with respect to any criminal investigations”\n\n> Stephen Rex Broun, Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6, New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-story.html.\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo379o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 2o\nthat Giuffre possessed in February and March 2ol6. Under Judge Sweet’s pre-deposition order,\nGiuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2ol6 deposition.\nGiuffre’s failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet’s order, is compelling evidence\nthat Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when\ndeposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an\nevidentiary hearing is appropriate.\n\nThe government’s second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth Amendment right.\nResp. at loo. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knouingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745\nF.3d l5, 23 (2d Cir. 2ol4). And “‘knouing’ means with full awareness of the nature of the right\nbeing abandoned and the consequences of abandoning it.” /d.\n\nHere, Maxwell did not knouingly waive her Fifth Amendment right. She declined to\ninvoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, and on the\nunderstanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it\nturned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies\nSchiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material\nJudge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right\nand avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government fails in its atempt to distinguish United States v.\nOshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Resp. at lo2. The government says that the logic of\nOshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here,\nMaxwell was deposed “over two years before the Government opened its investigation.” Resp. at\nloo; id. at lo2 (noting that the defendant in Oshaiz “had already been indicted at the time of his\ndeposition in a civil case for almost seven months’’).

But based on the\ndiscovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Pretrial Motion No. 3, we knou the\ninvestigation actually began as early as 2ol6, when two months before Maxwell’s first\ndeposition, Boies Schiller met with the government and pressed an investigation for, among\nother things, perjury. This Court should adhere to Oshatz and, as the court there granted the\nmotion to quash, here it should grant the motion to suppress.\n\nThe government’s final argument is a red herring. Resp. at lo3. Maxwell’s argument is\nnot, and has never been, that a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order cannot be modified. Maxwell agrees that, under\nMartindell, and after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to be heard,\nmodification of a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order is appropriate if the government can shou “improvidence in\nthe grant of a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling\nneed.” 594 F.2d at 296. Here, Maxwell was never given notice and an opportunity to be heard,\nand Chief Judge McMahon’s finding of “extraordinary circumstances” was fatally tainted by the\ngovernment’s misrepresentations to her about the origins of its investigation.\n\nIV. The Court should hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\nBecause there are genuine disputes of material fact, and for the reasons given in\nMaxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, this Court should hold an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (l) suppress all\nevidence the Government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived\ntherefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions and all evidence derived\ntherefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.

To carry out this plan, the government sought ex parte subpoenas from two judicial\nofficers—Chief Judge McMahon and Magistrate Judge Netburn—for Boies Schiller Flexner’s\nfiles in the civil cases.\n\nMagistrate Judge Netburn rejected the scheme.\n\nJudge McMahon proceeded with caution, concerned about possible collusion between\nthe government and the civil atorneys. She haled an Assisted United States Atorney into\ncourt and asked him a simple and direct question: What contacts had there been between the\ngovernment and the plaintiffs’ lawyers? The honest answer to the question would have\ndisclosed at least one lengthy meeting and numerous follou up communications between the\ngovernment and the lawyers, a disclosure that would have led Judge McMahon to deny the ex\nparte subpoena request. But the government did not give an honest answer. The government\ninstead denied any contacts or communication between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and the\nplaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was no coordination\nbetween the government and counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,\nwhich resulted in the illegal circumvention of a valid <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Ms. Maxwell’s due\nprocess motion to suppress and the reply in support thereof set forth the relevant factual\nbackground. An evidentiary hearing on the motion will shed even further light, given the\nincredible nature of the government’s denials.\n\nIndeed, in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to exclude evidence obtained in\nviolation of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the government made minimal inquiries about the scope of\nits misrepresentations to Judge McMahon.

Further, this incident has put a chill on atorney-client communication\nbecause Ms. Maxwell no longer feels that she can bring legal materials to legal conferences.

Ms. Maxwell observed three guards going through the Redweld, reading\npapers and pages of the notebook, dividing papers into two stacks, and leaving the room with the\npapers. The lieutenant took the papers out of Ms. Maxwell’s sight. Ms. Maxwell asked the\nguards what documents were being taken; the guards refused to respond.

But unlike any other occasion, the guard team leader stood knee to knee with\nMs. Maxwell while Ms. Maxwell sat on the commode in the small area containing one toilet and\na sink. In addition to denying Ms. Maxwell any privacy, the guard confronted her in a confined\nspace off-camera.\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell was ultimately informed that she would not receive a disciplinary\ninfraction for the incident, being falsely accused of “‘a very serious offense” and having a guard\nstanding over her while she used the commode caused Ms. Maxwell to feel intimidated and\nhumiliated.\n\nA Further Chill on Atorney-Client Communication, Confidentiality,\nAnd Capacity to Prepare for Trial\n\nBeing falsely accused of an infraction, being threatened with discipline, and having her\nlegal papers confiscated has caused Ms. Maxwell to feel heightened insecurity under the control\nof her officious handlers. Further, this incident has put a chill on atorney-client communication\nbecause Ms. Maxwell no longer feels that she can bring legal materials to legal conferences. At\nthe in-person legal conference on Sunday, Ms. Maxwell specifically chose not to bring\ndocuments that if confiscated and reviewed by MDC staff would compromise her defense.\nDocuments seized on Saturday were given to Ms. Saffian, but it is unknoun whether any seized\ndocuments were retained or copied by the MDC.

The guards took undue\nadvantage of her. If they believed that counsel had given documents to Ms. Maxwell for her\nretention, they should have addressed the issue in the presence of counsel.

Doubling doun on an increasingly\nfarfetched story, houever, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it\nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.\n\nContrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor\nfrom the public corruption unit of the United States Atorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,\naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order entered by one of\nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.\n\nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would\nnever have obtained the 9o,ooo pages of material it nou possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention\ninjustice, to allou the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government\ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.\n\n“Tn a situation like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its supervisory pouer to make it\nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to oun up to it was\nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 _ Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of 34\n“ongoing criminal investigation” into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate\ndocuments, invoking the “law enforcement privilege.” Ex. P.’\n\nIn late November 2ol8 and early December 2ol8—just two months before AUSA\nME filed the ex parte request before Judge McMahon seeking modification of the civil\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order entered by Judge Sweet—AUSA [gg shared with AUSA gg, as\nwell as one other member of the trial team and the heads of the Public Corruption Unit,\neverything she learned from her contacts with Giuffre’s atorneys. Ex. N.\n\nAUSA J gave AUSA J and his colleagues: (l) nine pages of detailed,\nhand-writen notes from the February 29 meeting; (2) the emails she received from Giuffre’s\natorneys; and (3) all the documents provided to her by Giuffre’s atorneys. Jd. Some of what she\ngave AUSA included material Boies Schiller atorneys designated a short time later\nas “confidential” under Judge Sweet’s <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, including flight records and Palm Beach\nPolice Department Records.\n\nAUSA [ took an active role in gathering these materials from AUSA ggg.\nCopying AUSA yg. AUSA QR had emailed AUSA ggg on December 5, 2ol8,\nto obtain all the records of the February 29 meeting with Giuffre’s atorneys. /d. at l. In that\nemail, AUSA J also asked AUSA J whether, after February 29, she met “again\nwith [Peter Skinner] or anyone else.” Jd.\n\n’ Two other aspects to the privilege log are notable: (a) In the Giuffre litigation, Boies Schiller\ndid not produce its emails with the U.S. Atorney’s Office to Maxwell, despite the fact that they were\ndirectly responsive to a Request for Production of Documents Maxwell served just a couple of weeks\nafter those emails were sent; and (b) Peter Skinner, the Boies Schiller atorney at the AUSA yyy\nmeeting who also sent emails to AUSA gg after the meeting, Ex. L, is not even listed on the\nprivilege log, though the log purports to reflect a// email communications about the “ongoing criminal\ninvestigation” that Boies Schiller had tried to initiate just a couple of weeks earlier.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l9 of 34\n\nFor one thing, the government admits that Giuffre’s atorneys turned over several\ndocuments in 2ol6, which were in the government’s possession when AUSA gg claimed\nto Judge McMahon that he did not knou what was in Boies Schiller’s file. Moreover, by the time\nAUSA [RE told Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would\nshou “page after page of people taking the Fifth,” it was already a mater of public record that\nMaxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex. Q, p l.\n\nThe government’s argument also defies logic. The government was asking Judge\nMcMahon to authorize a subpoena of Boies Schiller’s entire file. At a minimum, the government\nhad to have asked Boies Schiller about the size of the file and issues related to privilege to\ndetermine if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or notify either the civil court or\nMaxwell when the subpoena was issued and responsive documents produced. In fact, the\ngovernment issued two subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the first for material covered by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, and the second for material outside the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order’s reach. Clearly, the\ngovernment knew more about Boies Schiller’s file than AUSA J Ict on.\n\ne Defense 6: The “subject of your investigation” to whom Judge McMahon\n\nreferred was Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAccording to the government, when Judge McMahon asked AUSA J “about\ncontacts between the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the\nissuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation,” Mot. Ex. E, p 2, Judge McMahon\nwas referring only to Epstein. Resp. at 7l. This is not a plausible reading of the transcript.\n\nAfter his first appearance before her, Judge McMahon haled AUSA J back to\ncourt for one reason. “I'll be very up-front with you,” she said. Mot.

But I am not faced with that situation.\n\nNothing in this record suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to\n\ndo with the Government’s decision to convene a grand jury to look into the maters\n\nthat were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the Government has\n\nadvised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties\n\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the\n\nGovernment that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its\n\nfiles because of the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. There is no evidence of\n\n“collusion,” to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller\n\ndid not foment the Government’s investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United\n\nStates Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies\n\nSchiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood on\n\nhis/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.\nId. at 2l.\n\nContrary to Judge McMahon’s understanding, Boies Schiller contacted the government\n(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of “collusion”; it was “quite clear that\nBoies Schiller did . . . foment the Government’s investigation”; and AUSA yg knew\nmuch more about what was in Boies Schiller’s files than he let on.\n\nThe Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant\natempts to foment a criminal investigation of her opponent—is exactly what occurred.\n\nJudge McMahon cannot be faulted for not knouing all the facts. AUSA yg, on\nthe other hand, had a “complete handle on the landscape,” and he withheld the truth from Judge\nMcMahon. Had AUSA J not misled her, it is clear Judge McMahon would not have\nauthorized the subpoena.”!\n\n*l It’s notable that even without the benefit of truth from AUSA J.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 267 of 349\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.3”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o8 of 349\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 (Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 296 Filed o5/28/2l Pagelofl\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP M3l2 987 76oo phone\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nMaxwell moves to suppress evidence obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law\nfirm involved in earlier civil litigation against her. She contends that because the documents\nsought by the subpoena were previously subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the Government obtained\nthem in violation of her rights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, and to due process of law. For the reasons that follou, the Court\nconcludes that the evidence should not be suppressed and that Maxwell is not entitled to an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn late 2ol5, Virginia Giuffre sued Maxwell for defamation. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, No.\nl5-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.). Giuffre alleged that Maxwell defamed her by accusing her of lying\nabout Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein sexually abusing her. The law firm Boies Schiller Flexner\nLLP (BSF) represented Giuffre in the dispute. The parties litigated the case for about two years\nbefore signing a confidential setlement agreement.\n\nEarly in the civil litigation, one of the atorneys representing Giuffre approached an\nAssistant United States Atorney (AUSA) in the Southern District of New York and requested a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004786.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page2of2l\nmeeting to provide the Government information on possible criminal conduct. The AUSA met\nwith three atorneys who represented Giuffre on February 29, 2ol6. The AUSA’s notes from the\nmeeting reflect that it focused primarily on Epstein. Houever, the notes also identify Maxwell\nas Epstein’s “head recruiter” of underage girls. The atorneys sent a few follou-up emails to the\nAUSA in the follouing weeks. The United States Atorney’s Office did not pursue a criminal\ninvestigation at that time.\n\nMaxwell claims based on a New York Daily News article published in October 2o2o that\na second meeting took place between federal prosecutors and a principal of BSF in the summer\nof 2ol6. The Government has represented to the Court that the AUSA who participated in the\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 meeting did not participate in a second meeting with BSF atorneys and that\nthe Government has “uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred.” Dkt. No. 2o4,\nat 92. Houever, for purposes of deciding this motion, the Court assumes that it occurred.\n\nAbout two weeks after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, the judge presiding over the civil\ncase entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that alloued the parties in that case to designate documents\nproduced in discovery as confidential. See Dkt. No. l34-l. That order prohibited the parties\nfrom disclosing confidential documents to anyone other than people involved in the case.\nAlthough BSF initially proposed language that would allou disclosure of documents to law\nenforcement without a court order, the final version of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order included no such\nexception. The <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order did not require the parties to obtain the court’s approval to mark\na document as confidential. It alloued the court to modify the order at any time for good cause\nafter notice to the parties. It also alloued the parties to use any confidential information at trial,\nat which point that information would become public. It required the parties to return or destroy\nconfidential records after the case ended.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4786\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page3of2l\n\nFollouing entry of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, Maxwell testified in two depositions in the civil\ncase. The parties designated the depositions as confidential under the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Counts\nfive and six of the Sl superseding indictment in this case (and counts seven and eight of the S2\nsuperseding indictment) charge that Maxwell made false statements under oath in each of the\ndepositions.\n\nThe Government represents that the Office of the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York formally opened its investigation into Epstein on November 3o, 2ol8, follouing a\nseries of articles in the Miami Herald about Epstein’s conduct and the lenient plea deal he\nreceived in the Southern District of Florida. The same day, the AUSA who atended the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting forwarded the emails she received from atorneys in the civil case to the\nprosecutors working on the fledgling investigation. There is no indication that she was involved\nin the decision to begin the investigation into Epstein in 2ol8.\n\nAbout two months later, the Government served a grand jury subpoena on BSF seeking\nto obtain documents for its investigation of Epstein. BSF informed the Government that many of\nthe requested documents fell under the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. The Government then applied for an ex\nparte order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to allou BSF to comply with the subpoena. The\nGovernment made a second, similar application in connection with a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in a\ndifferent case.\n\nThe judge who presided over the civil case passed away in March 2ol9, and so then-\nChief Judge McMahon heard the Government’s ex parte application. In a hearing on March 26,\n2ol9, Judge McMahon explained that she believed the Second Circuit’s decision in Martindell v.\nInternational Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), governed the\nGovernment’s application. Martindell held that a party should not provide documents subject to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page4of2l\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to the Government absent a formal motion or subpoena. It further held that a\ncourt should modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that a party reasonably relied on only if the order had\nbeen improvidently granted or upon a shouing of extraordinary circumstances or compelling\nneed.\n\nJudge McMahon held a second ex parte hearing on April 9, 2ol9. At that hearing, citing\na district court case called Chemical Bank for the proposition that civil litigants ought not foment\ncriminal investigations against their opponents to gain strategic advantage, she asked the\nGovernment about contacts between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF on the subject of the\nGovernment’s investigation. The Government explained that BSF had informed the Government\nthat some of the documents the Government sought were covered by a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. The\nGovernment did not mention any of the communications with BSF atorneys in 2ol6.\n\nJudge McMahon issued a sealed order granting the Government’s application folloued\nby a sealed opinion dated April 9, 2ol9. In the opinion, she explained that Martindell governed\nthe Government’s application, but that two of the Martindell factors supported modification of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. First, Maxwell did not reasonably rely on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order because it\nwas subject to modification. Second, the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances\nsupporting modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order because it could not otherwise obtain information\nabout the high-profile targets of its investigation without tipping them off. Magistrate Judge\nNetburn denied the Government’s similar application in another case, applying the same\nstandard but concluding that the Government had not shoun extraordinary circumstances or\ncompelling need.\n\nFollouing Judge McMahon’s order, BSF turned over its records from the civil litigation\nto the Government. Those documents included transcripts of Maxwell’s depositions.

Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 53 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Much of what the Government obtained through its subpoena,\nincluding the bulk of the deposition transcripts Maxwell nou seeks to suppress, have since been\nunsealed by court order in the civil case. See Giuffre, No. l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. ll37, l2l2.\n\nI. Discussion\n\nMaxwell objects both to the Government obtaining documents covered by the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder and to the Government’s conduct in doing so. She contends that she agreed to testify in the\ncivil case only because of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, and thus that the Government’s use of her\ndeposition testimony against her would violate her right against compelled self-incrimination.\nShe contends that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents covered by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, and thus that the Government should not have been able to obtain them without\na warrant. And she contends that the Government circumvented the requirements of Martindell\nand violated her due process rights by misleading Judge McMahon about the Government’s prior\ncommunications with BSF.\n\nThe Court finds that none of these arguments support suppression of evidence or justify\nan evidentiary hearing. The Court begins with Maxwell’s claim that the Government violated\nher right against compelled self-incrimination by obtaining her deposition testimony from the\ncivil case. It next turns to her claim that the Government violated her right against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Finally, it addresses Maxwell’s claim that the Government misled Judge\nMcMahon in seeking modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the earlier civil case.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page6of2l\n\nA. The Government did not violate Maxwell’s right against self-incrimination\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The [Supreme] Court has held\nrepeatedly that the Fifth Amendment is limited to prohibiting the use of ‘physical or moral\ncompulsion’ exerted on the person asserting the privilege.” Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S.\n39l, 397 (l976) (quoting Perlman v. United States, 247 U.S. 7, l5 (l9l8)). It does not prohibit\nthe Government from using a defendant’s voluntary statements in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.\n\nTo establish a violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination, Maxwell must\n“demonstrate the existence of three elements: l) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication,\nand 3) the incriminating nature of that communication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d\nll66, ll68 (2d Cir. l987). Maxwell contends that the Government violated her right against\ncompelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies of her deposition transcripts from her earlier\ncivil case. She acknouledges that she could have, but did not, invoke her Fifth Amendment\nrights to avoid providing incriminating testimony. See, e.g., Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a subsequent criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no guarantee that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v. Stat. Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir.\nl989). As the Second Circuit has explained, a civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order may (as here) be overturned\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page/7of2l\nor modified by another court in another proceeding. /d. A civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; Giuffre v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a reasonable basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order against the use of their testimony in a\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page 8of2l\ninculpatory. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 4lo-ll. This is no such case. The existence of deposition\ntranscripts in Maxwell’s civil case is not inculpatory. It is the content of those transcripts that is\nat issue.\n\nIn the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relies primarily on a single\ndistrict court case decided the year before the Second Circuit’s decision in Andover that quashed\na subpoena for deposition testimony covered by a civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. See Dkt. No. l4o, at\nl6-l7 (citing United States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988)); Dkt. No. 2l2, at l2-\nl3 (same). Oshatz does not suggest that the use of civil deposition testimony in a subsequent\ncriminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against compelled self-incrimination—and if it\ndid, that view would be plainly inconsistent with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential\nopinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a court should modify a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to allou a government subpoena. Maxwell cites no case in which a court has\nsuppressed evidence because another court erred in modifying a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Even if\nMaxwell were right that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should not have been modified, it would not\ntransform her earlier deposition testimony into the product of coercion.\n\nThe Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against\nher in her perjury trial notwithstanding any violation of her right against compelled self-\nincrimination. The Supreme Court has held that a defendant may be prosecuted for false\nstatements in unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l79\n(l977); United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (l969). As in Knox, Maxwell seeks to suppress\nher deposition transcripts not because they are inculpatory “for a prior or subsequent criminal\nact” but because her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal. Knox,\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pageloof2l\nSupreme Court has held that people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in geographical\ninformation obtained from their cell phones, because that information provides a comprehensive\naccount of a person’s movements akin to invasive physical surveillance. See Carpenter, l38 S.\nCt. at 22l9-2o.\n\nUnder this standard, Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Those documents may not have been public, but they were\nhardly private. The <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order alloued them to be shared freely with each of the follouing\ncategories of people:\n\ne The parties to the case.\n\ne Atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne People employed by or associated with atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne Expert witnesses.\n\ne Fact witnesses.\n\ne Potential witnesses.\n\ne Court personnel and stenographers.\nIt also alloued any documents to be publicly used at trial. This is not a case like Carpenter\nwhere new technology has alloued police to access heretofore “unknouable” information about\na person’s private life. /d. at 22l8. This is a case where Maxwell shared information with third\nparties through the routine process of civil litigation and nou objects that they shared it with the\nGovernment, too.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent makes clear that Maxwell had no reasonable expectation that\ndocuments covered by the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would remain shielded from view of the public or\nprosecutors. The Second Circuit has cautioned civil litigants that a civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is no\nguarantee against the use of evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. See Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Second Circuit precedent allous a court in a subsequent proceeding to modify a\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004795.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagellof2l\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. /d. And if confidential materials turn out to be relevant to a court’s ruling,\nSecond Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that they will be made public\nnotwithstanding any <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. These are not remote or\ntheoretical possibilities. Each of them predictably came to pass in this case. See Broun, 929\nF.3d at 48 & n.22; Giuffre, 827 F. App’x at l45. It is “unrealistic” to believe that deposition\ntestimony central to a civil case of high public interest will remain effectively sealed indefinitely.\nAndover, 876 F.2d at lo83.\n\nMaxwell claims that she did not expect the Government to be able to obtain her\ndeposition testimony, and that if she knew it would, she never would have testified. If Maxwell\nsubjectively harbored this belief, it was nonetheless unreasonable. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743.\nThe Court further notes that Maxwell was ably represented by a number of atorneys during the\ncivil litigation, who the Court is confident were familiar with the precedents governing <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norders and public access to judicial documents.\n\nBecause Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents shared with\nthird parties during the civil case, the Government did not engage in a search when it obtained\nthose documents from a third party by subpoena. Maxwell also makes a half-hearted argument\nthat obtaining those documents was a seizure of her personal property. Copies of documents\nheld by a law firm that represented Maxwell’s adversary in a civil case were not Maxwell’s\npersonal property. Thus, the Government engaged in neither a search nor a seizure, and so it did\nnot violate Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nThe Government also contends that even if it improperly obtained documents pursuant to\nthe grand jury subpoena, the Court should not suppress those documents because the\nGovernment acted in good faith and would have obtained the documents anyway. See Nix v.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel5of2l\n\nAlthough Maxwell relied on Franks in her opening brief, she argues in reply that she\nneed not satisfy that standard. See Dkt. No. l34, at l6; Dkt. No. 285, at 23. Houever, she\nprovides no explanation for why Franks should not apply. To the extent she offers any\nalternative framework in her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever any\nfactual issue related to a motion to suppress is in dispute. That formulation is far too broad.\n\nThe Court agrees with the Government (and the suggestion in Maxwell’s opening brief)\nthat Franks provides the appropriate standard for whether Maxwell is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on her motion. To be sure, these cases are not identical. Franks dealt with an alleged\nfalse statement in a warrant affidavit. This case involves an alleged false statement in a hearing\nto modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to allou a grand jury subpoena. Franks involved a claim under the\nFourth Amendment, while Maxwell couches hers in the Fifth. But while not identical, these\nsetings are closely analogous. Each involves alleged misstatements to a court that alloued the\nGovernment to obtain evidence. Each presents a risk of a defense fishing expedition where no\nwrongdoing appears on the face of the Government’s application. Each requires balancing\nsimilar interests—deterrence of deliberate misconduct on the one hand, and suppression of\nevidence inevitably discovered or obtained through innocent error on the other. The Second\nCircuit has already extended Franks past its precise factual context to a motion to suppress based\non alleged misrepresentations in a wiretap application. See United States v. Rajaratnam, 7l9\nF.3d l39, l5l (2d Cir. 2ol3). The Court concludes that Maxwell must at least meet this standard\nfor a similar claim invoking the Court’s inherent authority.\n\nMaxwell must thus make a substantial preliminary shouing on each of Franks’\nrequirements to justify an evidentiary hearing. United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, ll3 (2d\nCir. l998). That is, she must first make a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4799\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel6of2l\ndeliberately or recklessly misrepresented facts to Judge McMahon. Second, she must make a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing that Judge McMahon would have denied the Government’s\napplication absent any such misrepresentation. The Court finds that Maxwell has not made a\nsubstantial preliminary shouing on either prong.\n\nMaxwell’s argument here centers on the Government’s statements to Judge McMahon\nduring the second proceeding on April 9, 2ol9, concerning its application to modify the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. At that proceeding, Judge McMahon explained that she wanted to make sure\nthe Government’s request did not present a similar situation to that in Chemical Bank v.\nAffiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), where a party in civil litigation urged\nprosecutors to instigate a criminal investigation and then provided confidential documents in\nviolation of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. To that end, she asked the Government to explain “contacts\nbetween the United States Atorney’s Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of\nthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation.” The prosecutor at that hearing informed\nJudge McMahon about all communications between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and BSF after\nthe current investigation began—namely, that the Government told the firm that it intended to\nmake a document request and that the firm told the Government that some of the materials were\nsubject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Although the prosecutor was included on an email several months\nearlier from the AUSA who met with Giuffre’s atorneys in 2ol6, he did not inform Judge\nMcMahon about any communications with BSF before the current investigation began.\n\nMaxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing that the Government’s\nstatement was a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation. The AUSA could reasonably have\nunderstood Judge McMahon’s question to concern only communications about the\nGovernment’s current investigation. Maxwell contends that the question asked for any\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel7 of 2l\ncommunications between BSF and the Government related to Epstein or Maxwell. But an\nequally plausible understanding of the phrase “‘on the subject of your investigation” is “related to\nthe investigation itself.” That interpretation is all the more reasonable in context, because\nChemical Bank involved communications between a party subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and\nprosecutors during a pending criminal investigation. See Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. It\nwas not unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that Judge McMahon was concerned with\nthose sorts of communications, not communications years earlier that did not lead to a criminal\ninvestigation. The Government has represented that its present investigation into Epstein (and\nlater Maxwell) began only follouing publication of the Miami Herald expose in 2ol8. Maxwell\nhas made no substantial preliminary shouing to the contrary.\n\nThe Court also concludes that Maxwell has made no substantial preliminary shouing that\nJudge McMahon would have denied the Government’s application to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nif she knew about the 2ol6 communications. Materiality under Franks requires more than that a\nfact be important. It allous suppression only if “the allegedly false statement is necessary” to\nthe court’s finding. Franks, 438 U.S. at l56 (emphasis added). If Judge McMahon would still\nhave ruled that the Government was entitled to ex parte modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order even\nafter seting aside the Government’s alleged misrepresentation, then Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression. Judge McMahon’s opinion reflects that she would have.\n\nJudge McMahon’s ruling rested on two independent grounds. Analyzing the\nGovernment’s application under Martindell, she first held that Maxwell could not have\nreasonably relied on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to keep the Government from obtaining documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Judge McMahon reasoned that a civil litigant ordinarily may\nnot rely on a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order subject to modification to keep evidence out of the hands of\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors.

Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. She observed that\nmodification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court thus finds that Maxwell has not made a substantial preliminary shouing under\neither prong of Franks, and thus that she is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. For the same\nreasons, and because the present record does not establish a violation of due process, the Court\ndeclines to suppress the evidence obtained by the Government’s grand jury subpoena.\n\nD. Martindell provides no independent basis for suppression\n\nThe Court turns finally to Maxwell’s argument that Martindell provides an independent\nbasis for suppression. Maxwell cites no authority in her opening brief for the proposition that a\ncourt may suppress evidence because it disagrees with another court’s decision to modify a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order under Martindell. Indeed, there is no such authority. No court has ever granted\na motion to suppress on this ground. The Court declines to review Judge McMahon’s decision,\nbecause Martindell provides no basis to suppress evidence even if this Court were to disagree\nwith it.\n\nEven if Maxwell were right that this Court should review Judge McMahon’s decision on\nthe merits, that decision—like a magistrate’s probable cause determination—would be entitled to\n“sreat deference.” Leon, 468 U.S. at 9l4. Courts will uphold another judge’s decision to allou\nthe Government to obtain evidence on a motion to suppress so long as there is a “substantial\nbasis” for the decision. Salameh, l52 F.3d at ll3 (quoting //linois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 2l3, 238-\n39 (l983)). Judge McMahon found that the Government had established exceptional\ncircumstances to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order based on the factual record before her. Judge\nMcMahon concluded that modification was necessary under the circumstances to allou the\nGovernment to investigate a high-profile mater in secrecy and so not to tip off the target of the\ninvestigation. Although reasonable minds may differ—indeed, Judge Netburn reached the\nopposite conclusion—there was a substantial basis for Judge McMahon’s decision and it is thus\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Page 2o of 2l\nentitled to deference. As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is necessary or appropriate in these circumstances. If\nnecessary, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\napplication for modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in her earlier civil\ncase. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o8 Filed o7/ol/2l Pagelofl\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK I I yeti\nDATE FILED:_7/l/2o2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

(“the Giuffre Action”), in order to permit the law firm of !\nBoies Schiller Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to comply with a grand jury subpoena. |\nThe application is granted. |\nl. Background | |\nA. The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order\nIn September 2ol5, Virginia L. Giuffre commenced a civil suit against Ghislaine\nMaxwell, alleging that Maxwell had defamed Giuffre by stating that Giuffre was not the victim\nof sex crimes perpetrated by, among others, Maxwell and J effrey Epstein (“Epstein”). (l5-cv- |\n7433, Dkt. No. l.) Boies Schiller represented the plaintiff in the litigation, and continues to :\nrepresent her on a pending post-setlement appeal, which is described belou. |\nOn March 3, 2ol6, Maxwell moved before the assigned judge, the Hon. Robert W.\nSweet, for entry of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for materials produced in discovery, Maxwell cited |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo875\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4925 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004926.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3of 27\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal\nstatutory and common law privacy concerns. (Dkt. No. 38 at l.) Maxwell submited a proposed\nform of order for Judge Sweet’s consideration. (Dkt. No. 39-l.) |\nGiuffre represented that she “[did] not oppose the entrance [sic] of a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in |\nthis case, but [did] oppose a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in the form proposed by Defendant because it is |\noverly broad and can lead to abuse and over designation[.]” (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 4o at 2.) |\nGiuffre redlined Maxwell’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, deleting some provisions and (insofar as |\nis relevant) adding language to paragraph 4— stating that confidential information “shall not be :\ndisclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case”’—to provide that |\nconfidential materials also could be disclosed with impunity “in any related mater, including but :\nnot limited to, investigations by law enforcement.” (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 4l-5 § 4.) Maxwell |\nopposed these modifications. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 49.) |\nAt a hearing held on March l7, 2ol6, Judge Sweet concluded that “of course” a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was warranted. (Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66, at 4:25—5:l.) He gave no |\nreason, but as Maxwell made her motion on the basis of privacy concerns, and Giuffre consented |\nto entry of some form of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for the same reason, I assume that Judge Sweet found !\nprivacy concerns to constitute good cause—which, given the subject mater of the lawsuit, would |\ncertainly have been warranted.\nJudge Sweet did not, houever, resolve any of the disputes between the parties about what |\nshould or should not be in the order. Instead, he directed the parties to come up with an |\nagreement to which everyone could stipulate. (/d. at 5:l—-l2.) By the end of the hearing, Giuffre, |\nwho was eager to take Maxwell’s deposition, agreed to the form of order originally proposed by |\nMaxwell. (Id. 9:7-24.) The court agreed that it would “so order” Maxwell’s proposed version :\nSDNY_GM_ooooo876 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4926 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004927.jpg": "‘ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 27\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal\npursuant to the parties’ stipulation. Judge Sweet made no specific findings about any provision\nof that order. Ud. 9:25—lo:6.)\n\nOn March l8, 2ol6, the court formally entered the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. )\nNo. 62.) It provided, as such orders generally do, that any documents, materials and/or |\ninformation designated confidential by the parties (the “Confidential Materials”) would be |\nsubject to the protections of, and could be disclosed to non-parties only in accordance with the |\nterms of, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. (Id. §§ l-5.) The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order also required all parties, at the |\nconclusion of the case, either to return to the party who made the confidentiality designation, or |\n(in the alternative) to destroy, each document and all copies of Confidential Materials in their |\npossession. (Ic. 5-7, l2.) This destruction obligation extended to the parties’ lawyers as well |\nas to the parties themselves. Ud. § l2.) |\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order specified that if Confidential Materials were contained in any |\ndocument presented to the court, the filing “shall be accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant |\nto Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of |\nNew York.” (/d. $lo.) The docket sheet in Giuffre v. Maxwell reveals that such motions were |\nfrequently made and routinely granted. As a result, a vast amount of the Giuffre Action was |\nconducted, in effect, in secret—despite the fact that there was immense public interest in the |\nmater. | |\nThe Giuffre Action was setled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint |\nstipulation for dismissal on May 25, 2ol7, which was shortly before the trial was to begin. (l5- .\nev-7433, Dkt. No. 9l9.) The terms of the setlement remain confidential. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt.

Atacks on the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order |\n\nBoth during and after the setlement of the Giuffre Action, third parties made highly- |\npublicized applications to have documents that were filed under seal by order of Judge Sweet |\nunsealed and made public. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 362, 55o, 935.) Harvard Law professor and |\ncriminal defense lawyer Alan Dershouitz, whom Giuffre publicly alleged of perpetrating sex |\ncrimes alongside Epstein, moved to unseal a limited portion of the record in order to clear his |\nname. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 364 at l.) Alt-right activist and provocateur Michael Cernovich |\nalso sought to unseal the papers filed as part of Maxwell’s motion for summary judgment, |\narguing, “Cernovich Media cannot conduct its Forth [sic] Estate function if this Court allous the |\nParties to conduct theit dispute outside of the normal sunlight of transparency and accessibility.” |\n(l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 55l at l.) The Miami Herald Media Company and investigative journalist |\nI\n\nJulie Broun, whose feature story about Epstein recently garnered significant public interest, also |\nmoved post-setlement to unseal the entire record. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 936.) |\nAll such applications were denied by Judge Sweet. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 439 (sealed), |\n\n892, 953.) A consolidated appeal from the orders denying the unsealing motions is currently |\npending before the Second Circuit. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. l8-2868 (2d Cir.), On March 6, :\n2ol9, the Court of Appeals heard argument on the consolidated appeal, which was widely |\ncovered in the legal press. I think it is fair to say that during the argument, the panel seemed |\ncritical of the district court’s failure to make specific findings about why any particular document :\nas to which unsealing was sought should remain sealed. For example, Circuit Court Judge Jose |\nA. Cabranes stated that Maxwell’s lawyer “[couldn’t] possibly be serious” when he argued that |\nno documents should be made public, even after the case had setled.! |\nl Priscilla DeGregory, Documents related to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein may be unsealed, N.Y.

(l8-2868, Dkt. |\nNo. l38.) The docket reveals that responsive filings were in fact delivered to the Court of |\nAppeals; no further order has been entered in the Second Circuit. |\nThe consolidated appeal relates only to the unsealing of what would, but for the |\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order and Judge Sweet’s repeated decisions to permit materials to be filed under seal |\nand his refusal to unseal those materials on the motions of the Intervenors, be publicly available |\nin the files of the court. They do not address materials that may be in the files of the parties or |\ntheir counsel. |\nC. The Government’s Application :\nIn late November or early December 2ol8, the Government commenced an investigation |\ninto Epstein and others for unlawfully trafficking minors, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, |\nl594(c) and unlawfully enticing minors in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b). (Sealed Aff. and |\nAppl. of AUSA Alex Rossmiller dated Feb. 5, 2ol9 (““Gov’t Appl.”), Dkt. No. l, § 3.) ;\nAs part of that investigation, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller\n“requiring the production of copies of discovery and related materials in [the Giuffre Action].” |\n(Gov’t Appl., J 5.) These materials are arguably subject to the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. |\nOn February 5, 2ol9, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |\nSweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § l65l(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order so that it could respond to the subpoena. The Government represented in that |\napplication that Boies Schiller was willing to comply with the subpoena but for the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> :\nSDNY_GM_ooooo879 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4929 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004930.jpg": ": Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7 of 27\n\n: To Be Filed Under Seal\nOrder. (Leter from AUSA Alex Rossmiller to the Hon. Robert W. Sweet, dated Feb. 28, 2ol9 |\n(“Gov’t Leter Br.”), Dkt. No. 2, at l.) |\nJudge Sweet asked for further briefing. On February 28, 2ol9, the Government |\nsubmited a leter brief in camera, to which it appended a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order and a |\nproposed order granting the relief requested. (See Gov’t Leter Br.) Neither the initial |\napplication nor the subsequent leter brief was initially filed with the Clerk of Court. |\nPrior to ruling on the Government’s application, Judge Sweet died. The open application |\nwas referred to me. |\nI directed that a miscellaneous docket number be assigned to the Government’s :\napplication and that all materials theretofore sent to Judge Sweet’s chambers be filed under seal.” |\nI also held two conferences in which I questioned the U.S. Atorney’s Office about the |\napplication. |\nII. The Government’s Application, While Irregular, Is Granted 2\nA. Procedural Irregularities Atendant to This Application |\nIn the ordinary course, one would expect this application to arise in a different procedural |\nposture. |\nFirst, one would have expected Boies Schiller, the recipient of the subpoena, to have |\neither (l) moved for relief from the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, or (2) moved to quash the subpoena. See |\nIn re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d l22l, l225 (2d Cir. |\nl99l) (“The proper procedure .., is... to subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a |\npending proceeding such as a grand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised |\n2 All materials under this docket number, l9-mc-l49, including this opinion, will be kept under seal as |\nrelated to a pending grand jury investigation. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo88o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo493o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 27 |\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. Permissive |\nintervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o |\n(2d Cir. l986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |\nTel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l, 294 (2d Cir. l979)], that ‘this extraordinary writ [mandamus] would |\nhardly be available ... where the only purpose was to obtain modification of a pretrial order for |\ninvestigative purposes.’”), Or it could have filed a writ of mandamus, since “mandamus lies to |\ncompel a judge to unseal documents shoun to be material and necessary in litigation,” United |\nStates v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 423 (2d Cir. l983). But the Government has done neither of the |\nabove; instead, it has moved pursuant to the All Writs Act. It cites no authority for that |\nprocedure. |\nNonetheless, there is precedent in this Circuit for granting procedurally puzzling :\napplications by the Government to unseal materials for use by a grand jury. For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations. Jd. at 42o-2l. On appeal, the Second Circuit rejected the defendant- |\nappellants’ argument that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting the |\nGovernment’s application: “A court may direct access to such material upon a proper shouing of\nSDNY_GM_ooooo882\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4932 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nneed. Here such a shouing was amply demonstrated. To have refused access to these records in |\nthe face of a subpoena from a grand jury would have been an abuse of discretion.” Jd. at 423. |\nI will, therefore, consider the Government’s application. |\nB. The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., lo4 |\nF.R.D. 559, 57o (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd, 82l F.2d l39 (2d Cir. l987) (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d |\nat 295). The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nand that such an order should not be vacated or modified merely to accommodate the |\nGovernment’s desire to inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal |\ninvestigation[.]” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.\nSince Martindell, “It is well-setled [in this Circuit] .. . that a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order |\n\nmay be overturned or modified [only] based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary |\ncircumstances or compelling need.” Andover Data Servs., a Div. of Players Computer, Inc. v. |\nStatistical Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir. l989). Moreover, the Second Circuit |\nhas held that Martindell applies to the Government, as well as to any other third party seeking to |\nmodify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229 n.7. |\nThe Government argues that Martindell should not apply to the instant application, for |\n\nthree reasons. (Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-5.) |\nFirst, it argues that the rule of Martindell is inapplicable because here the grand jury |\n\nissued a valid and proper subpoena to Boies Schiller, while in Martindell the Government “‘was |\nproceeding outside of its usual investigative pouers to secure the requested testimony, not by |\ngrand jury subpoena,’ Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422.” (See Gov’t Leter Br. at 3-4.) Houever, the |\nstatement from Davis that is quoted above concerned the testimony of a non-party appellant |\nwhose testimony was not subject to a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, but rather to an informal )\n“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing. Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422. |\nThe opinion underscored that the parties’ unwriten understanding about the confidentiality of\nthis deponent’s testimony would not trump a formal grand jury subpoena. That discussion is |\nirrelevant to the question of whether this Court is required to apply the Martindell rule in |\nevaluating this application. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo884 |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4934 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004935.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 27\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nSecond, the Government argues that Martindell does not apply when “as here, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is on its face temporary or limited.” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 4.) But the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder in this case is at least arguably not temporary or limited. It would have expired had the |\ncase gone to trial, but, as the case setled, it appears to me to bind the parties permanently. It is |\ntrue that nothing in the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order seems to prevent either Giuffre or Maxwell from |\nmaking public documents that were designated confidential by that party once the lawsuit is |\nover. Houever, as to documents designated confidential by the other party, the promise of |\nconfidentiality plainly survives termination of the lawsuit—even to the point of requiring that :\nthose materials be returned or destroyed. ;\nThird, the Government argues that applying Martindell to its application here “would risk |\nrendering | Martindell] in even further conflict with the well-reasoned decisions of numerous |\nother Circuits,” (Gov’t Leter Br. at 5 n.3.) Martindell is indeed an outlier; every other Circuit |\n|\nthat has considered the clash between <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders and grand jury subpoenas has questioned |\nits wisdom and has come up with a standard more favorable to the Government’s position. See |\ngenerally Dane L. Steffenson, Are Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Orders Viable Against Grand Juries?, |\n26 Golden Gate U. L. Rev. l83 (l996); 8A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2o44.l (3d ed. Nov. 2ol8). |\nI happen to agree with the other Circuits, but Martindell is the law in this Circuit, and I am not at |\nliberty to ignore it. |\nThe Government argues that the Court should decline to analyze its request pursuant to |\nMartindell in light of Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54 F.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), |\nLike this case, Chemical Bank arose in a somewhat unusual posture: a party to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order |\nunilaterally approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office, “suggesting that it had :\nevidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” Jd. at 93. The District Atorney then issued |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo885 !\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4935 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004936.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l3 of 27\n: To Be Filed Under Seal\n\na grand jury subpoena, with which the party (the defendant) complied. At no point did the\ndefendant seek relief from the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Id. When the other party to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order |\nlearned of the defendant’s blatant disregard of its obligations, it moved for sanctions in the civil |\naction. Id.\nThe district court condemned the defendant’s behavior as “entirely unnecessary and |\ninappropriate,” but nonetheless refused to sanction the defendant—apparently because, had the |\ndefendant sought relief from that order, the judge would have granted its request. Jd. at 93-94, |\nWhile the Martindell factors were never mentioned expressly by the district court, Judge |\nBroderick observed that the confidentiality order did not implicate “technological trade secrets, |\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which |\ncould benefit rivals”—factors that, if present, he would have had more difficulty balancing |\nagainst the investigative needs of law enforcement. Id. at 94. |\nThere are three reasons why Chemical Bank does not justify this Court’s refusing to |\napply the Martindell factors to the Government’s application. First and foremost, the opinion of ,\nanother district judge does not trump an opinion from the Second Circuit. Second, while a reader |\nof Chemical Bank cannot be certain whether the district court complied with Martindell, the |\n|\nlanguage quoted above certainly suggests that the district court engaged in the balancing exercise |\nthat Martindell contemplated. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that the Government’s |\ninvestigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I will return later |\nin this opinion. |\nThe Court will, therefore, analyze the Government’s request in light of the Martindell |\nfactors. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo886 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4936 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004937.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l4 of 27\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nCe On the Current Record, the Court Cannot Find That the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order\nWas “Improvidently Granted”\nUnder Martindell, a Rule 26(c) <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order may be modified, for among other\nreasons, where a party can shou “improvidence in the grant.” 594 F.2d at 296. While the\nGovernment has not moved for modification on these grounds, I address this factor in light of the\ncurrent proceedings before the Second Circuit.\nThe term is not well understood. See United States v. Taleo Contractors, Inc., l53 |\nF.R.D. 5ol, 5ll (W.D.N.Y. l994) (observing that the Circuit “provided no guidance as to what |\nmight constitute ‘improvidence in the grant of a... <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order’”). To date, the Second |\nCircuit has identified two ways in which an order might be considered “improvidently granted.” |\nThe first is, essentially, that it was issued in bad faith. Houever, this is a high bar. For example, |\na sealing order is “improvidently granted” where the presiding judge “reasonably should have |\nrecognized that [it] would facilitate or further criminal activity.” Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 865-66. |\n|\nBut there is absolutely no evidence that the district court harbored any such realization; indeed, |\nat the time Judge Sweet entered the Order, it appeared that criminal activity against Maxwell and\n|\nEpstein was a thing of the past.* Nothing in the record indicates that the entry of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\n2 In 2oo7, financier Jeffrey Epstein plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court, arising from\nallegations that he “assembl[ed] a large, cult-like network of underage girls-—with the help of young female\nrecruiters” (including Maxwell)—whom he coerced into performing sex acts “behind the walls of his opulent\nwaterfront mansion,” among other locations, “as often as three times a day.” Julie K. Broun, Hou a future Trump\nCabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime, Miami Herald (Nov. 28, 2ol8),\nhtps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article22oo97825.html. The deal also included a non-prosecution\nagreement with the Department of Justice, which immunized Epstein and four named accomplices from all federal\ncharges, broadly immunized “any potential co-conspirators,” and—in contravention of federal law—kept the\nagreement secret from Epstein’s victims. Jd. Epstein served just thirteen months in county jail, during part of which\nhe was permited to continue working from his dountoun office. Jd.\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published a series of feature articles describing the allegations\nagainst Epstein and suggesting that the plea deal constituted Government misconduct. Liam Stack, U.S. Opens\nInquiry Into Handling of Jeffrey Epstein’s Sex Abuse Case, N.Y. Times (Feb. 6, 2ol9),\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2ol9/o2/o6/us/fbi-jeffrey-epstein.html. The expose garnered atention from the media\nand from Congress and has apparently prompted an investigation by the Department of Justice. Jd. Whether the\ngrand jury subpoena arose out of this renewed interest in Epstein’s behavior is ultimately not relevant to the Court’s\ndecision—but it seems likely.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo887 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4937\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l5 of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nOrder itself facilitated or furthered criminal activity; and the record contains no evidence of bad\nfaith. |\nThe second way in which a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order might be “improvidently granted” is if the :\npresiding judge did not require the moving party to shou “good cause” for entering an order that :\npermited documents to be filed with the court under seal. It was long the law that the parties |\nneeded to make a document-by-document shouing of good cause whenever discovery materials |\nwere filed with the court under seal. Jn re Agent Orange Prod. Liab, Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l48 |\n(2d Cir. l987) (Agent Orange). |\nIn recent years, houever, the Second Circuit has relaxed the Rule 26(c) “good cause” |\nshouing for discovery materials that are never filed with the court, in light of changes to the |\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233 n.ll. The new, more lax |\nstandard recognizes that, “Without an ability to restrict public dissemination of certain discovery |\nmaterials that are never introduced at trial, litigants would be subject to needless annoyance, |\nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. |\nMotorola, Inc., l65 F. App’x 878, 88l (2d Cir. 2oo5) (summary order) (emphasis added) |\n(quoting TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229). |\nAs a result, the “good cause” shouing necessary for entry of a blanket pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> |\norder like the one entered in Giuffre is not onerous. Dorset v. Cty. of Nassau, 289 F.R.D. 54, 67 |\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). “[W]here “a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (l) is entered on a shouing of good cause as |\nrequired by Rule 26(c), (2) is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and (3) does not |\nrestrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other sources,” it is not improvidently |\ngranted.

Mar. l5, 2olo) (order was not improvidently granted where “parties were concerned\nabout exchanging commercially sensitive material with their direct competitors”). In fact, at\nleast one district court in this Circuit has held that “stipulated, umbrella confidentiality orders are\nnot per se improvident even if good cause was not shoun.” Int’l Equity Invs., Inc. v.

The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order was granted on the basis of\nlegitimate privacy concerns on the part of both Giuffre and Maxwell, as well as third parties. See\nIn re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., l56 B.R. 4l4, 435 (S.D.N.Y. l993), aff'd, l7 F.3d 6oo (2d Cir.\nl994) (finding “no shouing of improvidence where the justifications for the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Orders\n[were] immediately apparent”), Material turned over in discovery that was ultimately used at :\ntrial would have been publicly available. (<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order § l3 (“This <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order shall :\nhave no force and effect on the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this |\nmater.”).) The Second Circuit may well be on the verge of making material used in connection |\nwith the summary judgment motions publicly available, though of course I cannot predict what |\norder will ultimately issue from the Court of Appeals. And there does not appear to be any |\n|\nproblem with the entry of a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order that specifically contemplates case-by-case |\nconsideration of whether materials filed with the court should or should not be sealed. |\nI have no idea whether Judge Sweet made the requisite findings in his decisions granting |\n|\nthe various motions to seal publicly-filed documents that were made in Giuffre. See, e.g., |\nTheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 23l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“While Martindell established a general and |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo889 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4939 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004940.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l7 of 27\n.

That, I gather, is the subject of the pending appeal. Press reports of the\noral argument suggest that perhaps the necessary findings might not have been made before\ncertain court filings were sealed. I cannot and will not pretend not to knou that the issue is out\nthere. Houever, I knou of no reason why it would have been improper to shield sensitive |\nmaterials from public disclosure before any court filings were made. :\nD. If Any Party Relied on the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in deciding |\nwhether and hou to comply with various discovery requests. The question to be decided is |\nwhether such reliance was reasonable. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004941.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 27\n. To Be Filed Under Seal\n\n“An examination of Second Circuit case law reveals the follouing factors are relevant\nwhen determining whether a party has reasonably relied on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order: (l) the scope of |\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the level of inquiry the court :\nundertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In re Ethylene |\nPropylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 3o8, 3l8 (D, Conn. 2oo9). |\nThe first factor—the scope of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order—favors granting the Government’s |\napplication for modification. As discussed, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more difficult to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. And |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89l |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494l |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order reasonable, as against even disclosure pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order disclosure of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before disclosure can be made. |\n|\nAs the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling disclosure !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nabsence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced from\n\na grand jury’s scrutiny. As the court reasoned in EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l, language stating that\nthe party receiving designated confidential information “shall not use or disclose the information |\nexcept... by such orders as may be issued by the Court during the course of this litigation” did\n“not lend itself to reasonable reliance that [the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order] will afford permanent secrecy.”\n|\nSee also Lugosch v.

(Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66 at |\n4:25-5:l2.). Obviously, I was not there, but I have reviewed the transcript of the argument on |\nthe motion for a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, and it seems clear that the parties were given ample discretion |\nto designate discovery materials as confidential, with virtually no oversight unless those |\nmaterials were to be filed with the court—in which case a motion for sealing had to be made.° |\n(<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order § lo); cf Liton Indus., Inc. v.

The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 27\n\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThis decision accords with those of other courts in this Circuit. “Where a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> |\norder contains express language that limits the time period for enforcement, anticipates the |\npotential for modification, or contains specific procedures for disclosing confidential materials to |\nnon-parties, it is not reasonable for a party to rely on an assumption that it will never be |\nmodified.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32o. More to the point, “Uncertainty about the ultimate |\noutcome of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order will mean that no deponent may always effectively rely on a |\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order to secure his right against self-incrimination.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d |\nat lo84 (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)). |\nBecause Maxwell’s reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order to shield her from the court-ordered |\ndisclosure of Confidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the |\nCourt may exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application. “Where a litigant or |\ndeponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, a court may |\nproperly permit modification of the order. In such a case, whether to lift or modify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> |\norder is a decision commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” TheStreet.Com, 273 |\nF.3d at 23l (internal quotation omited); accord Gambale v.

See Talco Contractors, Inc., |\n\nl53 F.R.D. at 5ll. Houever, the Second Circuit has recognized that this requirement may be |\nmet in circumstances involving significant public interest, particularly where no good cause |\nshouing was made to the court initially. See Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l48 (“exceptionally |\n|\n\npervasive protection granted appellants during the pretrial stages of this litigation, coupled with |\nthe fact that appellants never were required to shou good cause,” as well as the fact that there |\nwas “enormous public interest in the Agent Orange litigation,” demonstrated extraordinary |\ncircumstances); but see Ionosphere Clubs, l56 B.R. at 435 (“[M]ere breadth” of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> |\norder does not, by itself constitute “extraordinary circumstances.”). Indeed, some district courts |\nin this Circuit go one step further, holding that “The heightened Martindell ‘extraordinary |\ncircumstances’ standard . . . is not appropriate in cases with stipulated <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders that grant |\nparties open-ended and unilateral deference to protect whichever discovery materials they |\nchoose.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l. |\nHere, as discussed, no party was required to make a good cause shouing before |\ndesignating any particular discovery materials as confidential. Moreover, there is significant |\npublic interest: the Government has convened a grand jury to investigate a serious crime |\n(potentially involving multiple victims), which from its inception has garnered extensive |\npublicity, and which (most recently) includes troubling allegations of misconduct on the part of |\nGovernment officials, including a then-United States Atorney who is nou a member of the |\nPresident’s Cabinet. The Court agrees with the Government that, because the investigation is not |\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify :\nand to produce documents]... would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the :\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo897 :\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4947 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal.

The underlying motion papers reference the names\nof accusers and potential witnesses who have spoken on the public record in this case and others\nwho have spoken publicly but not associated themselves directly with this case. The Court has\nruled that the existence of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, by itself, is not sufficient to justify redactions, and\nthat any redactions must be justified under the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in\nLugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other\nwitnesses who have chosen to speak to the media about their alleged experiences, including\nregarding the very materials sought by the subpoena, should be publicly disclosed and that it is not\nthe defense’s burden to justify redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seek any\nredactions.

Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l49 (2d Cir. 2ool); Application of National Broadcasting Co.,\n635 F.2d 945, 95l-52 (2d Cir. l98o). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies\nfor evidence submited under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of\ncourt was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at l49 (quoting Application of National Broadcasting\nCo., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared\nin open court, so these cases are inapposite.\n\nTo the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at\n22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006571.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of3\nPage 2\nPlease be advised that the above list is limited to the individuals the Government may refer\nto as co-conspirators at trial.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO <span class=\"highlight\">PROTECTIVE</span> ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO <span class=\"highlight\">PROTECTIVE</span> ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 65 of 68\n———*_ ——— SC, a\nit has a candor obligation to raise this concern with the court, to protect it from relying on false\ninformation.\nI would be happy to discuss my opinion with the Office, if doing so might assist\nits consideration.\nVery truly yours,\nBruce A.

Ms. Maxwell does not seek production of materials\nrelated to other claimants, and there is no reason to think that production of the materials related\nto Ms. Maxwell’s accusers—who have not acted to keep confidential their claims against Mr.\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell—will somehou impair the functioning of the EVCP in working with\nothers. Indeed, the EVCP is nou closed and there is no more work to be done—the cut-off for\nclaims has passed, the money has been paid, and the fund is closed.\n\nMoreover, the lack of an objection by either Accuser-l or Accuser-4 belies the argument\nthat compliance with Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive, at least as\nto them.

This Court and Chief\nJudge McMahon concluded that Ms. Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder’s promise of confidentiality because the order was subject to modification and because of\nthe overriding interest in the “truth-seeking function of the judicial process.” June 25, 2o2l\nOrder, p l3, l7-l8.\n\nIf that is true, then it’s equally true that Ms. Maxwell’s accusers cannot reasonably expect\ntheir submissions to and communications with the EVCP to remain confidential for all time and\nfor all purposes. The EVCP Protocol expressly provides that its confidentiality guarantee is\n“subject to law, regulation and judicial process.” And in view of the “truth-seeking function of\nthe judicial process” and Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense and confront\nher accuses, any remaining interest in confidentiality must give way.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMs. Maxwell’s subpoena is narrou, specific, and targeted. It seeks only that evidence\nwhich is relevant to her defense and admissible at trial. Although the concerns about\nconfidentiality are overbloun, Ms. Maxwell nevertheless has asked that this Court review the\nmaterial in camera before turning it over to the defense.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 85o9(d)(2) (authorizing <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstem/Maxwell victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, §\n377 |(a)(8,) and the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with §\n35o9(d) principles.\n\nIll. Requested Relief\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 377l(a)(5), (c)\\(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data pomts that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards\ncannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Prech, and the CVRA, deny disclosure\nwithout prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\n\nor dignity.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019256.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel8 of l9\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019259.jpg": "Cas6 ds2@¢rats3 DAdin Bbc SitB2o AletPG9/GR)28 aRageiDof 5\nreference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case. For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), a Court may enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nonly after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was warranted.\nSee Dkt. No. 35 at l (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating\nto the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.”). The Defendant’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order included a\nprovision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt. No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 9 l(a), lo(a), l4(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery.\n\nUpon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which\nseeks modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in order to use documents produced in the criminal\n?

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters.

See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool926o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019261.jpg": "Cas6 ds2@¢raot83 Adin Docu SitB2 o AletPG9/GR)28 aRageiHof 5\n\n3.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019274.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagell of l2\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Ghislaine Maxwell, No. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)\nDear Judge Preska:\n\nI write in response to the Court’s Order of August 3, 2o2o (Doc. lo69), the Order and\nProtocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. lo44) (“Protocol”), and to raise with the Court\nthe legal effect of new information that came to the atention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on\nFriday, August 7, 2o2o.\n\nNew information: On Friday, August 7, 2o2o, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of\ncritical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and\nfairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing\norder of July 23, 2o2o. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal\ndefendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nCounsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an\nofficer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because\nit is subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil\nproceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order\nof the Court.” <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) at {¥ l(a), l8 (Exhibit A).

Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order\nin the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with\nthis Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under\nseal if necessary).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool932l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019322.jpg": "Cas@ nS 2i-O7aA Bose Buceim ae l7oo2 Filed2o3/9B/2agPage 2 of 3\nHonorable Loreta A.

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have l5 pages to object to the\nfive motions proposed belou, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to\nkeep it shorter than that, but also allou for more space to provide specifics to the Court.\n\nSecond, we have obtained new contact information for Doe l from a separate civil\nsuit. We believe that Doe l retains a right to notification and participation.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case.

This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019335.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DH29HPabageLot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019337.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-AIm eDoedntal 42o Filed DHI29H PC abagea of 5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

In\nits opposition, the Government explained the factual background regarding the\nconfidential criminal discovery materials at issue. In particular, the Government\nexplained that those discovery materials related to the Government’s requests to\nmodify certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in civil cases to permit compliance with grand\njury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”’). Those Subpoenas were issued to a certain\nrecipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. In order to maintain the integrity\nof the grand jury investigation and in accordance with both Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not notify\nMaxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas,\nthe Recipient advised the Government that it believed that certain existing\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in or about February\n2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019348.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page6 of 24\n\nrequest modification of the respective <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with\nthe Subpoenas. In or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the\nGovernment’s application, and permited the Government to share Court-l’s\norder—and only that order, which itself prohibited further dissemination—to the\nRecipient. Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Government’s\napplication. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain\nunder seal, except that both have expressly permited the Government to produce\nthose filings to Maxwell as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case.\n\n6. After providing that factual background, the Government\nargued that Maxwell’s motion should be denied for failing to shou good cause to\nmodify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order for several reasons. First, Maxwell had consented to\nthe portions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order that prohibit use of criminal discovery\nmaterials produced by the Government in any civil litigation. Second, Maxwell\nhad cited no authority to support the argument that a criminal defendant should be\npermited to use criminal discovery in civil cases.

In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite\n“fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had offered “no more\nthan vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions” regarding why the criminal\ndiscovery materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases.

When applying the collateral-order doctrine, the Supreme Court\nhas “generally denied review of pretrial discovery orders.” Firestone Tire &\nRubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (l98l).

Discussion\n\nl6. There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and\nthus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that\nconstitute immediately appealable collateral orders. Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S.\nat 522. Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrou category of\ncollateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019356.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel4 of 24\nrule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be\ndismissed. Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).\nAmong other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for\nidentifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order\nbeing appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omited)\n(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468). Accordingly, this Court does not\nhave jurisdiction to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nl7. As an initial mater, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this\nCourt cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts\nof this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim\nbelongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7 (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nCoopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\nInc., 5ll U.S. 863, 868 (l994)). Here, like any other order regulating the use of\ndiscovery materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s\nOrder declining to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in this criminal case is not subject\nto interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26.\nl8. There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within\nthe four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable\nprejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy,\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019358.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel6 of 24\nappeal from unsealing of competency evaluation because “any alleged incursions\non criminal defendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not render the unsealing\norder effectively unreviewable on appeal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district\ncourt’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because “[rJeversal\nafter trial, if it is warranted, will adequately protect . . . interest[s]” asserted by\ndefendant); cf’ Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at lo9 (holding that orders to disclose\nprivileged information are not immediately appealable even though they “intrude[]\non the confidentiality of atorney-client communications”).\n\n2o. To the extent Maxwell complains that unsealing filings in a\ncivil case may result in unfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, such a concern\nis not an issue that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\nIndeed, that very issue has been reviewed by this Court in multiple cases on post-\njudgment appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 2l5, 232-34 (2d\nCir. 2olo) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased the\nvenire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 5l5 F.3d loo, l28-3l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (evaluating\non post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial jurors). Should the Court\ndetermine that the jury at Maxwell’s trial was biased based on disclosure of\nmaterial in a civil case, and that such material would not have been unsealed had\nJudge Nathan permited modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, then vacatur of the\ndefendant’s conviction — if warranted — will adequately vindicate the defendant’s\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019359.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel7 of 24\n\nright to an impartial jury. See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol-o4,\n2l3 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (vacating conviction where district court improperly refused to\nexcuse potential juror who admited bias based upon knouledge of defendant’s\nprevious acquital). Thus, the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury would\nnot “be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S.\nat 799 (internal quotation mark omited) (quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435\nU.S. 85o, 86o (l978)), and, as such, the Order does not meet the third criterion for\nappealability of a collateral order. See Punn, 737 F.3d at l4 (defendant’s interests\n“can be adequately vindicated upon appeal from a final judgment” through “a new\ntrial... or whatever additional remedies are necessary”).\n\n2l. Simply put, the Order denying Maxwell’s motion to amend the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal. Maxwell complains\nthat if she cannot use criminal discovery materials in civil litigation then there is a\nrisk that certain filings in the civil cases may be unsealed that otherwise would\nhave remained sealed. Maxwell apparently believes such a result would risk\nprejudicing her trial rights in the criminal case. If such materials are unsealed in\nthe civil case, and if Maxwell believes that unsealing causes her prejudice at her\ncriminal trial, Maxwell will have a full opportunity to raise that issue in the\ncriminal case. To the extent Maxwell is concerned that unsealing in the civil case\nmight permit the Government to oppose any motion challenging the unsealing\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019361.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Pagel9 of 24\nthe appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment\nrulings.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo6 (alterations in original) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller,\n472 U.S. 424, 436 (l985)).\n\n23. The cases cited in Maxwell’s notice of appeal do not alter this\nanalysis. All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors —\nnot parties — seeking to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in civil cases. See Pichler v.\nUNITE, 585 F.3d 74l, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2oo9) (third party intervernor foundation\nappealing order denying motion to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in civil litigation to\nallou third party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v.

Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those cases\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oool936l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019363.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page2l of 24\nthese reasons alone, the Court should deny Maxwell’s motion to consolidate these\nappeals.\n\n27. Maxwell has filed two separate appeals challenging two\ndifferent orders by two different district judges. But Maxwell’s consolidation\nmotion makes plain that her goal — in both appeals — is to ask this Court to rule\non an entirely different question: the lawfulness of the Government’s applications\nto modify certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in other judicial proceedings. Maxwell’s\nstrategy is procedurally improper, for at least two reasons. First, none of the\napplications or orders with which Maxwell takes issue are before this Court for\nreview — the civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s unsealing order, and this\ncriminal appeal concerns Judge Nathan’s Order denying Maxwell’s request to\nmodify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate offers no coherent\nexplanation of the connection between the legality of the Government’s prior\napplications and those two appeals. Indeed, as Judge Nathan found, Maxwell has\nfailed to explain, despite a high volume of “heated rhetoric,” hou those\napplications could have any possible impact on Judge Preska’s decision to unseal\nfilings in the civil litigation. (Ex. F at 3). Second, if Maxwell seeks to challenge\nthe manner in which the Government gathered evidence in a criminal investigation,\nneither the civil appeal nor this interlocutory criminal appeal is the appropriate\nforum for her arguments on that score. Maxwell will have the opportunity to raise\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019364.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page22 of 24\nany legal objections to the Government’s evidence before Judge Nathan, who is\npresiding over the criminal case. If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s\nrulings on those maters, she will have a full opportunity to appeal those rulings\nafter entry of final judgment in her criminal case. The Court should not permit\nMaxwell to raise these issues at this juncture, before they have been fully litigated\nbefore and adjudicated by the presiding district judge.\n\n28. Moreover, Maxwell’s motion to consolidate is a transparent\natempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this\nappeal. That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits\nMaxwell from using certain criminal discovery materials in civil litigation. If this\nCourt were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in\nboth cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in\nthe manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge\nNathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without\nrequiring Maxwell to shou that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by\ndenying Maxwell’s motion to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order.” Indeed, Maxwell’s\nmotion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left\n* Moreover, if the appeals were consolidated, the sealed filings in this criminal\nappeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal. The Government is\nconcermed that consolidating these maters would entail disseminating sensitive,\nsealed documents in a criminal case to civil litigants.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oool9364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019367.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel of 23\n\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n~ oe ee eee eee eee eee eee x\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA > AFFIRMATION\n\nAppellee, :  Dkt.

On July 3o, 2o2o, upon the Government’s application, Judge\nNathan entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order governing the parties’ disclosure of information\nproduced in discovery in the criminal case (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order’).

The <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span>\nOrder further provides that any discovery material produced to Maxwell by the\nGovernment that is marked “confidential” may not be filed publicly or excerpted\nwithin any public filing. (/d. 4 l5). Maxwell’s criminal defense counsel consented\nto the foregoing provisions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. (See Dist. Ct. Docket Entry\n29).\n\n4. On August l7, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a motion before Judge\nNathan seeking an order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order to allou Maxwell to use\nconfidential criminal discovery materials, which were produced to Maxwell by the\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-oool9369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019370.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Page4 of 23\nGovernment, in filings Maxwell intended to submit in separate civil litigation.\n(District Court Docket Entry 52).

On August 2l, 2o2o, the Government filed an opposition to\nMaxwell’s motion to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. (Dist. Ct. Docket Entry 46). In\nits opposition, the Government explained the factual background regarding the\nconfidential criminal discovery materials at issue. In particular, the Government\nexplained that those discovery materials related to the Government’s requests to\nmodify certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in civil cases to permit compliance with grand\njury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”’). Those Subpoenas were issued to a certain\nrecipient (the “Recipient”) in connection with a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. In order to maintain the integrity\nof the grand jury investigation and in accordance with both Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 6(e) and its standard practice, the Government did not notify\nMaxwell or her counsel of the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas,\nthe Recipient advised the Government that it believed that certain existing\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in or about February\n2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool937o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019371.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Paged of 23\n\nrequest modification of the respective <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with\nthe Subpoenas. In or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the\nGovernment’s application, and permited the Government to share Court-l’s\norder—and only that order, which itself prohibited further dissemination—to the\nRecipient. Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the Government’s\napplication. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain\nunder seal, except that both have expressly permited the Government to produce\nthose filings to Maxwell as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case.\n\n6. After providing that factual background, the Government\nargued that Maxwell’s motion should be denied for failing to shou good cause to\nmodify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order for several reasons. First, Maxwell had consented to\nthe portions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order that prohibit use of criminal discovery\nmaterials produced by the Government in any civil litigation. Second, Maxwell\nhad cited no authority to support the argument that a criminal defendant should be\npermited to use criminal discovery in civil cases. Third, Maxwell uterly failed to\nexplain hou the criminal discovery materials at issue supported any legal argument\nshe wished to make in civil litigation. The Government also noted that to the\nextent Maxwell sought to challenge the process by which the Government sought\ncompliance with the Subpoenas and obtained certain materials that it intended to\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool937l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019372.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Page6 of 23\n\nuse in prosecuting its criminal case, she would have a full opportunity to do so in\nher pretrial motions in the criminal case before Judge Nathan.\n\n7.

In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite\n“fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had offered “no more\nthan vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions” regarding why the criminal\ndiscovery materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases.

Accordingly, even\nthough Judge Nathan “remain[ed] in the dark as to why this information will be\nrelevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, Judge Nathan expressly\npermited Maxwell to inform the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic series of events set forth in paragraph 5, supra.

Appeals Involving Injunctions\n\nl5. Title 28, United States Code, Section l292(a)(l) provides that\nCourts of Appeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i|nterlocutory orders of the district\ncourts of the United States . . . or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing,\nmodifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify\ninjunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.”\nOrders regulating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched “using words of\nrestraint,” are not injunctions and are therefore not appealable under § l292(a)(l).\nSee Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (“<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> orders that only regulate materials\nexchanged between the parties incident to litigation, like most discovery orders, are\nneither final orders, appealable under 28 U.S.C. § l29l, nor injunctions, appealable\nunder 28 U.S.C. § l292(a)(l).” (internal citations omited)); Caparros, 8oo F.2d at\n26.\n\nB. Discussion\n\nl6. There is no dispute that the Order is not a final judgment and\nthus is not appealable unless it fits within the “small class” of decisions that\nconstitute immediately appealable collateral orders. Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S.\nat 522. Because the Order does not fall within the extremely narrou category of\ncollateral orders that are appealable in criminal cases, where the collateral order\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool9378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019379.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel3 of 23\nrule is “interpreted . . . ‘with the utmost strictness,’” the appeal should be\ndismissed. Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265).\nAmong other things, the Order does not meet the third criterion of the standard for\nidentifying immediately appealable collateral orders, which requires that the order\nbeing appealed from be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522 (internal quotation mark omited)\n(quoting Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 468). Accordingly, this Court does not\nhave jurisdiction to review the Order, and Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.\n\nl7. As an initial mater, when evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, this\nCourt cannot engage in an “individualized jurisdictional inquiry” based on the facts\nof this case, but instead must focus on the “entire category to which a claim\nbelongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7 (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nCoopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 473; Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\nInc., 5ll U.S. 863, 868 (l994)). Here, like any other order regulating the use of\ndiscovery materials exchanged by the parties during litigation, Judge Nathan’s\nOrder declining to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in this criminal case is not subject\nto interlocutory appeal. See Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 24-26.\nl8. There can be no serious suggestion that this Order falls within\nthe four categories of orders that the Supreme Court has identified as appealable\nprejudgment in criminal cases, as the Order does not address bail, double jeopardy,\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019381.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel5 of 23\nappeal from unsealing of competency evaluation because “any alleged incursions\non criminal defendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not render the unsealing\norder effectively unreviewable on appeal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district\ncourt’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because “[rJeversal\nafter trial, if it is warranted, will adequately protect . . . interest[s]” asserted by\ndefendant); cf’ Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at lo9 (holding that orders to disclose\nprivileged information are not immediately appealable even though they “intrude[]\non the confidentiality of atorney-client communications”).\n\n2o. To the extent Maxwell complains that unsealing filings in a\ncivil case may result in unfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, such a concern\nis not an issue that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\nIndeed, that very issue has been reviewed by this Court in multiple cases on post-\njudgment appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 2l5, 232-34 (2d\nCir. 2olo) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased the\nvenire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 5l5 F.3d loo, l28-3l (2d Cir. 2oo8) (evaluating\non post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial jurors). Should the Court\ndetermine that the jury at Maxwell’s trial was biased based on disclosure of\nmaterial in a civil case, and that such material would not have been unsealed had\nJudge Nathan permited modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, then vacatur of the\ndefendant’s conviction — if warranted — will adequately vindicate the defendant’s\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oool938l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019382.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel6 of 23\n\nright to an impartial jury. See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol-o4,\n2l3 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (vacating conviction where district court improperly refused to\nexcuse potential juror who admited bias based upon knouledge of defendant’s\nprevious acquital). Thus, the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury would\nnot “be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial,” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S.\nat 799 (internal quotation mark omited) (quoting United States v. MacDonald, 435\nU.S. 85o, 86o (l978)), and, as such, the Order does not meet the third criterion for\nappealability of a collateral order. See Punn, 737 F.3d at l4 (defendant’s interests\n“can be adequately vindicated upon appeal from a final judgment” through “a new\ntrial... or whatever additional remedies are necessary”).\n\n2l. Simply put, the Order denying Maxwell’s motion to amend the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal. Maxwell complains\nthat if she cannot use criminal discovery materials in civil litigation then there is a\nrisk that certain filings in the civil cases may be unsealed that otherwise would\nhave remained sealed. Maxwell apparently believes such a result would risk\nprejudicing her trial rights in the criminal case. If such materials are unsealed in\nthe civil case, and if Maxwell believes that unsealing causes her prejudice at her\ncriminal trial, Maxwell will have a full opportunity to raise that issue in the\ncriminal case. To the extent Maxwell is concerned that unsealing in the civil case\nmight permit the Government to oppose any motion challenging the unsealing\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019384.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Pagel8 of 23\nthe appellate courts do not repeatedly intervene to second-guess prejudgment\nrulings.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo6 (alterations in original) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Firestone, 449 at 374; Richardson-Merrell Inc. v.

All three are inapposite because they involved appeals by intervenors —\nnot parties — seeking to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in civil cases. See Pichler v.\nUNITE, 585 F.3d 74l, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2oo9) (third party intervernor foundation\nappealing order denying motion to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in civil litigation to\nallou third party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v.

Maxwell has filed two separate appeals challenging two\ndifferent orders by two different district judges. But Maxwell’s consolidation\nmotion makes plain that her goal — in both appeals — is to ask this Court to rule\non an entirely different question: the lawfulness of the Government’s applications\nto modify certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in other judicial proceedings. Maxwell’s\nstrategy is procedurally improper, for at least two reasons. First, none of the\napplications or orders with which Maxwell takes issue are before this Court for\nreview — the civil appeal concerns Judge Preska’s unsealing order, and this\ncriminal appeal concerns Judge Nathan’s Order denying Maxwell’s request to\nmodify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate offers no coherent\nexplanation of the connection between the legality of the Government’s prior\napplications and those two appeals. Indeed, as Judge Nathan found, Maxwell has\nfailed to explain, despite a high volume of “heated rhetoric,” hou those\napplications could have any possible impact on Judge Preska’s decision to unseal\nfilings in the civil litigation. (Ex. F at 3). Second, if Maxwell seeks to challenge\nthe manner in which the Government gathered evidence in a criminal investigation,\nneither the civil appeal nor this interlocutory criminal appeal is the appropriate\nforum for her arguments on that score. Maxwell will have the opportunity to raise\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019387.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 38, o9/l6/2o2o, 2932233, Page2l of 23\nany legal objections to the Government’s evidence before Judge Nathan, who is\npresiding over the criminal case. If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s\nrulings on those maters, she will have a full opportunity to appeal those rulings\nafter entry of final judgment in her criminal case. The Court should not permit\nMaxwell to raise these issues at this juncture, before they have been fully litigated\nbefore and adjudicated by the presiding district judge.\n\n28. Moreover, Maxwell’s motion to consolidate is a transparent\natempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this\nappeal. That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits\nMaxwell from using certain criminal discovery materials in civil litigation. If this\nCourt were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in\nboth cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in\nthe manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge\nNathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without\nrequiring Maxwell to shou that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by\ndenying Maxwell’s motion to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order.” Indeed, Maxwell’s\nmotion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left\n* Moreover, if the appeals were consolidated, the sealed filings in this criminal\nappeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal. The Government is\nconcermed that consolidating these maters would entail disseminating sensitive,\nsealed documents in a criminal case to civil litigants.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oool9387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019396.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 54, o9/23/2o2o, 2937o9l, Page3 of 6\ncase and to stay the unsealing process, just as it moved to intervene and to stay\ndiscovery in Doe v.

That is not\nso.

For one thing, Ms. Maxwell does not seek to\nmake anything public. To the contrary, she seeks to provide documents to judicial\nofficers— under seal—to ensure that all the Article III decisionmakers are on the\nsame page regarding the relevant facts and that Judge Preska does not continue to\nremain in the dark. For another thing, this appeal w7// become moot if review awaits\na final judgment in the criminal case, even if the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order continues to have\nprohibitive effect follouing the criminal trial.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl Atachment A to Opening\nBrief\nDOJ-OGR-oool944o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019441.jpg": "Cases e@:2o-626o3BoAuhenDoCuatent 2D 26 jl26 B5/o2/2oage ager at 5\nreference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.

Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is warranted.” To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant\nfactors, including the parties’ reliance on the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and whether the moving party has\nsufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant mater.\n\nOn July 3o, 2o2o, this Court entered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case, having determined\nthat good cause existed.

No. 35 at l (“The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating\nto the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.”). The Defendant’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order included a\nprovision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government “[s]hall be used by the\nDefendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and\nnot for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action.” Dkt. No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 9 l(a), lo(a), l4(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery.\n\nUpon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which\nseeks modification of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in order to use documents produced in the criminal\n? Tn the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” In re Teligent,\nInc., 64o F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation omited).

She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case. And she\nfurnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be\nmade in those maters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in order\nto allou such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those maters.

See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oool9442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019443.jpg": "Caesese@:2o-626o3BoAuNenDoOCuatent 2D 2Ejl26B5/o2/2oagedgea at 5\n\n3. In February 2ol9, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of\nthose civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury\nsubpoenas;\n\n4. In April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”) permited the modification and, subsequently,\nanother court (“Court-2”) did not;\n\n5. That as a result of the modification of the civil <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order by Court-l, the\nRecipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order; and\n\n6.

The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could\nconserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil\ncase, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n vy. Abraj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. l9cv3244\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol9). As observed by the Government, the\npending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,\nand may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this\ncase. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has\nsome interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have\nbeen brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are\ncurrently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may\nbe imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil\ncase were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to\ninformation in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise\ndiscovery here. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information\nabout the criminal mater is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has\nentered a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that\nMaxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information’); see\nalso 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures,\nthat, due to the terms of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited\nfrom disclosing certain information in the civil case).)\n\nThus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019459.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 6l, o9/24/2o2o, 293828o, Page2 of l25\nTable of Contents\n\nDocket Sheet ...........::csceesceesceesseeseeeesneeseeesaeeeseeeseeesaeesaeeesaeesaeesaeeeeeeseeeseeeees ool-ol2\nol7 Superseding Indictment (7.lo.2o)...........:ssesesseeeeeeeeeeeeteseeseeeeeeeeeeeseees ol3-o3o\no27 Defts Ltr.

To optimize the\nquality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, and counsel for\nthe Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access the audio\nof the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet platform\nsystem, only one atorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of the\npress, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in\nnumber, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order.\nGiven the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding\nwill be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick\nMoynihan Courthouse, 5oo Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing\nrequirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional\npersons will be admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone\nwho appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature\ntaken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, atached. Completing\nthe questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who\nmeet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are\nbelou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the\nnose and mouth must be worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-\nl9 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.\nThere are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,\nif possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the\nDefendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able\nto sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-l74 of\nMarch 27, 2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least\n24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an\ninquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court\nto add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The Court\nwill inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate\nlogistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email\nwithin 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on\nthe question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and\nJuly 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in\ntransferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the\nCourt further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July l4, 2o2o.\nDue to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds\n\"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A).

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities.

No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v.

The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?3477o8277l29655-L_l_o-l PP. 9/l2\nDOJ-OGR- oool9468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019469.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pmyG7ReO2OcetB@828o2 Paget2 of l25\ncriminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many\nrestrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy\nAct of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to\nscrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide\npotential witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.\nSee Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be\nsubject to examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them\nby the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing reasons,\nthe Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be entered on the\ndocket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully request that the Court enter a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the form atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nThe government has indicated that it requires the entry of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order before\nproducing any discovery material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nApp.o39\nDOJ-OGR-oool9498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019499.jpg": "OGsedl AZADA S BOs ATT thd MAE 2o2 F ib 2AY/PagPkyefi2l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019500.jpg": "OGsedl ZADAeO SBOs ATT thd WARE 2o2 F i627 /PagPeyefisl ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the\nlanguage in the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.\nEpstein, see United States v. Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019501.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden thc WHE 2o2 F iRB6 2A /PagPayei4l ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Government and defense\ncounsel have conferred regarding a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order several times via telephone and email between\nJuly 9, 2o2o, and today, including as recently as this morning. The Government and defense\ncounsel have come to an agreement on much of the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Houever, the\nparties disagree as to two inclusions sought by the defendant which the Government objects to and\nfor which, as detailed herein, the Government submits there is no legal basis. Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court enter its proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (the\n“Government Proposed Order”), which is atached hereto as Exhibit A, and which differs from the\ndefendant’s proposed order in those two respects, as further described belou.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Request to be Permited to Publicly Name and Identify Victims\n\nAs detailed herein, the Government seeks to protect the identities of victims, consistent\nwith their significant privacy interests and the well-established law in this Circuit, and proposes a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order consistent with those very significant interests. In contrast, the defendant insists\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order be modified such that she and her counsel would be permited to “publicly\nreferenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken on the public record to the media or in public\nfora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” !\n\n' Specifically, the defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a sentence, in its paragraph 6 (which is paragraph 5 of the Government Proposed Order),\nstating the follouing: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing\nindividuals who have spoken on the record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal\nor otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” The defendant also either adds\nApp.o56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019516.jpg": "CGsedl ADA SBos ATT (dc WAG 262 F iB 628/PAg Ragei2i 457\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019517.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 62728/PAg Kalyeisi B67\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nApp.o6o\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019520.jpg": "Odsedl ADA SBos ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 628/PAg Kayei6l 257\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019521.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT (hdc WHE 262 F iB 6228/PAg Ragei7l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But there is no basis to add\nadditional restrictions upon the Government’s use of materials gathered by the Government itself.\nThe defendant’s only counter-argument, as noted—that this Court should put third parties\n“on equal footing with the defense’—is both unlikely to be relevant given the Government’s\nstandard practice, as described above, and, the Government submits, an irrelevant consideration in\nthe context of a criminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nApp.o87\nDOJ-OGR-oool9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019547.jpg": "Cased ADAH SBos AT en dc WHE 362 FiRABOZ2o/Pageiyef2l ab3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt. No. 33-l, 95.

And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019550.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden (hdc WHE 262 F iB 68h /Pageayef2l ab5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas’”’). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nApp.o9l\nDOJ-OGR-oool955o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019551.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos ATT (hdc WARE 262 F i688 /Pageageisi ab5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\nApp.o92\nDOJ-OGR-oool955l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019552.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden thd WHE 262 F i68l /Pag eeigei4l ab5\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (holding that the need to “maintain\nthe secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain\nsentencing documents).\n\nFourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal\ndefendant should be permited to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2o2o WL l49588o, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nApp.o93\nDOJ-OGR-oool9552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019553.jpg": "CGsedl ZADaKeO SBOs ATT tid WHE 262 F iB 688ol /Pag eeeiyei5s! ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case.

The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

For\nthe reasons that follou, Defendant’s requests are DENIED.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), a Court may enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nonly after it finds that good cause exists.

To the contrary, the controlling case in this Circuit, Martindell v.

Similar cases in this district demonstrate the “non-standard” nature of the\ngovernment’s conduct regarding these subpoenas.

That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a\nprocess for the government to seek civil materials subject to <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders for use in grand\njury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the\ngovernment is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the\ngovernment has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government\ncontends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented.

Ms. Maxwell also requests leave to be excused from publicly filing a\nredacted version of Appendix Volume 2 on ECF. As grounds for this request,\nMs. Maxwell states:\n\nThis appeal addresses an order by Judge Nathan declining to modify a\ncriminal <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. A related case, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3,\naddresses an order by Judge Preska unsealing certain deposition material. Ms.\nMaxwell has filed a motion to consolidate both appeals.

Ms. Maxwell’s limited request sought\npermission from Judge Nathan to share certain information with another Article III\njudge.\n\nThe government contends this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Judge\nNathan’s order. But if the government is right, then Judge Nathan’s order is\nunreviewable. The collateral order doctrine is not so rigid.\n\nWhile an interlocutory appeal is the exception and not the rule, all the\nconditions required to satisfy the collateral order doctrine exist here. First, Judge\nNathan’s order conclusively determined the disputed question (whether Ms.\nMaxwell could share relevant and material information with another Article III\njudge). Second, Judge Nathan’s order resolved an important issue completely\nseparate from the merits of the action (whether it is proper for one Article III judge,\nat the request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information\nrelevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a mater before her).\nAnd third, Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final\njudgment (by the time of a final judgment, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the\ndeposition material will have gone into effect and Judge Preska will have ruled on\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019594.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Page3 of l5\nother unsealing requests and Ms. Maxwell’s intended motion to stay the unsealing\nprocess, all without the benefit of knouing information relevant to those decisions).\n\nFinally, the exercise of jurisdiction here adheres to the purposes of the\ncollateral order doctrine. The validity of the order can be assessed nou without\nwaiting until the trial is complete, and nothing about this appeal delays the criminal\ncase.\n\nAlternatively, for the reasons given belou, this Court can exercise\nmandamus jurisdiction to correct the district court’s clear abuse of discretion.\n\nArgument\nI. This Court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review a\ndistrict court decision declining to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.

Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.,\n5o6 U.S. l39, l44 (l993)).\n\nThe district court’s order declining to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order meets all\nthree requirements: the court conclusively decided not to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder, App. 99-lo3; the propriety of modifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order is completely\nseparate from the merits of the government’s criminal allegations against Ms.\nMaxwell; and appellate review of the order will be impossible follouing final\njudgment because a post-judgment appeal will be moot since, by that time, Judge\nPreska’s decision unsealing the deposition material in Giuffre v. Maxwell, Nos. 2o-\n24l3 (2d Cir.)/l5-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y.) will have gone into effect.\n\nThat is the very point of this appeal, after all: to share with Judge Preska the\ncritical new information Ms. Maxwell has learned before it’s too late.

See Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 268. There is nothing about\nMs. Maxwell’s request to share information with Judge Preska that must wait until\nthe criminal trial is over. To the contrary, waiting until the criminal trial is over will\nmoot the issue.\n\nThird, this appeal does not and will not delay the criminal case, which is\nproceeding apace despite the proceedings before this Court. See zd. at 264\n(explaining that interlocutory appeals in criminal cases are generally disfavored\nbecause of the “societal interest in providing a speedy trial”).\n\nThe government’s contentions to the contrary rely on two easily\ndistinguishable cases and misunderstand Ms. Maxwell’s arguments on the merits.\nStart with the two cases on which the government relies. Doc. 37, p ll (citing\nUnited States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. l986); United States v. Pappas,\n94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d Cir. l996)). According to the government, Caparros and\nPappas hold that “<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders regulating the use of documents exchanged by\n\n‘ That the criminal case is proceeding on course despite this appeal confirms\nthat this appeal involves an issue completely separate from the merits of the\ncriminal action.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool9598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019599.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Page8 of l5\nthe parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.” Doc. 37,\np ll. That is not correct.\n\nIn Caparros, this Court dismissed an appeal of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order issued in a\ncriminal case preventing the defendant from making public certain documents\nallegedly concerning public safety. 8oo F.2d at 23-24. According to the defendant,\nthe prohibition on public disclosure was an unconstitutional prior restraint of\nspeech. Jd. at 24. This Court dismissed the appeal because it did not satisfy the\nthree conditions precedent to interlocutory review, in particular the requirement\nthat the issue must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Jd.\nat 24-26. Said the Court:\n\n[The issue] will not become moot on conviction and sentence or on\n\nacquital because the order will have continuing prohibitive effect\n\nthereafter and the purported right to publish the documents, to the\n\nextent it nou exists, will also continue. This is not a situation where an\n\norder, to be reviewed at all, must be reviewed before the proceedings\n\nterminate. Nor is there any allegation of grave harm to appellant if the\n\norder is not immediately reviewed.\n\nId. at 26 (internal citations omited).\n\nThis case is not like Caparros. For one thing, Ms. Maxwell does not seek to\nmake anything public. To the contrary, she seeks to provide documents to judicial\nofficers—under seal—to ensure that all the Article III decisionmakers are on the\nsame page about the relevant facts and that Judge Preska does not continue to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool9599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019600.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Page of l5\nremain in the dark. For another thing, this appeal mz// become moot if review awaits\na final judgment in the criminal case, even if the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order continues to have\nprohibitive effect follouing the criminal trial. That’s because what Ms. Maxwell\nseeks is permission to share information with Judge Preska nou, information that\nshould be part of Judge Preska’s decisionmaking in the unsealing process and any\ndecision whether to stay that process. And unless Ms. Maxwell can share the\ninformation nou, the request will become moot because there is no way to “re-\nseal” a document Judge Preska prematurely unseals without the benefit of knouing\nall the facts.\n\nPappas also doesn’t help the government. In Pappas, this Court dismissed in\npart an appeal challenging a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order prohibiting the defendant from\ndisclosing classified information he obtained from the government as part of\ndiscovery. 94 F.3d at 797. At the same time, the Court accepted jurisdiction over the\nportion of the appeal that challenged the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order’s bar on disclosure of\ninformation the defendant acquired from the government before the litigation. Jd.\nat 798. This Court distinguished the differing results based on the breadth of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order’s ban. /d. As this Court said, “to the extent that the order\nprohibits Pappas from disclosure of information he acquired from the Government\nprior to the litigation, the order is not a typical <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order regulating\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool96oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019603.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 69, o9/28/2o2o, 294o2o6, Pagel2 of l5\nis that, unless the unsealing order is reversed, she likely won’t be able to “properly\nlitigate” the Martindell issue at all.\n\nNor is this appeal the proper forum for deciding whether the government\nimproperly circumvented Martindell. All Ms. Maxwell seeks here is an order\nallouing her to share with Judge Preska information that is essential to her decision\nto unseal the deposition material and to rule on a motion to stay, information Judge\nPreska did not knou at the time and information the government insists should be\nkept from her. And that issue—whether it is proper for one Article III judge, at the\nrequest of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information\nrelevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a mater before her—is\nproperly reviewed on an interlocutory basis because it is “‘an important issue\ncompletely separate from the merits of the action.” Will, 546 U.S. at 349.\n\nII. Alternatively, this Court can exercise mandamus jurisdiction.\n\nAssuming Ms. Maxwell cannot appeal Judge Nathan’s order under the\ncollateral order doctrine, this Court should exercise mandamus jurisdiction and\nissue a writ of mandamus directing the district court to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nas requested by Ms. Maxwell. E.g., Wilk v. Am. Med.

Utreras,\n585 F.3d lo6l, lo68 n.4 (7th Cir. 2oo9); see Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (recognizing that\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in criminal cases “[i]n rare instances . . . might raise issues\navailable for review via a petition for writ of mandamus”).\n\nA writ of mandamus issued under the All Writs Act “confine[s] the court\nagainst which mandamus is sought to a lawful exercise of its prescribed\njurisdiction.” Jn re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal\nquotations omited). A writ is properly issued when “exceptional circumstances\namount] toa... clear abuse of discretion.” Jd. (internal quotations omited).\n\nThree conditions must exist for this Court to issue a writ of mandamus:\n\n(l) the petitioner must demonstrate the right to issuance of the writ is clear and\nindisputable; (2) she must have no other adequate means to atain the relief\ndesired; and (3) the issuing court must be satisfied the writ is appropriate. Jn re\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Albany, N. Y., 745 F.3d 3o, 35 (2d Cir. 2ol4). All three\nconditions exist here.\n\nFirst, as explained in her opening brief, Judge Nathan clearly abused her\ndiscretion in declining to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order.

In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the\nRecipient advised the Government that it believed\nthat certain existing <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders precluded full\ncompliance. (A. 9l). Accordingly, in or about February\n2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal\nto each relevant court to request modification of the\nrespective <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders to permit compliance with\nthe Subpoenas. (A. 9l). In or about April 2ol9, one\ncourt (“Court-l”) granted the Government’s applica-\ntion, and permited the Government to share Court-l’s\norder—and only that order, which itself prohibited fur-\nther dissemination—to the Recipient.? (A. 9l). Subse-\n2 The Government notes that this entire litiga-\ntion took place months before Judge Preska was as-\nsigned to handle Giuffre v.

(A. 9l).\n\nAfter providing that factual background, the Gov-\nernment argued that Maxwell’s motion should be de-\nnied for failing to shou good cause to modify the Pro-\ntective Order for several reasons. First, Maxwell had\nconsented to the portions of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order that\nprohibit use of criminal discovery materials produced\nby the Government in any civil litigation. (A. 9l-92).\nSecond, Maxwell had cited no authority to support the\nargument that a criminal defendant should be permit-\nted to use criminal discovery in civil cases. (A. 98).\nThird, Maxwell uterly failed to explain hou the crim-\ninal discovery materials at issue supported any legal\nargument she wished to make in civil litigation.\n(A. 94).

(A. 93-94).\nD. Judge Nathan’s Order\n\nOn September 2, 2o2o, Judge Nathan issued the\nOrder denying Maxwell’s motion. (A. 99-lo3). In that\nOrder, Judge Nathan noted that despite “fourteen-sin-\ngle spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had of-\nfered “no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory\nassertions” regarding why the criminal discovery ma-\nterials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil\ncases. (A. lol). Judge Nathan concluded that absent\nany “coherent explanation” of hou the criminal discov-\nery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-\ntended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had\n“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. (A. lol). Further, Judge Nathan\nnoted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce\nin civil litigation were already made public through\nthe Government’s leter in opposition to her motion.\n(A. lol-o2). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan\n“remain|[ed] in the dark as to why this information will\nbe relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases,\nJudge Nathan expressly permited Maxwell to inform\nthe tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of\nthe basic factual background regarding the confiden-\ntial criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. lol-o2).\nE. Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order\n\nOn September 4, 2o2o, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-\npeal from the Order. (A. l2l-23). On September lo,\n2o2o, Maxwell filed a motion to consolidate this appeal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool962o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019625.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Pagel8 of 37\nl2\n\nhas consistently ruled that <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders regulat-\ning the use of documents exchanged by the parties dur-\ning a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory ap-\npeal. See, e.g., United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23,\n24 (2d Cir. l986) (“We hold that this collateral protec-\ntive order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § l29l\n.... ); United States v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798 (2d\nCir. l996) (“To the extent that the [<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>] order\nimposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of mate-\nrials exchanged in the course of pending litigation, it\nis not subject to appeal.”); see also H.L. Hayden Co. of\nN.Y. v. Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o (2d\nCir. l986) (‘The district court’s denial of modification\n[of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order] does not fall within the ‘collat-\neral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”). Because “a litigant\ndoes not have an unrestrained right to disseminate in-\nformation that has been obtained through pretrial dis-\ncovery,” such <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders do not amount to an im-\npermissible prior restraint under the First Amend-\nment. Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 25. Even where a litigant\nraises a colorable argument that a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order vi-\nolates a litigant’s right to release documents outside of\ncriminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right can\nawait final judgment on the underlying charges” be-\ncause the “purported right at issue is not related to any\nright not to stand trial.” Jd. at 26.\nB. Discussion\n\nMaxwell’s jurisdictional arguments run afoul of\nthis Circuit’s precedent and offer no justification for\nincluding the Order in the “small class” of decisions\nthat constitute immediately appealable collateral or-\nders. See Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522. In her\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9625\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019626.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Pagel9 of 37\nl3\n\nopening brief, Maxwell concedes that her appeal of the\nOrder does not concern one of the four types of pretrial\norders that the Supreme Court has identified as satis-\nfying the collateral order doctrine in criminal cases,\nbut she fails to offer a basis for expanding those cate-\ngories to embrace her claim here. (Br. l2.) The rights\nimplicated by the Order—namely, the use of pretrial\ndiscovery materials—do not justify expanding the lim-\nited collateral order exception, which is “interpreted\n... with the utmost strictness.” Midland Asphalt, 489\nU.S. at 799.\n\nMaxwell relies principally on three cases in seeking\nto overcome decades of Supreme Court precedent nar-\nrouly construing the exception to the requirement that\nappeals in criminal cases be from the final judgment\nof conviction. As discussed in the Government’s Motion\nto Dismiss, the cases Maxwell cites do not support the\nexistence of an exception here. All three cases involved\nappeals by intervenors—not parties—seeking to mod-\nify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in civil cases. Pichler v.

Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those\ncases was founded on the principle that when interve-\nnors seek access to sealed records, “orders denying ac-\ncess are final as to the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyra-\nmid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll7 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(emphasis added). Once the courts in those cases de-\nnied the intervenors’ motions to modify <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> or-\nders, there was nothing left for those intervenors to Lit-\nigate. Here, by contrast, Judge Nathan’s Order did not\nend the entire litigation as to Maxwell. To the con-\ntrary, Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in\nDecember 2o2o and to proceed to trial in July 2o2l.\nWhen considering interlocutory appeals from rul-\nings on <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders governing a criminal defend-\nant’s use of discovery materials, by contrast, this Court\nhas concluded it lacks jurisdiction. See Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. Maxwell cites no\ncase in which this Court has found jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory appeal of an order regulating the use of\nmaterials a criminal defendant received during litiga-\ntion, and her efforts to distinguish Pappas and Capar-\nros fall short. Pappas concluded that where a protec-\ntive order “prohibits . .. disclosure of information [a de-\nfendant] acquired from the Government prior to the\nlitigation, the order is not a typical <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\nregulating discovery documents and should be appeal-\nable because of the breadth of its restraint.” Pappas,\n94 F.3d at 798 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nDOJ-OGR-oool9627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019628.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page2l of 37\nl5\n\ntype of <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order at issue here. To the contrary,\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in this case expressly provides\nthat its provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-\ning disclosure of any information, with the exception\nof victim or witness identifying information, that is\npublicly available or obtained by the Defendant or her\nDefense Counsel form a source other than the Govern-\nment.” (A. 84-85). Instead, the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26. The Court also concluded that the protec-\ntive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal\nafter final judgment and emphasized that the defend-\nant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order\nis not immediately reviewed.” Jd. So too here. Maxwell\nhas not articulated any serious injury she will suffer if\nthis Court dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical\nharm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising\nfrom the unsealing of filings in a civil case. Should any\nprejudicial publicity arise, though, Maxwell will be\nfully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry\nof final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 2l5, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether public-\nity biased the venire); United States v.

Accordingly, like the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> or-\nder in Caparros, the Order here will still be reviewable\non appeal after entry of final judgment.\n\nIn evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, the Court should\n“not engage in an individualized jurisdictional in-\nquiry,” but instead focus “on the entire category to\nwhich a claim belongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7. The\nOrder declining to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order is not\nsubject to interlocutory appeal as “[p]rotective orders\nthat only regulate materials exchanged between the\nparties incident to litigation, like most discovery or-\nders, are neither final orders, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l29l, nor injunctions, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l292(a)(l).” Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nMaxwell nevertheless asks this Court to engage in\nan individualized jurisdictional inquiry to justify her\nimmediate appeal. Contrary to Maxwell’s claims, the\nOrder does not meet the third criterion of the standard\nfor identifying immediately appealable collateral or-\nders, which requires that the order being appealed\nfrom be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a fi-\nnal judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522.\nShe likens her claim here to an appeal of an order\ndenying a motion to reduce bail, arguing that her ap-\npeal “will become moot if review awaits conviction and\nsentence.” (Br. l3 (quotation omited)). But that is not\nso. In an order denying a motion to reduce bail, the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9629\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019630.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page23 of 37\nl7\n“issue is finally resolved and is independent of the is-\nsues to be tried, and the order becomes moot if review\nawaits conviction and sentence.” Flanagan, 465 U.S.\nat 266. Unlike a request for bail reduction, houever,\nan order denying modification of a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order\ndoes not become moot upon conviction and sentence.\n“The standard for review set forth in Flanagan is\nnot easily met,” and Maxwell has not done so here. Ca-\nparros, 8oo F.2d at 25. To the extent Maxwell still\nwishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\ndiscovery for other purposes after entry of final judg-\nment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization\nfrom this Court to do so then. If Maxwell complains\nthat her inability to use criminal discovery materials\nin civil maters may result in premature unsealing or\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, she can likewise raise\nthose claims before this Court on appeal after entry of\nfinal judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Martoma, No. l3-48o7, 2ol4 WL 68ll9, at *l\n(2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2ol4) (concluding that even though the\ndefendant’s “personal interest in the privacy of embar-\nrassing information is an interest that, as a practical\nmater, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that in-\nterest is insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal);\nUnited States v.

See Pap-\npas, 94 F.3d at 798; Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 26.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019634.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page27 of 37\n2l\nlook primarily for the presence of a novel and signifi-\ncant question of law... and... the presence of a legal\nissue whose resolution will aid in the administration\nof justice.” In re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d at 939.\n\nAs described belou, the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in issuing the Order.

In reaching her deci-\nsion, Judge Nathan applied the correct legal standard,\nevaluated Maxwell’s argument that she needed to dis-\nclose certain criminal discovery materials to the rele-\nvant judicial officers to “ensure the fair adjudication of\nissues being litigated in those civil mater,” found that\nMaxwell’s proffered reasons for the request were\n“vague, speculative, and conclusory,” and concluded\nthat Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to establish\ngood cause.” (A. lol). At no point did Judge Nathan\nfail to apply established law, and it cannot be said that\nher careful review of the parties’ arguments was not\nwithin the bounds of permissible discretion.\n\nFirst, Maxwell still fails to articulate any legal ba-\nsis for the use of discovery material received from the\nGovernment in a criminal case to litigate a separate\ncivil case. Maxwell expressly consented to the entry of\na <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order prohibiting her from using criminal\ndiscovery materials in civil litigation.7 In her motion\nto modify that <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, Maxwell cited no legal\nauthority for the use of criminal discovery in civil liti-\ngation. Her appeal points to no such authority, and she\n\n7 Maxwell did so knouing that the Government\nhad charged her with perjury in connection with civil\ncases.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9636\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019637.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3o of 37\n24\ndoes not suggest that Judge Nathan commited legal\nerror when issuing the Order denying her motion.\n\nSecond, Judge Nathan did not abuse her discretion\nwhen determining that Maxwell had offered no basis\nfor determining that good cause justified a modifica-\ntion of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order. In her briefing before the\nDistrict Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explana-\ntion of hou the criminal discovery materials could\nhave any conceivable impact on the issues pending in\ncivil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that,\nfor example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery\nargument by the Government should foreclose unseal-\ning in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be\naffected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a sep-\narate criminal case. In the absence of any such expla-\nnation, Judge Nathan’s Order declining to modify the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order did not amount to an abuse of her\nbroad discretion when overseeing an ongoing criminal\ncase.\n\nEven on this appeal, Maxwell still fails to explain\nwhy she needs to use materials relating to the Govern-\nment’s applications seeking the modification of certain\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> orders in other judicial proceedings. As far\nas the Government is aware, the only issue pending in\nthe civil litigation in which Maxwell seeks to use those\ncriminal discovery materials involves whether the\nFirst Amendment requires that certain filings in those\ncases be made available on the public docket. Maxwell\ncannot explain why certain criminal discovery materi-\nals are relevant to the issues pending in those cases or\nhou the manner in which the Government obtained\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019638.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page3l of 37\n25\n\ncertain discovery materials would impact the unseal-\ning analysis under First Amendment principles in a\ncivil mater. Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case. She offers\nno coherent argument for hou the criminal discovery\nmaterials would impact any decision in a civil case.\n\nAt botom, it remains unclear what legal argument\nMaxwell wishes to make in her civil cases based on the\ncriminal discovery materials she has identified or\nwhat relevance those materials have to the litigation\nof those civil maters. Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in order to allou such\ndisclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law. (Br. 27). Maxwell claims\nthat “all [she] seeks in this appeal is the ability to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019640.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page33 of 37\n27\n\n“tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge\nPreska decide whether the information weighs against\nunsealing the deposition material or in favor of a stay.”\n(Br. 3l). To the extent Maxwell seeks to inform Judge\nPreska—or any other judicial officer—of the basic facts\nsurrounding the criminal prosecution and the criminal\ndiscovery materials at issue, the District Court has al-\nready granted Maxwell the supposed relief she seeks\nfrom this Court. Although the District Court did not\nmodify the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order, Judge Nathan authorized\nMaxwell to convey, under seal, to the appropriate ju-\ndicial officer the fact that the Government obtained an\norder from Court-l permiting the Recipient to comply\nwith a subpoena for materials covered by a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder, that Court-2 subsequently denied similar relief\nin another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this in-\nformation (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule\nl6 discovery in this criminal mater.” (A. lol-o2). If\nthe “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-\ncation of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order was to share infor-\nmation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-\nment’s investigative techniques, then her appeal is\nmoot because Judge Nathan has already granted her\npermission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why\nthose facts are not enough.\n\nDespite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-\ngues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-\ncess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her\nright to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As\nalready noted, though, it is a mater of public record\nthat the charges against Maxwell include allegations\nof perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29). Without relying on\nany materials she received through criminal discovery,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool964o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019642.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page35 of 37\n29\nshe can appeal to this Court follouing the entry of final\njudgment in the criminal case.\n\nMaxwell presented Judge Nathan with no coherent\nreason—not to mention good cause—to modify the\nduly entered <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order in this criminal case. In\nthe absence of any explanation of Maxwell’s need to\nuse criminal discovery materials to litigate a civil case,\nJudge Nathan was well within her discretion when de-\ntermining that Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to es-\ntablish good cause.” (A. lol).

That concern, among others, raised a sig-\nnificant risk that proceeding with the civil mater\nwould adversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecu-\ntion against Maxwell. Moreover, the interests of judi-\ncial economy and the public interest in enforcement of\nthe criminal law were served by a stay in the Doe case\nbecause the outcome of the criminal case could resolve\ndisputed issues in the Doe case.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v.

We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.\nAnyone who fails to comply with the COVID—l9 protocols that have been adopted by\nthe Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a\nremote proceeding, the Court finds \"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]\noutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\" l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l6l(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> of the rights of third parties.

The Court firmly expects that\ncounsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this\nCourt's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.l, and the rules of professional\nresponsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further\naction is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an\nimpartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But\nthe Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses\nthat going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of\nviolations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those\nrules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.\n(Signed by Judge Alison J.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Due to social distancing requirements,\nseating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will\nbe admited. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—l9 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who\nappears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the\nproceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their\ntemperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,\natached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon\nentry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire\nand whose temperatures are belou loo.4 degrees will be alloued to enter the\ncourthouse.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.” Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4). The\nCourt will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(l)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from\ntoday through July l4, 2o2o.

The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss\na potential <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in\na manner <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> of the rights of third parties.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt.

There are no exceptions. As\ndiscussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the\nWaiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the\nproceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form\n(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 2o-MC-—l74 of March 27,\n2o2o, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24\nhours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to\nreasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the\ncrime or of any release... of the accused and \"[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any\npublic proceeding in the district court involving release.\" Id. § 377l(a)(2), (4).

So that\nappropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the\nCourt by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim\nwishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between\nthe Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2o2o is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to\nthe delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED.

Due to the recently implemented lockdoun at the MDC, visitation is not\ncurrently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call\nwith legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included\nmodifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the\ndefendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a\nlaptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to\nreview some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her\ndiscovery.\n\no The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the\nlaptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer\nthirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020094.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGANnt DEctIMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBataf 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020095.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGHANt DEctuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBStaf 36\nother inmates in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody. Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the\ndefendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly atuned to any complaints the defendant has raised,\nand follouing initial complaints about the defendant’s diet early in her incarceration, the MDC has\nensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day and has access to commissary from\nwhich she can supplement her diet.\n\nThe MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the\ninstitution and providing the defendant with adequate time and resources to prepare her defense.\nIn that vein, many of the searches the defendant complains of—such as searches after every visit,\nsearches of her cell, pat douns when she is moved, and directing her to open her mouth for visual\ninspection (while the searching staff member is wearing a mask)—are the same searches to which\nevery other inmate is subjected for the security of the institution. MDC legal counsel has assured\nthe Government that MDC staff does not record or listen to the substance of the defendant’s calls\nand visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC staff conducts additional searches or monitoring\nof the defendant, MDC legal counsel has indicated that those steps are necessary to maintain the\nsecurity of the institution and the defendant.\n\nWith respect to the defense concerns regarding COVID-l9, the Government recognizes, as\nit did in its initial bail briefing, that the virus presents a challenge at any jail facility. At least for\nthis defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the defendant\nwas potentially exposed to the virus, she was placed in quarantine, remained asymptomatic, tested\nnegative, and then was released from quarantine. As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the\ndefendant has no underlying health conditions that would place her at greater risk of complications\nfrom COVID-l9. (Tr. 89). For that same reason, the Court should again reject the suggestion that\nthe pandemic warrants the defendant’s release.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020233.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 56, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o7529l, Page2 of 3\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\nwee ee ew ew ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee eee ee x\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : AFFIRMATION\nAppellee, :\n-V.- : Docket Nos. 2l-58, 2l-\n: 77o\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant-Appellant, :\nee. }\nSTATE OF NEW YORK )\nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK : SS.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK_)\n\nLARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l746, hereby affirms under penalty of\nperjury:\n\nl.

Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel2 of 9l\nentered on the docket.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020499.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel3 of 92\nentered on the docket.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the Government obtained them in violation of\nher rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the\nGovernment did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence\ncovered by a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is\nnot entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus\nDENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020634.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nhave no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED.

Maxwell moves to suppress evidence\nobtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation\nagainst her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were\npreviously subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order, the Government obtained them in violation of her\nrights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\nand to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government\ndid not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a\n<span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to\nsuppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES\nMaxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span>\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.5 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*”> As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n372 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\nae Doe, Order to Compel Production and <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\ncual The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\nBia This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021442.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 366 3536o39, Pagel2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\n\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.?”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.3””\n\nFb In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021483.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o7 3536o39, Paged3 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\na6 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021953.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl3 Filed l2/l6/l9 Pagelofl\n& ~~ U.S. Department of Justice\n% = we , United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment,\nCount Four at 7 l5.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the\nindictment.\nB. Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order as to discovery, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9. (ll/25/2ol9 - Docket Minute Entry).\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022065.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 3 of 34\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES\n\nCases\nAmnesty Int’l USA v.

The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period,\nfrom approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day,\nAugust lo, 2ol9, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As\ncharged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated\ncounts of prisoners housed in MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), but nevertheless signed false\ncertifications atesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the\nSHU were conducted from approximately lo:3o p.m. on August 9 to 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nI. Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants’ Request for Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government’s Discovery Production\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a discovery deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022089.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 27 of 34\nsuch, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas’s motion can be denied on that\nreason alone. Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the\ndeliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v.

The\nprivilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative\nprocess privilege); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C.

Supp. 2d 253, 284\n(S.D.N.Y. l998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). “In order for the privilege to apply,\nthe agency record at issue must be (l) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or leter; (2)\npre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.” Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot.

The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate\n\nHis case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Custody.\n\nShirley Skipper-Scot\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nOffice: 646-83622... |\n\nBlack Berry: 646-423l2o.5_|\n\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\n\nThanks.

This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\nDs It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment,\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s\ncircumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be\ndeposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued\n\non good cause shoun.”\n\nfA This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal\ncase from potential emotional harm.

As grounds for said motion, Jane Doe states as follous:\n\nl. On July l9, 2oo6 the State of Florida filed a criminal Indictment against Jeffrey\nEpstein (“Epstein”).\n\n2. Jane Doe, a victim of Epstein’s actions, recently filed a civil lawsuit against\nEpstein. The complaint alleges among other things that Epstein has a sexual preference and\nobsession for underage minor girls. That he engaged in a scheme in which he gained access to\nminor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Jane Doe was\none of Epstein’s victims. She was lured into Epstein’s Palm Beach home under false pretenses\nand was sexually assaulted by Epstein. As a result, Jane Doe suffered injuries, including\nintentional infliction of emotional distress damages.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 35 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031558.jpg": "|\nhaving the victim’s privacy repeatedly intruded upon by process servers seeking her out at her\nemployment and then again, intruding upon her mother.\n\n8. Additionally, during this same time period yet another adult male came to Jane\nDoes’ employment and represented himself as an “atorney” who needed to contract her. Upon\ninformation and belief that person was also an agent of Mr. Epstein’s.\n\n9. It can only be concluded that Epstein and/or his counsel are purposefully\natempting to harass Jane Doe and her mother. These actions are nothing more than a continuous\ninsult to injury upon a young girl who has already been emotionally scarred for life.\n\nWHEREFORE, Jane Doe, by and through Jane Doe’s mother and natural guardian,\nhereby move the Court for a <span class=\"highlight\">Protective</span> Order prohibiting Jeffrey Epstein and/or his counsel from\ncontinuous and systematic harassment.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was furnished by\nFacsimile and U.

Jeffrey Epstein, case no. o8-CV-8o232-Marra/Johnson, United States\n. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. As grounds therefore, Witness Y. Doe\nstates as follous:\n‘ Y. Doe has been subpoenaed for deposition in this case by the Defendant\nJeffrey Epstein. The subpoena schedules the deposition for April 2, 2oo8.\nrs Y. Doe is a victim in this mater who alleges that she was sexually\nassaulted by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein when she was l6 years old. Y. Doe has brought a\ncivil case against Defendant Epstein captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case\n. ' The witness is named here anonymously as “Y. Doe” because of the sensitive\nallegations of sex abuse upon a minor involved in this case.\no7/26/l7 Page 42 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031564.jpg": "- 3o5-93l22oo Herman &Mermelstein, P o4:24:o8 n,m. 3l-o3-2oo8 3/5\nno. o8-CV-8o232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District\nof Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\n5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, :\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s\ncircumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be\ndeposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued\non good cause shoun.”\n\n(3 This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal\ncase from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d l338 (Fla. l993); State v.\nTarrago, 8oo So.2d 3oo (Fla. 3d DCA 2ool). A requirement that a single deposition be\ntaken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary\nemotional harm to Y. Doe.

Dixie Hwy\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\n\nRe: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2oo6CFOo9454A XX\nDear Ms. Belohlavek:\n\nWe have left a number of messages with you to coordinate depositions of our clients in\nthis case, without response. With regard to the depositions of our clients, it is necessary and\nappropriate for the entry of a court order which would require that one deposition be taken of\neach of our clients for use in both the criminal case and the civil case. A single deposition is\nwarranted given that the facts of the sexual assault are common to both the civil and criminal\ncases, and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is the same in both cases. A single deposition is in the\nbest interests of the emotional well being of the victim. In another case we were involved in\nwhere both a civil case and a criminal case were pending, the State Atorney’s office filed a\nmotion for <span class=\"highlight\">protective</span> order in the criminal case pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(l)(l) asking that\nthe depositions in both the criminal and civil case be conducted at the same time.\n\nWe would like to coordinate and cooperate with your office with regard to this issue\nconceming the depositions of our clients. The deposition of is presently\nscheduled for Wednesday, April 2, 2oo8. Please let us knou hou you would like to proceed in\nthis important mater as soon as possible.\n\nStuart S.
