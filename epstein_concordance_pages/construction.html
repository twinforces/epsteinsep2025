Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history”\nas part of first Landgraf step); see also Latab v.

That is not the case here.\n\nAs Judge Katzmann of the Second Circuit has recognized, unambiguous legislative\nhistory should not be disregarded:\n\nWhen courts construe statutes in ways that respect what legislators consider their\n\nwork product, the judiciary not only is more likely to reach the correct result, but\n\nalso promotes comity with the first branch of government.

First, like the Wartime Suspension Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the exception narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the exception is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany exception to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB. The offenses charged in Counts One through Four do not necessarily entail\n\nthe sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.\n\nUnder the “necessarily entails” approach, § 3283 does not apply: None of the charged\ncounts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” See l8\n® Nor has the Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because the issue arose in the context of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the court concluded only that it was “not obvious” that § 3283 required an elements-\nbased approach.

The defendant\ncarries this “heavy burden” because Rule 8(a) already strikes a “balance” between “considerations\nof economy and speed” and “possible unfairness” to the defendant. United States v. Amato, l5\nF.3d 23o, 237 (2d Cir. l994). Accordingly, “the principles that guide the district court’s\nconsideration of a motion for severance usually counsel denial,” Pizarro, 2ol8 WL l737236, at\n*5 (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citation omited), and severance should be granted\n“only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the\ndefendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence,” Zafiro\nv.

Ultimately,\nthe district court in Rioux found that the teaching of Duren and the Second Circuit’s subsequent\ncases is that “the court must assess representativeness in the context of the systematic defect\nidentified by the defendant.” /d. at l568. In that case, the claimed defects were in the <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>\nof the qualified wheel and, therefore, the “relevant jury pool” was the “qualified wheel over the\nlife of the wheel.” /d. at l575.\n\nAffirming that decision, the Second Circuit did not hold that the qualified wheel is\nnecessarily the “relevant jury pool.” Rather, after stating that the relevant jury pool “may be\ndefined by: (l) the master list; (2) the qualified wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a combination of the\nthree,” the Circuit noted that the parties had agreed that the district court properly used the qualified\nwheel over the life of the wheel as the “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657. The court’s\nacceptance of the qualified jury wheel as the “relevant jury pool” for that case—an issue which\nwas not in dispute—does not mean it necessarily must be applied in all cases. Jd. Indeed, in other\ncases where the claim of error was not focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> of the qualified wheel, different\n“relevant jury pools” have been used by the Second Circuit. Most notably, in Biaggi, the main\nthrust of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim was that reliance on voter registration lists\nsystemically excluded African-Americans and Hispanics from jury service—a claim which is\ndirected at the composition of the master wheel—and the Second Circuit identified the district’s\nmaster wheel as the relevant jury pool. United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o).\n\nHere, the defendant claims that “the primary reason” for the alleged underrepresentation is\nthe Government’s “choice to pursue an indictment from a grand jury drawn from the White Plains\nDivision, as opposed to the Manhatan Division . . . .” (Def.

See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2).

(emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective interpretation of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>.\nLike the trial court’s interpretation of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A.

The government’s motion seeks to unfairly capitalize on this Court’s\ndecision largely overruling Ms. Maxwell’s Daubert challenge to the government’s expert, Dr.\nLisa Rocchio. If the government gets its way, Dr. Rocchio will present the jury with a one-sided\nversion of events while Ms. Maxwell will be crippled in her ability to respond. This Court should\nnot permit the asymmetry the government hopes to create.\n\nThere is no dispute that Drs. Dietz and Loftus are supremely qualified in their respective\nareas of expertise.

That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (transcript of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case.

This is plainly inadequate under the rules,\nand the Government cannot litigate the qualifications, reliability, or relevance of unknoun\ntestimony about unidentified documents at this time.\n\nOf course, the Court has the option of permiting the defense to clarify this notice mid-trial\nwhenever the defense receives and reviews the documents they have in mind.

Had property records for the 7l*' Street tounhouse been\navailable, they could have rebuted Jane’s testimony and challenged the accuracy of her\nrecollection.\n\nSimilarly, when Jane testified about her trip to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she\nwas “l5 or l6,” she recalled staying at a “giant ranch sort of in the middle of nouhere ... [which]\nseemed very empty on the interior.” Tr. 32l. From her description, it is clear that Jane was\nreferring to the large ranch house that Epstein constructed on the property, and not the triple-\nwide trailer where he stayed while the large house was under <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>. The defense had\nsignificant reason to believe that the large ranch house was not completed until the end of the\nl99os, when Jane would have been closer to l8 or l9 years old. But because property records\nshouing the dates of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> were not available, the defense could not challenge Jane’s\nrecollection with contrary documentary evidence.\n\nE. Deceased Witnesses\n\nFinally, in the over 2o-year period that elapsed from the time of the charged conduct to\nthe time of trial, numerous potential witnesses who could have provided evidence contradicting\nthe government’s proof had died. In addition to the ones already mentioned in our previous\nfilings, the follouing individuals, among others, were no longer available to the defense:\n\ne Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi — Mr. Pinto and Mr. Salhi were architects who\nbuilt, renovated, and decorated many of Epstein’s residences, including the house\nin Palm Beach, the New York residence, and the ranch in New Mexico. The\ndefense believes they could have established (i) when Epstein moved into the 7l“\nStreet tounhouse and what it looked like inside over the relevant time period, (i)\nwhen the large ranch house was built, and (i) that the Palm Beach residence was\nbeing renovated for almost a year in the mid-l99os and that Epstein had to move\ninto a rental house during renovation. All of this evidence would have cast\nsignificant doubt on Jane’s recollection of events.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 42 of 45\ndefense witnesses died three years or more prior to indictment); United States v. King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper cou/d have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been’’).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant\ndoes not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who\nwere not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals\nwho were unavailable to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could\nprovide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not\nexplain why evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven\nby other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00011794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22 of 247 l5o\nLBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct\n\nl back up the stairs.

The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution for all counts. Maxwell has\nstanding to enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative indication that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021080.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page33 of ll3\n\nthis result was highly counterintuitive, acknouledging that “[a] plea agreement\nwhereby a federal prosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of\nan indictment...might be thought to bar the United States from reprosecuting the\ndismissed charges in any judicial district....” Jd. at 672. Nevertheless, the Court\ndeclared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,” adding, “[a] plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader\nrestriction.” Jd.

Abbasi, l37 S. Ct.\nl843, l857, l859 (2ol7)). In this case, the District Court did not just purport to\nfollou Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable\nterritory. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct\nfrom 2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA. Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count\nSix.\n\nThird, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no\n“affirmative” indication whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021090.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page43 of ll3\n\nthis result would bring the Eleventh Circuit in line with every circuit that has\ndirectly confronted this question (other than the Second Circuit). See Gebbie, 294\nF.3d at 55o; Van Thournout, loo F.3d at 594; Harvey, 79l F.2d at 3o3.8\n\nBecause the NPA was almost certainly negotiated with Eleventh Circuit law\nin mind, it would be unfair to impose another circuit’s minority rule of\n<span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>. A plea agreement must be enforced in accordance with the parties’\nreasonable expectations. See Paradiso v. U.S., 689 F.2d 28, 3l (2d Cir. l982)\n(“The dispositive question is what the parties to [the] plea agreement reasonably\nunderstood to be the terms of the agreement.”) (quoting U.S. v. Arnet, 628 F.2d\nll62, ll64 (9th Cir. l979)). And as this Court has observed, “[p]arties entering a\ncontract will expect ... that the provisions of the contract will be binding”; “[t]heir\nexpectations should not be disappointed by application of [a local rule] which\nwould strike doun the contract or a provision thereof ....”. Eli Lilly Do Brasil,\nLtda. v. Fed. Express Corp., 5o2 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Restatement §\nl88 cmt b).

It would ambush the parties with the law of a circuit that they did not\n8 Alternatively, the NPA might be governed by Florida state law. It is ultimately\nirrelevant whether this Court applies Florida or Eleventh Circuit law. Florida\ncourts, like the Eleventh Circuit, would look to the weight of authority on this\ntopic. See, e.g., Brazeail v. State, 82l So.2d 364 (Fla. App. 2oo2) (follouing the\n“overwhelming weight of authority” among federal circuits on a question of\nfederal law). As noted, the weight of authority rejects Annabi.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021092.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page45 of ll3\n\n(“[D]ue process requires that the government adhere to the terms of any plea\nbargain or immunity agreement it makes”); Harvey, 79l F.2d at 3oo\n(“[C]onstitutional and supervisory concerns require holding the Government to a\ngreater degree of responsibility...for imprecisions or ambiguities in plea\nagreements”). Thus, when the Government promises immunity on behalf of “the\nUnited States,” in a legal context where such promise will be construed to mean\nnationwide immunity, this Court should ensure that the Government keeps its\npromise in accordance with the law of the place where it was made.\n\n3. Annabi does not apply to Count Six because that count falls wholly\n\nwithin the timeframe contemplated by the NPA\n\nEven if Second Circuit law applied, Annabi’s rule of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> is subject\nto an important caveat: the new charges must be “sufficiently distinct” from those\nresolved by the plea “to warrant application of [the] rule.” 77l F.2d at 672.\n“TSufficiently distinct,” in this context, means at least partially encompassing a\ndifferent time period. Jd. Because Count Six relates to a timeframe wholly\nswalloued by the NPA, (Al44), Annabi does not apply to that count.\nThe paragraph within which Annabi articulates its “sufficiently distinct” standard\nresponded to an argument by the defendants that included references to the Double\nJeopardy Clause. The paragraph from Annabi reads, in pertinent part (and with\ncontext supplied), as follous:\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021093.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page46 of ll3\n\nEven if, as appellants contend, the Southern District charges result\n\nfrom the same conspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges\n\ndismissed in the Eastern District, the allegation [in the Southern\n\nDistrict] that the conspiracy extended for an additional two years\n\nsuffices to shou that the new charges are not identical to the\n\ndismissed charges. Therefore, regardless of what degree of preclusive\n\neffect [under the Double Jeopardy Clause] the dismissal of the\n\nEastern District charges would have if the pending charges had been\n\nbrought by the United States Atorney for [the Eastern] District, the\n\n[Southern District] charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant\n\napplication of the Abbamonte-Alessi rule concerning <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> of\n\nplea agreements [viz., that ‘(a) plea agreement binds only the office of\n\nthe United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\n\nentered....\"].”\n\nId.

And under this test, it was dispositive that the later-\nbrought SDNY charges in Annabi alleged a conspiracy period two years longer\nthan the period alleged and resolved in the Eastern District. See id.\n\nWhat this means is that, when new charges stem from “the same” conduct\nthat “underlay” charges resolved by prior plea, Annabi’s rule of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> does\nnot apply unless the new charges also cover a new time period; that is what makes\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021111.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page64 of ll3\ncorroborates Defendant’s interpretation.

This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021114.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page67 of ll3\n\nthe sexual abuse of a child.

The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n\nBinds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.\n\nEmbedded within Annabi’s canon of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> that prosecutors in one\ndistrict cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must\nbe a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention. Thus, if \"it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction,\"\nAnnabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.\nl986).\n\nThe language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which\n(l) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (Al78), (2)\ncontains a structural separation of this clause from the more restrictive language used\nelsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global”\nagreement. Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators\neasily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language.

The Court’s Failure to Hold a Hearing on the Scope of the Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement is an Error.\n\nWhat is significant with regard to this issue is the lack of a sufficient record.\nGiven that the District Court ignored the plain language of the co-conspirator clause\ntogether with the corroborating evidence from the OPR that establishes that that\nlanguage was changed to remove rather than add words of limitation, the District\nCourt’s decision to apply Annabi’s rule of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> without a hearing was an\nerror. This is especially so because the OPR was lacking in relevant information\nfrom defense counsel as to their understanding of the agreement and, in the absence\nof such information, the District Court was obligated to resolve any ambiguities in\nfavor of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe Government argues that, based upon Annabi, there is no need for a\nhearing. But, in fact, courts in this Circuit have routinely recognized the need for\nevidentiary hearings where the scope of an agreement is in dispute. The failure to\nhold a hearing precluded Ms. Maxwell from offering evidence as to the intent and\nunderstanding of defense counsel; as a result, the Court did not construe the NPA\nagainst the Government, as the law requires, but against Ms. Maxwell.

Al73-l79.? In return for pleading guilty to\nstate charges, receiving an eighteen-month sentence and consenting to jurisdiction\nand liability for civil suits under l8 U.S.C. Section 2255, irrespective of where\nthose claims arose, the government agreed, inter alia, not to prosecute Epstein in\nthe SDFL for the offenses from 2ool-2oo7 then under investigation. In addition,\n“the United States also agree[d] that it will not institute any criminal charges\nagainst any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [four\nnamed individuals].” Al78. The co-conspirator clause was negotiated at the same\ntime that the terms of Epstein’s liability for civil claims without geographic\n?

U.S. v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d. Cir. 2o24). The Court,\nquoting Annabi held, that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively\nappears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd at 263. The Court\napplied Annabi even though the NPA had been negotiated in the Eleventh Circuit\nwhere no such contrarian rule of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> exists and did so without benefit to\nMaxwell of discovery or an evidentiary hearing. The Court found that neither the\nplea agreement nor the “negotiation history” shoued that the co-conspirator clause\nwas “meant to” bind other districts. Yet the clause contained no limiting language\nand “several witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not\nto prosecute unidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional\nimmunity” (SAl65). Notably, Maxwell was denied both discovery and a hearing and\nwas therefore left to rely on the NPA and the OPR which was based on documents\nthat were not shared with Maxwell and an investigation that did not include\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021836.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel2 of 5l\ninterviewing Epstein’s lawyers. Notably, the prosecutors could not recall why the\nclause had been added, much less who it was meant to immunize. SAlo4-lo6.\n\nThe Court also relied on the United States Atorneys’ Manual’s directive that\ndistricts not bind other districts without the express writen approval of the United\nStates Atorneys in the affected districts and the Judiciary Act of l789 to suggest that\nUS Atorneys are “cabined to their specific district unless otherwise directed.” ll8\nF.4th at 265.

Annabi should be overruled because\nits canon of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> for interpreting plea agreements conflicts with the\nauthoritative decisions of other circuits that have addressed the issue and stands in\ntension with what the Supreme Court and this Circuit have writen about plea and\nimmunity agreements.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021838.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel4 of 5l\n\nadding, “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for\nthe district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. The Court concluded that,\nbecause the conspiracy alleged in the SDNY indictment “extended for an additional\ntwo years” beyond the date of the conspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, “the\nnew charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule\nconcerning <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> of plea agreements.” Jd.\n\nAnnabi has been sharply criticized. One circuit said it was “unable to discern\na sound basis for the [Annabi] rule,” adding that the decision “really has no\nanalytically sound foundation.” U.S. v.

But, as Gebbie\nexplained, Annabi misread this Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule\nout of whole cloth:\n\nThe first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely\n\nrelies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa ...\n\nThe court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. ...\n\nPapa, houever, provides no support for the rule the Second Circuit\n\nfollous. ...

Unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in the Eleventh\nCircuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and principles of fairness, it would be\nunreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution canon of <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span>, derived from\nthe law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto a plea agreement negotiated with\nprosecutors in a circuit where the very opposite rule applies, i.e. that ambiguities in\nplea agreements are to be resolved against the government.

And this result would\nbring the Eleventh Circuit in line with every circuit that has directly confronted this\nquestion (other than the Second Circuit). See Gebbie, 294 F.3d at 55o; Van\nThournout, loo F.3d at 594; Harvey, 79l F.2d at 3o3.\n\nSecond, Annabi should only apply when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672.

The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N9ooLS registration,\nwas on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently\nacquired the services of a new atorney, and the fact that Epstein's\nhouse is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may\nbe in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,\n358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> crew conducting\nremodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed\ndriving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida\nregistration of F3oQoF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north\non County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr.\nNorr traveled to several <span class=\"highlight\">construction</span> sites and checked on certain\njobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I\ntraveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue\nstripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was.\nvisible on the botom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane.\nWe maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a\ncaravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed\nseveral people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of\nthe executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach\nCounty for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm\nBeach County on May 9, 2oo6 at 9:3o pm and were scheduled to leave on\nthe loth at 5:oo pm.\nOn May l2, 2oo6, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State\nAtorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was\nrequesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to\nher I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen,\nand Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or\ndirect file, as sg much time has elapsed since the original request to\nthe Grand Jury. e explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had\nconcluded the case _in December of 2oo5 and has been waiting for the\ncase to go forward] Belohlavek stated the original offer was again\noffered to the new defense atorney.
