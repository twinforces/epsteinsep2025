The government sets before this court that if the\n\nl2 defendant was willing to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> such measure simply as a\n\nl3 result of an investigation, the potential for dangerous and\n\nl4 obstructive activity in an indicted case is alarming and very\nl5 real.\n\nl6 Despite having been previously convicted of a sex\n\nl7 offense involving an underage victim and being a registered sex\nl8 offender, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove\nl9 of lewd photography of young-looking women or girls at his\n2o mansion. Your Honor, pursuant to judicially authorized\n2l warrants, law enforcement agents searched his home on Saturday\n22 and found at least hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of sexually\n23 suggestive photographs of nude females, many of whom appear to\n24 be underage.\n25 I also want to note that the search revealed specific\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo4l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001204.jpg": "CaSese 2o-ef o S2osAd Me niDoGchnteH) lo22l, ARB l2o5729 e Rage Hof 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\n\nchallenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial\nreview of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure.\nSecondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the\noutcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts.\nThird, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals.

Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3-l Filed l2/23/2o Page 4 of 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\nchallenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial\nreview of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure.\nSecondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, lt is impossible to determine what the\noutcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts.\nThird, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J.

He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature.

As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\nfinancial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span>\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellof 4l\n\nA threshold issue is, of course, whether the witness “is qualified to be an ‘expert’” in the\nsubject mater at issue. See Nimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 396 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oo5).\nTestimony from a qualified expert is admissible only if the trial court determines that it is both\nrelevant and reliable. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589-9o; see Kumho Tire Co., Inc. v. Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37 (l999). Specifically, in Daubert, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence “assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.” 5o9 U.S. at 597. “Daubert applies to both\ndefense and government experts.” United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l48 (2d Cir. 2oo3).\n\nApplying Rule 7o2, the Court must determine whether the expert’s reasoning and\nmethodology underlying his testimony is valid, and whether that reasoning or methodology was\napplied reliably to the facts, so as to be relevant and helpful to the jury. See Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.\nl37. The reliability inquiry is flexible and “must be tied to the facts of a particular case.” Jd. at\nl5o (citations and internal quotation marks omited). The Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘t\nis critical that an expert’s analysis be reliable at every step.” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R.R. Pass. Corp.,\n3o3 F.3d 256, 267 (2d Cir. 2oo2). “In deciding whether a step in an expert’s analysis is unreliable,\nthe district court should <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies,\nthe method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and hou the expert applies the\nfacts and methods to the case at hand.” /d.

Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible\nprejudice against probative force under Rule 4o3 . . . exercises more control over experts than over\nlay witnesses.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595 (quoting authority omited).\n\nAmong other things, the Court “must consider whether an expert’s proposed testimony\nwould usurp the province of the judge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual\ndeterminations.” Island Intell.

While Federal Rule of Evidence\n7o4(a) provides that “[a]n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue,”\nthe Second Circuit has admonished courts to take care “lest [the expert] be alloued to usurp the\nfunction of the judge.” Marx & Co. v. Diners Club, Inc., 55o F.2d 5o5, 5ll (2d Cir. l977).\nAccordingly, courts must not admit “opinions which would merely tell the jury what result to\nreach.” Hygh v. Jacobs, 96l F.2d 359, 363-64 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 7o4 advisory\ncommitee’s note); see also United States v.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining reliability: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its reliability standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and reliability hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nRule 7o4 provides that “[iJn a criminal case, an expert witness must not state an opinion\nabout whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6595", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span>\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008893.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594 Filed o2/o4/22 Pagelof5\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\nN27 United States Atorney\n\n“Seem\n\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

STERNHEIAA\nvictims to be heard, Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not be an open-mike forum for\nany alleged victim.\n\nImpact statements by alleged victims who did not testify, were not referenced in the\nrecord as victims, or do not qualify as “crime victims” under the CVRA should be published\nduring the sentencing proceeding or have their statements included in the record. While the\nCongressional Record is silent on this issue, it is hard to believe that Congress intended the\nCVRA to give voice to anyone and everyone who claims to be a victim but does not qualify\nunder the statute and whose accusations have not been verified. A high-profile case, such as this,\nbecomes a lightning rod for individuals to come forward, especially where to do so may yield\nfinancial reward and media atention. Such an open forum would have significant and adverse\nconsequences to any criminal defendant facing the most critical stage of the case: sentencing and\ndeprivation of liberty.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not a bully pulpit for anyone\nwho was not identified as a victim of the charged federal offenses and does not qualify as such\nunder the CVRA. We urge the Court to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> its role as gatekeeper to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights are not trampled by individuals who are not statutory victims or by the nights\nafforded to legitimate victims under the CVRA. To ensure that the appropriate balance of rights\nis achieved, those who qualify under the CVRA offenses should have the right to be heard but\ntheir statements should be in accordance with redactions and rulings made by the Court.\n\nBecause the Individuals do not meet the definition of \"crime victims\" under the CVRA, they\nshould not be permited to give oral testimony or have their writen victim impact statements\nread during sentencing.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo599", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-3 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of3\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior setlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary\nrequirements.\n\nImportant features of the Program include:\n\nl.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span>, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute.

The Government remains prepared\nto proceed to trial as scheduled. As is set forth more fully belou, while the Government has no\nobjection to a brief adjournment of the trial date subject to the Court’s availability, the requested\nsix-month adjournment is both unnecessary and unwarranted.\n\nBy way of background, as is set forth in the Indictment, the charges in this case relate to a\nperiod of just over l4 hours—from approximately 4:oo p.m. on August 9, 2ol9 to approximately\n6:3o a.m. the follouing day, August lo, 2ol9.

While the December 3l, 2ol9 discovery production consisted of a large\nnumber of pages of materials, many of those materials were produced principally in anticipation\nof defense requests and to help facilitate the very sort of broader investigation the defendants nou\nclaim they need to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span>. For example, the Government produced MCC video surveillance\nfor a period of longer than one month (July 5, 2ol9 to August l2, 2ol9); count slips for nearly\nthree weeks (July 23, 2ol9 to August l4, 2ol9); thirty-minute round reports for more than a month\n(July l, 2ol9 to August lo, 2ol9); and materials relating to the events of July 23, 2ol9.

This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day.

At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages.

The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.

Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v.

Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act.

These inmates\nconsistently reported that the SHU officers did not systematically conduct the counts and rounds as\nrequired on the evening Epstein died and that the last round was either between 9:3o-lo p.m. or l2:3o-\nla.m. Several inmates told the OIG that before Epstein died the SHU staff never conducted rounds at night.\nAccording to the BOP Form 583 Report of Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while\ndelivering the breakfast meal, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Consistent with the required\nresponse to a suspected suicide outlined in the MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders that are\ndescribed in Chapter 2, staff called for assistance and began life-saving measures. At 6:39 a.m., Epstein\nwas taken to the MCC New York Health Services Unit, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived to MCC\nNew York at 6:43 a.m. Epstein was transported to the local hospital, New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital, at 7:lo a.m., and was pronounced deceased at 7:36 a.m.\nAccording to a memorandum atached to the Form 583 from the Clinical Nurse dated August lo, 2ol9, when\nthe medical emergency involving Epstein was called over the radio, the Clinical Nurse immediately\nresponded to the call and upon arrival, saw Epstein on the floor within his cell unresponsive with CPR in\nprogress by COs. The Clinical Nurse’s memorandum reads that Epstein was cold, with circumferential\nbruising around his neck and posterior motling, pupils fixes and dilatated, and no palpable pulses were felt.\nAccording to the memorandum, at 6:35 a.m., a call was placed for EMS, CPR continued, and an AED was\nutilized and indicated “No Shock Advised,” so CPR continued. Epstein was then transported to the MCC\nNew York Health Services Unit treatment room with CPR in progress. Upon arrival, Epstein’s pulse was\nchecked, and the AED indicated “No Shock Advised.” EMS and paramedics arrived on the scene, intubated\nEpstein, and gave him medications and fluids.*® Epstein was transported to the local emergency room with\nCPR in progress at approximately 7:lo a.m.\n45 As noted in Chapter 2, BOP policy provides that the need to immediately atend to an apparent suicide victim,\n<span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence over efforts to preserve a\ncrime scene.\n46 The EMS arrival time on the Clinical Nurse’s memorandum is listed as 6:56 a.m. Based on the OIG’s review of other\ndocumentation and interviews, we believe the arrival time reflected on those other documents (6:43 a.m.) is more likely\nthe time of EMS's arrival. We noted that the Clinical Nurse, at the time of EMS’s arrival, was actively engaged in\nadministering CPR to Epstein and responding to the health emergency.\n\n75\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23442", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023461.jpg": "Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\nI. Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023469.jpg": "email identifying the cellmate requirement; and the statements of multiple witnesses who told the OIG that\nEpstein’s cellmate requirement was widely disseminated verbally by MCC New York leadership.\nB. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct Mandatory Rounds and Inmate Counts\nResulting in Epstein Being Unobserved for Hours Before His Death\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, MCC New York SHU staff did not\nconduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their shift in the SHU. The failure to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span>\nthese required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to\nproperly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further belou—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for\nhours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an\nappropriate cellmate.\nl. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU\nFederal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.””!\nAdditionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that\nfosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.””* Because\n“[i]Jnatention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,”\nBOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.”\nBOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and\ninmate counts.’”? Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and\nensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability\nmeasures, specifying that correctional staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice\neach hour, no more than 4o minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify\nthat at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m.,\n4 p.m., and lo p.m. daily, and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the\nSHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:l5 p.m. on August 9, 2ol9; houever, this inmate transfer\nwas not documented until approximately l2:35 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Based on this internal transfer,\nBOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. SHU inmate counts\non August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which\ndid not shou COs walking up or doun the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a\nprocess that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.”* During their OIG interviews, the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael\nThomas each admited that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU\n™ 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. 8 2635.lol(b)(5).\n7 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n® BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4.\n™ As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of lou quality.

Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to <span class=\"highlight\">Undertake</span> Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000093.tif": "3oa\nserving his sentence not later than January 4,\n2oo8.\n\nl2.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

Suicide Response\nRecognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and\ninmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that\n“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC\nNew York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.\nThese orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the\nsituation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be\ntaken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff\nbelieve that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy\ngoverning crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately atend to an\napparent suicide victim, <span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence\nover efforts to preserve a crime scene.\"?\n5. Inmate Discipline\nFederal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.l-54l.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline\nProgram) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and\norderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline\nprogram applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the\nguiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree\nas necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tatooing or\nself-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This\nprohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines\n“tatooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible paterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect\nby removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cuting falls within this offense).”\"* The\ndefinition does not make an explicit reference to suicide atempts other than inclusion of “wrist cuting.”\nAmong other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,\ndescribes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.\nAs relevant to this mater, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a\nprohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged\ninmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate\nappears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will\nexamine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the\ninmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,\nthe mater is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to\nwhether the inmate commited the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to\nthe severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permited to\nl3 BOP Program Statement 55lo.l4, Crime Scene Management and Evidence Control, is a restricted policy that is not\nreleased to the public in its entirety.\n4 BOP Elements of Prohibited Acts.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023442.tif": "defibrillator. Inmate 6 did not see marks on Epstein’s neck but did see bruising on his face and observed\nearphones that were still in place on Epstein’s ears.\nInmate 7, who was two cells doun from Epstein’s cell and on the other side of the tier, told the OIG that he\ncould not see into Epstein’s cell but he could see the cell door. Inmate 7 said that after dinner was brought\nto Epstein’s cell on the evening of August 9, 2ol9, Inmate 7 did not recall seeing anyone going in or out of\nEpstein’s cell until the follouing morning at around 6 a.m. He further stated that he did not hear any door\n“pop open” that evening.

These inmates\nconsistently reported that the SHU officers did not systematically conduct the counts and rounds as\nrequired on the evening Epstein died and that the last round was either between 9:3o-lo p.m. or l2:3o-\nla.m. Several inmates told the OIG that before Epstein died the SHU staff never conducted rounds at night.\nAccording to the BOP Form 583 Report of Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while\ndelivering the breakfast meal, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Consistent with the required\nresponse to a suspected suicide outlined in the MCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders that are\ndescribed in Chapter 2, staff called for assistance and began life-saving measures.® At 6:39 a.m., Epstein\nwas taken to the MCC New York Health Services Unit, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived to MCC\nNew York at 6:43 a.m. Epstein was transported to the local hospital, New York Presbyterian Louer\nManhatan Hospital, at 7:lo a.m., and was pronounced deceased at 7:36 a.m.\nAccording to a memorandum atached to the Form 583 from the Clinical Nurse dated August lo, 2ol9, when\nthe medical emergency involving Epstein was called over the radio, the Clinical Nurse immediately\nresponded to the call and upon arrival, saw Epstein on the floor within his cell unresponsive with CPR in\nprogress by COs. The Clinical Nurse’s memorandum reads that Epstein was cold, with circumferential\nbruising around his neck and posterior motling, pupils fixes and dilatated, and no palpable pulses were felt.\nAccording to the memorandum, at 6:35 a.m., a call was placed for EMS, CPR continued, and an AED was\nutilized and indicated “No Shock Advised,” so CPR continued. Epstein was then transported to the MCC\nNew York Health Services Unit treatment room with CPR in progress. Upon arrival, Epstein’s pulse was\nchecked, and the AED indicated “No Shock Advised.” EMS and paramedics arrived on the scene, intubated\nEpstein, and gave him medications and fluids.*® Epstein was transported to the local emergency room with\nCPR in progress at approximately 7:lo a.m.\n45 As noted in Chapter 2, BOP policy provides that the need to immediately atend to an apparent suicide victim,\n<span class=\"highlight\">undertake</span> lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence over efforts to preserve a\ncrime scene.\n46 The EMS arrival time on the Clinical Nurse’s memorandum is listed as 6:56 a.m. Based on the OIG’s review of other\ndocumentation and interviews, we believe the arrival time reflected on those other documents (6:43 a.m.) is more likely\nthe time of EMS's arrival. We noted that the Clinical Nurse, at the time of EMS’s arrival, was actively engaged in\nadministering CPR to Epstein and responding to the health emergency.\n\n75\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23442"};
