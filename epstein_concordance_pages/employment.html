See United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 (2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, the\nstatutory demand on defendants “‘is fairly easily met.” United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll). To rebut the presumption, a defendant need\nonly “shou that the specific nature of the crimes charged, or that something about their\nindividual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is true in general is not true in the particular\ncase...” United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986) (quoting United States\nv. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (lst Cir.l985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut the\npresumption is not high.” United States v. Thompson, No. l6-CR-oool9, 2ol8 WL 44733l, at *2\n(M.D. Pa. Jan. l7, 2ol8) (citation omited). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes\nwithin a category listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation of [the presumption], including\nevidence of their marital, family and <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> status, ties to and role in the community, clean\ncriminal record and other types of evidence encompassed in § 3l42(g)(3).” Dominguez, 783 F.2d\nat 7o7 (clean record plus socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).\n\nIn short, evidence that the defendant is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the\npresumption, forcing the government to persuade the court that detention is warranted. See\nConway, 2oll WL 342l32l, at *5 (§ l59l defendant released pending trial). While not\ndisappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor among many in determining\nwhether there are sufficient conditions to “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. See\nMartir, 782 F.2d at ll44; see also United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 89l (8th Cir. l985)\n(“[R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean “guarantee.”). Even in a presumption case, then, “the\ngovernment retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendant presents a danger to the community,” and by a “preponderance” that he poses a flight\n“tisk.” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omited).\n\nI. Mr. Epstein’s l4-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption in\nfavor of pretrial detention\n\nIn this case, any danger presumption atending the § l59l charges evaporates against Mr.\nEpstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2oo5 to date, to both the law’s commands and his rigorous\nregistration and reporting obligations as a convicted sex offender. The indictment does not allege\nthat Mr. Epstein commited any crime in the l4-year interval between the end of the alleged\nconduct and the initiation of this case. The dangerousness prong of the Bail Reform Act is\npredictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will reoffend if released. A spotless l4-\nyear record of walking the straight and narrou, complemented by an exemplary lo-year history\nof diligent sex offender registration and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the\nprior investigation commenced, to conform his conduct to the law’s dictates. The time lag\nbetween the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of a prediction of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000380.jpg": "; SORA HEARING . | page l4 !\n| ‘So l Recency of prior offense less than three years, |\n: 2 they gave him zero. 4 |\n| 3 Drug or alcohol abuse history, they gave him zero. |\n\n4 - “Acceptance of responsibility, they gave him zero. |\n| « § | Conduct wnile confined, they gave him zero.\n| 6 And supervision, they gave him zero. .\n| 7 | Living <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> situation, zero.\n| — Bo They gave him l3o points, which is the highest |\n: 9 level, and I agree with that.\n| lo .

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo992", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001030.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page89 of 2oo 26\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arrest of Mr. Epstein.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001158.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect 6 Gb 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll58", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001173.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeagecd l Ob 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001224.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocA one n Lee Gmeh/ol o4o 2F il @ 4223o) 26a geagfeol 5 G5 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001323.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page6 of 25\n\nby charges involving minor victims and the potential penalties those charges carry.\n(Ud. at 82). Second, Judge Nathan determined that “[t]he government’s evidence at\nthis early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple victims who\nprovided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as\nwell as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.).

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 8 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002177.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l6 of 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3l of 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4-84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A-N, W-X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n4] 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2246", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees.

The Indictment is timely, and the motion should be denied.\n\nC. The Defendant’s Crimes Involved the Sexual Abuse of Minors\n\nThe defendant next argues that Section 3283 does not apply at all, and she asks the Court\nto conclude that the crimes of sexual abuse alleged in the Indictment did not involve sexual abuse.\nHer argument runs contrary to both the case law and common sense. Her motion is meritless and\nshould be denied.\n\nBy its terms, Section 3283 applies to any “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse,\nor kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283. As discussed above, when\nthe statute was first enacted, it was located at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the term\n“sexual abuse” is located in a neighboring provision within that same section:\n\nFor purposes of this section . . . the term ‘sexual abuse’ includes the\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2997", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 239\n\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form\n\nof sexual exploitation of children, or incest with children.\nl8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit conduct” is in turn defined to mean, among\nother things, “sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the term “sexual contact” means\n“the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast,\ninner thigh, or butocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse\nor gratify sexual desire of any person.” Jd. § 35o9(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the definition\nof “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a) to determine whether the statute of limitations of\nSection 3283 applies to an offense. United States v. Carpenter, 68o F.3d llol, llo3-o4 (9th Cir.\n2ol2) (“We join our sister circuits in looking to subsection 35o9(a) for a definition of ‘sexual\nabuse’ under federal law, and find it the appropriate definition to use in applying section 3283’s\nextended statute of limitations.”); United States v. Vickers, No. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA) (HKS), 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *lo (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4) (applying the definition of “sexual abuse” set forth in\nSection 35o9(a)).\n\nAs is evident from its plain text, the definition of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a)\nincludes not only actual “sexual contact,” but also the “the <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, use, persuasion,\ninducement, enticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in,”\nsexual contact. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a). The breadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s\nuse of the word “includes.” The Supreme Court has held that Congress’s choice of the word\n“includes” is “significant because it “makes clear that the examples enumerated in the text are\nintended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S.\nl42, l62 (2ol2) (citing Burgess v. United States, 552 U.S. l24, l3l n.3 (2oo8)).

In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I.

After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C.

Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel.

In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them.

Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo326l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003597.jpg": "Case l:25-cvHOo43G4+RAP Dodooureent264-l6 FHdddlOf/2?67/pl Pagagk84nbl43\nPage 383\nl G Maxwell - Confidential\n2 Q.

The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the applicable definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). But even under such an expansive\ndefinition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nSection 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a child, let alone the\n“<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to engage in any\nsex-related conduct.

Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86 (3d Cir. 2ol5), in which the court rejected the\ndefendant’s comparison of § 3283 to the statute in Bridges. To the extent that the Third Circuit rejected a\n“necessarily entails” approach to § 3283, it appears to have done so without considering the line of Supreme Court\ncases interpreting the “offense involving” language as requiring such an approach—a line that has since expanded to\ninclude Davis and Shular.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003672.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 22\nage—to travel with the requisite intent. l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Section 2423(a) requires only the\ntransportation of a child with the requisite intent, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a); it does not necessarily\nentail “the <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to do\nanything other than travel. Ifa defendant entices an adult to travel for the purpose of engaging in\nunlawful sexual activity, a § 2422(a) offense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a child\nhas occurred. If a defendant transports a minor with the intent (unbeknounst to the minor) that\nthe minor will engage in sexual activity, no sexual activity occurs, and there is no “<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion” to engage in sexual activity, a § 2423(a)\noffense has been commited, but no sexual abuse of a child has occurred.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases in which courts have found § 3283 applicable to\nparticular statutes, it cites only one case in which either a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense has\nbeen held to involve “sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283. In United States v. Vickers,\nNo. l3 Cr. l28 (RJA) (HKS), 2ol4 WL l838255 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2ol4), the court held that a\n§ 2423(a) offense involved sexual abuse, but it did not hold that § 2423(a) necessarily entails\nsexual abuse; instead, the court used a fact-based approach. /d. at *ll (“defendant Vickers is\ncharged with transportation of a minor in violation of [§ 2423(a)] and it is alleged that the\ndefendant did have sexual contact with Victim I”) (emphasis added). No court has held that\neither the enticement of an individual to travel or the transportation of a minor necessarily entails\n“sexual abuse” within the meaning of § 3283. It does not.

In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions.

The Indictment also contains two\nconspiracy counts that charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein. /d. 9] 9, l5.\n\nAccording to the government, houever, Ms. Maxwell’s status as an alleged co-\nconspirator of Epstein is somehou insufficient for an NPA that immunizes “potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein” to apply to her. The government claims that there is “no evidence that\nthe parties intended to confer a benefit on her in particular.” Opp. 2o. In essence, the\ngovernment implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” only those individuals whom the parties were thinking\nabout “in particular” qualify for immunity. The government cites no support for the rule it has\nconcocted, and case law is to the contrary.\nFor example, in United States v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9\n(S.D. Fla. 2ol2), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its\nemployees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a\nthird-party beneficiary by virtue of his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>; the court did not require a shouing that the\nparties thought about protecting that employee “in particular” when they agreed to immunize the\nclass. /d. at l228.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 32 of 349\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law.

When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district.

As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C.

Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that Ihave not met with them.

Why don’t we just move forward?”\nad Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l42 of 349\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 36 of 8o\nknouledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, so long as the probative value of\nthe evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\"° The court then determined that the\ntestimony of the five prior bad act witnesses—and the deposition testimony pertaining to\nthe prior use of Qualudes—was admissible to demonstrate Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design.

No. 455.\n\nAs to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about the line between\npermissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses testifying under a pseudonym.\nThe Government’s suggested level of generality as to permissible cross-examination of the\nwitnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to meaningful\ncross-examination. See United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of\nquestioning the Government identifies may be relevant to a juror’s credibility determination and\nthus the Court will not limit the Defendant’s ability to pursue such questioning on cross-\nexamination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant may not elicit the\nname of a specific employer, but the type and genre of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> may be relevant to the jury’s\nassessment of credibilty.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nThere are two fundamental flaws with the government’s evidentiary proffer regarding\nproposed Exhibit 52. First, as a mater of fact, Government Exhibit 52 was not something that\nthe cooperating government witness reviewed, used, or saw during her brief <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with\nJeffrey Epstein. Records produced in discovery reflect that witness began working for Epstein in\nME At that point, the suspect source of Government Exhibit 52, Alfredo Rodriguez, was not\nemployed by Epstein because he had been fired in 2oo4.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rodriguez, when he left the Epstein home he took an address book,\nwhich he claimed was Epstein’s book, and had it in his possession until 2oo9 when he tried to\nsell it to Brad Edwards for $5o,ooo.' The book was clearly altered by Mr. Rodriguez. The single\n\n' Mr. Rodriguez knew the target of his intended sale which makes the likelihood of\nalteration all the more probable. Mr. Edwards was a lawyer with of the Fort Lauderdale law firm\nof Rothstein Rosenfelt Adler. The firm was under investigation by the U.S. Atorney for the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 49l Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\n2olo), Dkt. No. 32.!\n\nFurther, Employee-l observed the defendant’s contact book in close temporal proximity to\nMr. Rodriguez’s departure. Mr. Rodriguez worked for Epstein in “2oo4 and 2oo5.” Plea\nAgreement/Factual Proffer Statement 4 lo(a), Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM), Dkt. No. 25.7\nEmployee-l worked for Epstein There was therefore no significant time gap\nbetween the day Rodriguez left Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with a copy of the address book and when\nEmployee-l worked for Epstein and saw a copy of the address book. Consider if an employer\ngives a “history of the firm” book to each new employee. An employee who was aware of that\npractice and who starts in 2o2l can authenticate a copy of that book, even if the particular copy\nwas given to an employee who started in 2o2o. Or consider if the Yankees have distinctive team-\nbranded water botles spread across their locker room. A player who has seen the water botles\ncan authenticate one, even if the particular water botle was taken from the locker room before that\nplayer joined the Yankees. The same is the case here. See United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F.\nApp’x 2l, 24-25 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (authenticating “handwriten leters” based on their contents and\n“considerable similarities between the handwriting” and knoun exemplars). Indeed, the fact that\nboth Employee-l and Mr. Rodriguez have seen multiple copies of the same address book further\nconfirms its authenticity.\n\nFinally, the authenticity of the address book does not rely exclusively on Employee-l’s\ntestimony: it is also reinforced by its internal markings. Other evidence at trial will shou that the\naddress book in fact contains the information of persons listed therein who in fact knew the\n' The Government is not currently planning to offer trial evidence regarding Mr. Rodriguez,\nalthough it may if the Court concludes that evidence is critical to the authentication question.\n> The defendant erroneously suggests that Mr. Rodriguez stopped working for Epstein in 2oo4.\n(ll/l5/2l Def.

Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater. As Mr. Alessi explained in testimony this Court deemed\ninadequate to authenticate the exhibit, Exhibit 52 is not the same as the books he saw during his\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Mr. Epstein.

Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52.

In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o).

(Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v.

According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in 2oo2. (Tr. 2332-33,\n2376-77).° Espinosa further testified that in the last two years of her <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> (2ooo-2oo2),\n\n8 Larry Visoski initially testified that he thought Sarah Kellen was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant.

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

Alessi worked for Epstein at his Palm Beach house from\napproximately l99o until approximately 2oo2.

See 35o4-o47. Alessi identified the\nbook by the cover, binding, formating, and variation in the entries. Alessi also reviewed the\nentries inside the book and identified numerous entries as containing contact information for\nindividuals that he specifically recalls being included in the copies of the books he remembers\nseeing in Palm Beach. That includes the entry for the witness testifying as “Jane,” see GX 52-F,\nand the entry for Florida masseuses—including some of the individuals on that list, see GX 52-G.\nAlthough this version of the contact book post-dates his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Epstein, Alessi was able\nto determine that fact in part by noticing that his oun contact information had been removed from\nthe book.’\n\nD Alesel alae explained that thane were two similar-looking books, one for Epstein and one for the\ndefendant.\n3 Alessi generally recalls the book being thicker and featuring a larger font size.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New Hampshire property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool99lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019948.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page89 of 2oo 26\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arrest of Mr. Epstein.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020076.jpg": "Caseab2o-cre6o BROAN DEctIMer? loo2 Filed6R2a38/?gPagetl Goof 36\nFrench law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign ties, wealth, and skill at\navoiding detection continue to weigh in favor of detention.\n\nFirst, there can be no serious dispute that the defendant has foreign ties. She is a citizen\nof three countries and holds three passports. As was already noted at the original hearing and is\nagain evidenced in the Renewed Bail Application, the defendant has close relatives and friends\nwho live abroad, as well as a multi-million dollar foreign property and at least one foreign bank\naccount. (Tr. 83). In an atempt to minimize the defendant’s foreign ties, the defense emphasizes\nthe defendant’s relatives and friends in the United States, history of residence in the United States,\nand United States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its\noriginal detention decision. (See Tr. 84; Dkt. l8 at 2, l2). The leters and documentation included\nin the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. What that\ndocumentation does not do, houever, is suggest that the defendant has the kind of ties to this\ncountry that come with any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States or any dependents living here.\nIndeed, as noted in the Pretrial Services Report, the defendant stated in July that she has no children\nand has no current <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>. (Pretrial Services Report at 3).\n\nThe Renewed Bail Motion fails to establish sufficiently strong ties to the United States that\nwould prevent her from fleeing. Although the defendant nou claims her marriage would keep her\nin the United States, her motion does not address the plainly inconsistent statements she made to\nPretrial Services at the time of her arrest, when, as documented in the Pretrial Services Report, the\ndefendant said she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (/d.). On this point, it bears\nnoting that the defendant’s motion asks that she be permited to live with i if granted bail,\nnot her spouse. Moreover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only nou come forward to\nsupport the defendant should be afforded litle weight given that he refused to come forward at the\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo76", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020091.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BGAN DEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBisef 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)).\n\nThe Court’s concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the\nevidence submited in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has\nsubmited a litany of leters of support writen by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,\nExs. A N, W X. These leters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has\nsignificant ties to the United States and atest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on the leter writen by her spouse, whose identity and connection to\nthe Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at ll-l3.\n\nIn that leter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that\nthe Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was\nbelied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ll; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A\n§§ 4-5. Other leters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the\nUnited States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.\n\nThese leters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people in\nthe United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant nou argues that\nher newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but\nat the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be geting divorced. See\nPretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be\nreleased on bail, undercuting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable\nburden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in financial transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her financial situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020240.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page6 of 25\n\nby charges involving minor victims and the potential penalties those charges carry.\n(Ud. at 82). Second, Judge Nathan determined that “[t]he government’s evidence at\nthis early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple victims who\nprovided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as\nwell as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, Judge Nathan found that Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics demonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83).\n\nl2. In addressing that third factor, Judge Nathan emphasized\nMaxwell’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections\nabroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). Judge Nathan\nnoted that Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite\nits citizens.” (/d.). She found that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial\nresources” and “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the\nresources available.” Ud. at 83-84).\n\nl3.

Judge Nathan found that Maxwell “continues to have substantial\ninternational ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad.” (/d. at ll). Judge Nathan was\nunpersuaded by Maxwell’s offer to consent to extradition, noting that the “legal\nweight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained\n“fundamentally unchanged.” (/d. at ll-l3). Judge Nathan further explained that\nMaxwell’s “extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide her the means\nto flee the country and to do so undetected.” (/d. at l3). Judge Nathan acknouledged\nthat “leters of support” writen by friends and family “substantiate the Defendant’s\nclaim that she has important ties to people in the United States,” but found that the\nleters “leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden” for Maxwell in light of, among other things, her claim at\nthe time of arrest that she was geting divorced, her lack of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, and her\nsignificant ties to family and friends abroad. (/d. at l4-l5).\n\n2o.

Judge\nNathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”\nlacks “any dependents, significant family ties or <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> in the United States,”\nand made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not\nprovide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).\nAccordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even\nthe most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s\nappearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her\nfinancial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to\nprovide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the\ndefense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the\nprocess was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 9o-9l).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o364", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020447.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page6l of 9l\nthat covers the person's nose and mouth.

(Comey,\nMaurene) (Entered: ll/l2/2o2l)\n\nll/l2/2o2l 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nmotion seeking clarification on two items from the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the\nCourt noted at the November l conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a\nspecific employer, but the type and genre of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> may be relevant to the jury's\nassessment of credibilty.

They did not overlap. There was a\nl7 break. That is corroborated by Juan Alessi no less, who said\nl8 the same thing. He said Sarah Kellen came at the end of my\n\nl9 <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, to his recollection, and as soon as she got there,\n2o she took over the responsibility of scheduling the massage\n2l appointments. Again, a clear break.\n22 What the record shous is that there was a replacement.\n23 Sarah Kellen replaced Ms. Maxwell, at least according to the\n24 trial testimony; not that there was some sort of ongoing\n25 supervision by Ms. Maxwell over Sarah Kellen.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021205.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page33 of 258\nSA-3l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 348\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H.

In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them.

Why don’t we just move forward?”\na4 Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n95 Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l259", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021315.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAT 3536o38, Pagel43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.’ Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!** Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\niss The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\n\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021316.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel44 of 258\nSA-l42\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\n\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021577.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document oe ON_AOL 3536o39, Pagel47 of 2l7\n32\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl already been decided or conceded by the defendant.

This argument mis-\nreads the relevant statutes and legislative history, and\nruns contrary to the decisions of this Court and other\nCourts of Appeals.!!\na. Counts Three and Four Are Offenses\nInvolving the Sexual Abuse of a\nChild\n\nMaxwell’s entire argument is based on a mistaken\npremise: that the phrase “offense involving the sexual\n... abuse ... of a child,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283, only encom-\npasses crimes in which “unlawful sexual activity actu-\nally took place.” (Br.44). This flawed proposition ig-\nnores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear\nthat Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include of-\nfenses in which there was no completed illegal sex act.\n\nAs described above, Section 3283 was originally\ncodified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k). The definition of the\nterm “sexual abuse” is located within that same sec-\ntion:\n\nFor purposes of this section ... the term\n‘sexual abuse’ includes the <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement,\n\nll Maxwell raises no analogous argument with re-\nspect to Count Six, which charges sex trafficking of a\nminor, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021704.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page57 of 93\n44\n\nor coercion of a child to engage in, or as-\n\nsist another person to engage in, sexually\n\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation,\n\nprostitution, or other form of sexual ex-\n\nploitation of children, or incest with chil-\n\ndren.\nl8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit con-\nduct” is in turn defined to mean, among other things,\n“sexual intercourse, including sexual contact”; and the\nterm “sexual contact” means “the intentional touching,\neither directly or through clothing, of the genitalia,\nanus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or butocks of any per-\nson with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, de-\ngrade, or arouse or gratify sexual desire of any person.”\nId. § 35o9(a)(9)(A). Courts have looked to the defini-\ntion of “sexual abuse” set forth in Section 35o9(a) to\ndetermine whether the statute of limitations of Section\n3283 applies to an offense. United States v. Carpenter,\n68o F.3d llol, llo3-o4 (9th Cir. 2ol2) (‘We join our\nsister circuits in looking to subsection 35o9(a) for a def-\ninition of ‘sexual abuse’ under federal law, and find it\nthe appropriate definition to use in applying section\n3283's extended statute of limitations.”).\n\nThe definition of “sexual abuse” includes not only\nactual “sexual contact,” but also the “the <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>,\nuse, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\nof a child to engage in, or assist another person to en-\ngage in,” sexual contact. l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a).

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of child pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not\nuncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nConsistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is\nintertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and\nlikenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> history.\n\nOne of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bringing justice to\nvictims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\n\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information\nregarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is\nthe determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023008.jpg": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023022.jpg": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.?

The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023043.jpg": "Kirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International\nUniversity College of Law. In April 2ol7, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he\nresigned from that post effective July l9, 2ol9, follouing public criticism of the USAO’s handling\nof the Epstein case.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in l99o as a line AUSA. In 2ool, he became Deputy\nChief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in\n2oo3, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his l3-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two\nterms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity\nSection, first from September 2ool until September 2oo2, and then from February 2oo6 until July\n2oo6. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel. During September 2oo7, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie\ntransitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023097.jpg": "to OPR that she “wanted to knou whether this leter went out.

Sloman similarly told OPR that the squad supervisor “like\n[Villafafia] .. . [a]nd the agents felt very strongly about the case.”\n\nC. August — September 2oo7: Epstein Hires Additional Atorneys, Who Meet\n\nwith Acosta\nl. Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein’s New Atorneys\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Epstein’s team was “incensed” that Acosta would not meet with\nthem and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time,\nEpstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkouitz, two prominent atorneys from the law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> a decade earlier as an associate\nat the firm.** On the evening of August 6, 2oo7, Sloman emailed Acosta: “Just saw Menchel. I\ndidn’t knou Kirkland made a call into you. You were right. Unbelievable.” During their OPR\ninterviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could\nprovide no additional information about the contact.?> A reply email from Acosta to Sloman\nindicates that the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys were considering elevating to the Department their\nobjections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. In that email, Acosta stated, “They\nare likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should\nbe made clear.”\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein’s] atorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds\n\nof a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them. I’m concerned\n\nthat this will delay maters.\n\nI am thinking of heading this off, by (l) agreeing to meet to discuss\n\ngeneral legal policy only (the only mater in which DC has arguable\n2 In an email to Lourie reporting the conversation, Sloman reported that he told the squad supervisor that “it’s\na tad more complicated” and commented, “The guy is killing me.” The squad supervisor told OPR that he did not\nremember this exchange with Sloman, but he recalled the agents being “upset” with the proposed resolution of the\ncase and he likely would have told Sloman, “When do we indict? Why don’t we just move forward?”\na Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September l995 to March l997, he\nhad worked on at least one mater each with Starr and Lefkouitz, and since that time, he had professional\nacquaintanceships with both.\n9s Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which\nhe entered Acosta’s office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, “[T]hat was Ken Starr,”\nand told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023153.jpg": "for up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney Black a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded Black that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>.'*? Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, Black responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!®4 Black noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl85 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 Black forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023154.jpg": "Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail. ...\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023188.jpg": "reconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023373.jpg": "referred to as a “round sheet”) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in\nfact, they had not.°\nOn November l9, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\nreturned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple\ncounts each of falsification of records, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, lool(a)(3), and 2.

It was his responsibility to prepare the house for\nEpstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private\nplane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein\nreceives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that touards\nthe end of his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi\nstated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's\nbedroom or bathroom.

Epstein would have\none massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated\nhe would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would\nmeet with them.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was |\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. Cr WES ym yt =\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. 7c it al\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere is no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\nhtn-/ww_orinthi s.clickahilitv eomivalent antennae Pena That Pantaciee de Reco Request Noy A aeRRe\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031424.jpg": "Mate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 57\nStine: l57ol5 37 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\ntase Nou « = « & E-o5-ooo368 (Cont inued)\nFronstin had telephoned her reference this case.

For years, Epstein had\nhad a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the\ndaughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died\nmysteriously off his yacht in l99l. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father\nand that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas\nsays he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell] spent time at the Palm Beach house,\nand the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was\nfive years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never shoued up in all the surveillance,\nonly her stationery.\nEpstein’s activities seem to have devolved in recent years, Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told\npolice that touard the end of his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, the girls were “younger and younger,” and he often had to\nwash off vibrators and “a long rubber penis” teft in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez,\nsaid that he found the sex toys he had to wash “scatered on the floor. gy WES yom nit -\nNo need to worry about dirty laundry, if there’s someone to do it. Four {\"\nThe U.S. atorney’s investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would\nbe imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein\nwill not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state atorney on the prostitution charge.\nNot that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the\nair that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endoued him with uter\nshamelessness, the emperor’s new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the\nmoral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the\nsocial contract was not made in good faith. Epstein’s friends say that on this mater, he has a\nphilosophical position.\n“Fundamentally,” Wolff says, “it’s about math. That on a macro Jevel it mevitably happens that the rich\nget richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey’s point is that this\nwhole issue is—it’s just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more\nsuccessful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater\nthe discrepancy actually is.”\nThere ts no beter place to observe hou Epstein’s mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of\nlife are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from\nBulgar and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls\ncame from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters,\nand pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson’s house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch.\nAn atractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams\nit. “We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case.”\nDriving home with their $5oo, Haley said to the l4-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they’d\nbe rich, and it’s understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might fee! that way. The coldest\nstories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman’s wife,\nsaid she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation\nwith him. He made it clear that he did “not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm\nBeach.” One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.\n4 Yentord = |\nhtn:/hanans meinthic clickahility eam/nt/ent?action=ent&tle=ThetFantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 28 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032303.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: l8\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 inued)\ninvestigation.

Detective Recarey reports that\n“Alessi stated that touards the end of his <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>, the masseuses were\nyounger and younger”. (Police Report at 57).

This statement is\ndirectly contradicted by other witness statements, which are devoid of any\n\n| accusation by any woman that any activity ever occurred on the bed. Indeed,\nAlessi himself actually stated that on a “few” occasions the bed was unmade after\na massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (Transcript at ll-l2). Alessi\nfurther explained that even in the absence of a massage he could be called upon to\nmake Epstein’s bed three or four times a day, (id), thus providing an innocent\nexplanation for the frequent bed making. It was in fact Detective Recarey who\nsuggested that “something else occurred”, and even then, Alessi insisted he did not\nknou of “something else”: “. . . or something else, I cannot [say]”. (/d.).\n\nThere is also no mention of Alessi’s burglary of the Epstein residence; his\ntheft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi’s suicidal ideations, all of\nwhich made him an unreliable witness.\n\no7/26/l7 Page 2277 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR- ooo3259o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032623.jpg": "vate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: a7\n\nime: l5:ol:27 —- Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n\n‘ase No. . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nFronstin had telephoned her reference this case.

OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\nidentified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing <span class=\"highlight\">employment</span> with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\n<span class=\"highlight\">employment</span>” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023373.tif": "referred to as a “round sheet’) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in\nfact, they had not.°\nOn November l9, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\nreturned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple\ncounts each of falsification of records, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, lool(a)(3), and 2.
