Dr. Rocchio’s fourth\nopinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or\ninducement.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on\nanticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if\nthe Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion\nmay become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in\nfully disclosing sexual abuse. At the Daubert hearing, the Defense stated that they intended to\npursue both lines of impeachment at trial. Nov. lo Tr. at l56-57. The Court therefore finds\nthese elements of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony relevant to maters the Defense intends to put in issue\nduring anticipated cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the\nother relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding\nconcepts that require expert knouledge without directing the jury to reach any conclusion as to a\nwitness’s credibility.

First,\n“Thjindsight bias is a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’”\nAdams v. Lab’y Corp. of Am., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). Because the expert’s\n“opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common knouledge and common\nsense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp. Holdings, Inc., No. l6-CV-\n2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting 4 <span class=\"highlight\">Weinstein</span>’s Federal\nEvidence § 7o2.o3 (2ol9)). Indeed, neither the Government nor the Court could identify a\nfederal court that has admited expert testimony on the jury’s hindsight bias. Gov’t Br. at l4.\nThe Defense cites no such case law in its response. Second, even if the jury’s hindsight bias\nwere a relevant topic of expert testimony, the Court would exclude it because of Rule 4o3\nprejudice. The Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess evidence and determine Ms.\nMaxwell’s intent. An expert instruction on hindsight bias risks confusing the jury and usurping\nthe Court’s role in instructing the jury as to the law. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 397.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion on the so-called halo effect. Specifically, the Defense\nexpects that Dr. Dietz would testify that an individual’s positive traits—like atractiveness,\ncharisma, intelligence, and status—can cause other people to overlook the individual’s negative\ntraits. Notice at 5—6. Dr. Dietz would testify that Jeffrey Epstein “exploited the Halo effect to\nsurround himself with people who would serve his needs” while “compartmentaliz[ing]” what\nthey knew about his activities.

In the past, coupling voir dire with prospective jurors swearing an oath to tell\nthe truth was a pouerful way to eliminate bias, but the oath no longer carries the force that it once\ndid. As a former Chief Judge of this Court remarked:\n\nWhen our judicial system was established and the requirement of an oath or affirmation\n\non the part of a witness was borroued from the British common law, the swearing of an\n\noath meant something—namely, that the court could be fairly sure that a witness would\n\ntell the truth. In the time of our Founding Fathers, witnesses believed that they would be\n\nsubject to severe and perhaps immediate Divine retribution if they lied under oath on the\n\nwitness stand, based on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed doun by God to\n\nMoses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 2o,\n\nVerse l6 (King James Version)).

The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on\nthese maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s inaccurate answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges. Jd. at 265 (“Our rule differs from its federal\ncounterpart.”); (Def. Mem. at 46-47 (citing Scher, 278 N.J. Super. at 263)).\n7 The only exceptions to this are inquiries as to whether “(A) extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the jury’s atention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). “A juror’s personal experience . . . does not constitute ‘extraneous prejudicial\ninformation.’” Marquez v. City of Albuquerque, 399 F.3d l2l6, l223 (loth Cir. 2oo5) (quoting 3\nJack B. <span class=\"highlight\">Weinstein</span> & Margaret A.

United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey <span class=\"highlight\">Weinstein</span>. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, <span class=\"highlight\">Weinstein</span> received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range calculated by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey <span class=\"highlight\">Weinstein</span>” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Pagel5ofl7\nor emotional condition, her statements made to Dr. Hall ing about events that took place\nyears earlier cannot be said to be “then-existing.” /d. The Defense also says Alleged Victim 4’s\nstatements were “made for medical diagnosis or treatment.” Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(4). The Court\nfinds that this may be a permissible basis for admiting some of Alleged Victim 4’s statements,\nthough they must be “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment,” must “describe[ ] medical\nhistory; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and must\notherwise satisfy Rules 4ol and 4o3.

The Court concludes that Alleged Victim 4’s LF are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o9. Dr. Hall’s report is not clear on the details of Alleged Victim 4’s\nee\nes These incidents,\nhouever, are nou all over lo years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest act or false\nstatement,” and, for i. admiting the evidence is not necessary to fairly\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of Ms. Maxwell.
