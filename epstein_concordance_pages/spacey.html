On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin <span class=\"highlight\">Spacey</span>.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin <span class=\"highlight\">Spacey</span>,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031405.jpg": "Received: l/l3/o8 3:l4PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 4\nl/ll/2888 2l:4o 56l648442o x As x\n\nminutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert’s\nstatements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“Tt was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a litle food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall I say\n\n| this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it7” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin <span class=\"highlight\">Spacey</span> to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032043.jpg": "M f. liciting charse\ne i |\nystery money man faces soliciting charge\n—ByNICOLEJANOK Epstein was indicted last vice’ bya convictions. | | ae ae\nee enum ko ik state grand jury, according to state at- Houever, checks of court records [2 «4\nA part-time Palm Beacher who has _ torney’s spokesman Mike Edmondson. _ here and in New York Sunday turned up oS\nsocialized with Donald Trump, Bill Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment nosuchconvictions. .. ss ig ee\nClinton and Kevin <span class=\"highlight\">Spacey</span> was jailed containing the allegations remained Epstein could not be reached.
